"1","Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars."
"2","Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life."
"1","I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money."
"1","I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!"
"2","All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The \""Wet Cajun\"" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\n\nThe dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  \""Pittsburgh Dad\"" would love this place n'at!!"
"1","Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent."
"1","Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh."
"1","This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be."
"2","Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nIt's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \n\nThe guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. \n\nA big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\n\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again."
"2","I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!"
"1","After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service."
"2","Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911."
"2","After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n\nOh...but good food counts too. \n\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh."
"2","This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back."
"2","Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!"
"1","Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting."
"1","Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\""t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good."
"1","I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \nI took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire \""this time\"". \nI will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!"
"1","Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time."
"2","I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring!"
"1","Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing."
"1","I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n\nHere's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \""there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\"" Well, that didn't happen.\n\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone."
"1","Hoofah."
"1","Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on."
"1","Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n\nFrom what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen."
"2","If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.\nEnjoy...."
"2","Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's"
"2","Good Luck getting a seat, that's all I have to say. The Gab and Eat is famous and infamous. Diner food is what's up and I like it. When I was a roofing mechanic, we'd meet there before work. Although I'm not sure I would recommend it if you're working were there's no bathrooms. hehe"
"2","The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.\n\nHUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.\n\nI've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.\n\nCramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination."
"2","Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!"
"2","I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. \n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.\n-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\n-Cash only\n-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack\n-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.\n-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo"
"2","Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive."
"2","Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.\n\nWhat's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.\n\nOnly bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in."
"2","Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious."
"2","I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\""  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n\nWe want to return sometime for \""turkey day.\""  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n\nCan't wait to return."
"2","Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  \n\nBarb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.\n\nI know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!"
"2","Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here."
"1","My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\n\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\n\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\n\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\n\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\n\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's."
"2","I've stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. \n\nThe rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \""full kitchen\"" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. \n\nThe room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. \n\nThe best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it."
"1","If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \""pies\"". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \""they were out\"". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once."
"1","Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \n\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons."
"1","The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell, having confused 133 and 113.\n\nRather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation, he begins to accuse my wife and I of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.\n\nThe driver then gets on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than was given when the order was placed, begins to call his bosses and starts threatening me with felony charges. \n\nSo I take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er was, phone my neighbor and discover the mistake. Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\n\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town."
"1","Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\"" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \""steak\"" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!"
"2","Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!"
"1","By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!"
"1","In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\n\nWhen I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.\n\nIt was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.\n\nThe door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.\n\nThe office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.\n\nI recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\n\nPoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review."
"2","This is by far the best dentist I have ever been to.  She is honest and never trys to sell you a bunch a stuff that you dont need. We are very great full that we discovered her. We adjust our vacations to make sure that we stop in to her office in Pennsylvania at least once a year for cleaning and check ups, worth the drive from Florida."
"1","I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else"
"1","Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food."
"1","I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking."
"1","All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so."
"1","We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back."
"2","Went for breakfast on 6/16/14. We received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.Waitress could have smiled more but was friendly. \nI had a Grand Slam... it was more than enough food. \nMeal was very tasty... We will definitely go back. \nIt is a popular Denny's."
"2","Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal, waitress was such an adorable girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great job!\nStrawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it was :) \nStrawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!\nIts always nice when u go late at night like us, it is not crowded, not noisy, nice music playing and always nice people around. \nIf you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!"
"2","I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!"
"1","I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?"
"1","If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!"
"2","Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN."
"2","Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\n\nLike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  \n\nThe bar was jumping thou never go to the bar."
"1","Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!"
"2","Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \n\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\n\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time."
"2","OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \n\nAdvice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service."
"2","Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try."
"1","I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n\nBut it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \""mistake\"" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at."
"2","This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness."
"1","Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\n\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \n\nAmbiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \""musts\"" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!"
"1","Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \""just\"" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes ...."
"1","Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood"
"1","Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !\nThere is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service."
"1","Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie."
"2","I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \n\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\n\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back."
"2","Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.\n\nWe LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)\n\nThe one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... \n\nNow... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!\n\nThe place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   \n\nSo good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!"
"1","Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\"" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back."
"1","I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."
"1","We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service."
"1","Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG."
"1","Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh."
"1","I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them."
"1","THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \""dentist\"" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \""you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\"". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \""bone graft\"". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \""dentist\"" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers."
"1","The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time."
"1","Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n\nThen again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO."
"1","My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\nThe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \""serving off their orders\"" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!"
"1","I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \n\nWhenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \n\nToday was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\"" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\n\nThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\n\nI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!"
"1","This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  \n\nOrder:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.\n\nThe soda machine was broken.   No sodas.\n\nThen I got to the window.  \""We rang you up for medium fries.\""   (Not what I asked for)  \""Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.\""\n\nLeft with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there..."
"1","We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \n\nOne of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \n\nSpoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n\nWhen I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \""Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\"" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\n\nNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \n\nI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening!"
"1","Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00\n\nOn this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.\n\nMy baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. \n\nThe waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet."
"1","Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: \n\n1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.\n\n2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.\n\nAside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service."
"1","If there was ever a \""get your coffee and go\"" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building."
"2","Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff."
"2","Regarding quality of beverage, this is just your average Starbucks. I can't complain but am not blown away either. However, I really like the location of this shop, which is located in the center of The Waterfront's specialty retail shops. Though in the midst of a lot of retail, the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass, flowers, and a fountain. Hanging out here is very relaxing."
"1","This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\n\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\n\nBaristas are friendly and fast."
"1","I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area."
"1","For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.  There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  \n\nI'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?\n\nFINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're \""low on payroll\"" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!\n\nNot a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.  \n\nHey Michael, do you pick up what I'm putting down?  You're not making any money because your costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's no service to be found!"
"2","It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend."
"1","The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \n\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \n\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to."
"1","You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. \n\nThey are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.\n\nThe organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called \""art supplies\"". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. \n\nWhat did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. \n\nSo, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael's."
"2","The food is good and its CHEAP.\n\nI mean REALLY INEXPENSIVE.\n\n$4.00 for a burger and fries. Add a coke and its like $10.00-$13.00 for two people.  Seldom if ever crowded. \n\nService can be a tad slow but hit or miss.\n\nThey also do breakfast and its a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.\n\nTry the shakes, they're great."
"1","This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. \n\nThe bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food, the food itself was just so crappily made. It was so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time (c'mon, Steak N Shake is basically a glorified McD's), our waiter comped our WHOLE MEAL.\n\nIf not for the compensation, I would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal. The bf, on the other hand, was more upset about the principle of the matter... we had trekked all that way just to get our Steak N Shake fix (since both of us haven't had it since our undergraduate days) and it was a major fail.\n\nI think I'm good with my Steak N Shake craving for a long time now...\n\n\n\nPS. The whole joint smells like major B.O."
"1","I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush, and the restaurant was maybe 20% full. I ordered the Chili Mac Supreme to go. I thought I would be in and out within 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that this restaurant even has a drive-thru; the expectation is quick service.\n\nLong story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier."
"1","Well... as Steak 'n Shake locations go, this isn't the best one around--but it is burgers and fries that are open 24-7.\n\nThe milkshakes are good!\n\nPROS: \nAlways made fresh, when you order;\n\nCONS:\nGreasy (but its burgers);\nTakes longer than typical in drive thru (but that's bc they're made fresh!);\nService (on a scale of 1-10, 10 being awesome) is a 4."
"1","In general I do like Shake N' Steak, but this location is a hit or miss location!  You never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...\n\nBy far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake!"
"1","Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well!"
"1","The only thing worse than the food is the service."
"1","Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n  \n  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging."
"1","This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo."
"1","I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service."
"1","Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds."
"1","The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \n\nThe burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed."
"1","I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\n\nGranted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  \n\nWhile sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\n\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \""steakburger\"" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\n\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again."
"1","You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \n\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\""You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\"". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \""bathroom break\"", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach."
"1","I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there."
"1","I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow..."
"1","Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour."
"1","Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order."
"1","This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \n\nIt's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well, the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, Walk In OR Drive Thru.\n\nJust take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine."
"1","This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \""doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\"" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers."
"1","Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.\n\nI do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking, sitting and texting.  I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the \""to do\"" list because there is no where else togo really....\n\nWhy didn't they answer me at the drive through? I think they wanted me to come inside because my girlfriend and I are really really really good looking.\n\nThis was annoying but understandable."
"1","It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders, and I got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice."
"2","Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!"
"2","This is probably my favorite store in Pittsburgh, for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing. Other stores carry the same stuff but for much, much more, and it's hard to find all the stuff that the Basement carries in one spot. (Yes, I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often."
"1","Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?"
"1","$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \""Paradise City\"" with the rest of the crowd."
"1","In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\n\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve."
"2","If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)"
"1","This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun."
"2","Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \n\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \n\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses."
"1","I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \""you bitch, you slut, you whore\"" and  \""twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\"" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not."
"1","He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls."
"2","I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done."
"2","This is the best place we've ever taken our cars to. Their customer service is outstanding. It appears that they really like doing what they do because they are always willing to explain everything in detail. I also like that they don't over charge. I completely trust them to be honest and do the best job possible."
"1","I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \n\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \""oh, and we don't take checks\"". \n\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \""yes, of course\"". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times."
"1","When making a Customer's paymento atLowe's, we have our checklist:\n\n1. Do the phone numbers match?  Nope, but that's fine since people are always changing their phone numbers anyways.\n2. Does the name on account match name on check?  Nope, but mistakes happen at those pesky check companies.\n3. Does the account number on the check match the account number on the screen?  Why should it, those computers are always making mistakes.\n\nNow that we have verified that all the information is correct, we can process the payment.

"1","This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout."
"1","There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front."
"1","Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order."
"1","I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\n\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \n\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \n\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\n\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it."
"2","One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family."
"1","D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\n\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\n\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\n\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\n\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant."
"1","Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\n\nMy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.  \n\nI like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead."
"1","Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \n\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \n\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\n\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century."
"1","The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \n\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \n\nThe manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free."
"2","We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion."
"1","Not much of a review for this one, but just a few tidbits of info...\n\nPool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour\n(I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)\n\nMixed drinks are way too pricey for the location.\nThe food is crap.\n\nThe games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).\n\nThat is all.  :)\n\n(the pricing is based on my recent trip.\nWe shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60"
"1","When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork."
"1","Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \""Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\"". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!"
"1","This place just plain sucks\nBad management lost them biz\nDumb arcade drama*\n\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old"
"2","Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food."
"1","Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service"
"1","My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!"
"1","Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back."
"1","To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \n\nWhat an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead."
"2","I still love this place!  I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  It's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price!"
"1","I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat."
"1","My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced."
"1","Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu"
"1","SUMMARY:\nIf I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\n\nGOOD:\n- Decent beer...\n- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\n- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\n- Amusing name.\n\nBAD:\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\n\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low."
"1","Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \""kind of like Coors Light\"".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n\nThe food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though."
"1","My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around."
"1","Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom."
"2","Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious."
"2","First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back."
"2","Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly."
"2","I love this place!  Great atmosphere and friendly service every time I go!!"
"1","I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!"
"1","I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \""brewery\"" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!"
"1","For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95."
"1","I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \""nice\"" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\n\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future."
"1","Slow service\nBelow average food \nIll pass"
"2","First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing."
"1","Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \""OK\"".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \n\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\n\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!"
"1","Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\n\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n \nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed."
"2","I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \n\nPlease support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
"1","Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing."
"2","I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. \nI think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless."
"1","So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink..."
"2","Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience."
"2","My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat."
"1","Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\n\nOn to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic."
"2","Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\n\nMy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. \n\nOverall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!"
"1","The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience."
"1","The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \""foodie\"" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it."
"1","Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around."
"2","I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. \n\nI prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. \n\nNachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. \n\nThis is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. \n\nThey have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. \n\nService is always great whether there are two or 10 of us."
"2","BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. \n\nI came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalape\u00f1o cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work."
"2","I always enjoy a good comedy club and though I'm a loyal Helium fan, I gotta give props to the Improv near Pittsburgh. They chose a great location, with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping. \n\nWe bought tickets to see a comedian I had never heard of (he was decent) for $25 each with a two item purchase minimum. I really dislike that rule but you can't really get around it. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like, aka hated, was having to wait in line outside before the show started. It was freeeeezing! They should put heaters outside. seriously."
"1","My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \n\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers."
"1","The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\n\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \n\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \n\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \n\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again."
"1","The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n\nIt's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \""Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\""  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \""would you like a refill on that?\"" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \""would you like another one?\"" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \""we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\""  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings."
"1","My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon."
"1","We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\u00e9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \""event\"". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\n\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars."
"2","I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\n\nSo I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\n\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \n\nThe one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  \n\nI would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!"
"1","It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! \""What about our food?\"", we asked. \""Oh\"", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was \""do you want me to take your food back?\"". Really?!?! \""Do you want me to take your food back?\"" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day."
"2","I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!"
"2","Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back."
"1","So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\u00e9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better."
"2","Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection."
"2","As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district."
"2","Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they've expanded and reorganized, I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie! There's a wine kiosk (suck it PA liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as Market District. I do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, I suppose."
"1","This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here."
"2","Just about every you need.\n\nWith great hours, a solid hot bar, sushi (if you're into that),  a dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons of produce, bakery and butchers counter you can't go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front. I always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back, super annoying. \n\nThat said its a small, and easily repairable (hint) issue that shouldn't keep you from visiting."
"1","Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \n\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\n\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this."
"1","I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \""The Hangover\"" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \""The Hangover\"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse."
"2","Fantastic food.\n This place is mainly a \""bar\"" and does get crowded but I really like the pizza here.  In fact I've never had a bad meal.  The staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded."
"1","The words \""epic fail\"" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\n\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\n\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm.  Drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow.  We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\n\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we'd given up on after waiting almost an hour.  We just wanted to leave.\n\nInstead of comping anything, they added 18% gratuity to each of our bills.  Uhhhh yeah.  Thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back.   We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\n\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me."
"1","I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\n\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \""definitely\"" put our order in so it \""must have been given to someone else by mistake.\"" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?\n\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\n\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no."
"1","Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\n\nRemember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\n\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\n\nNow here comes the bad:\n\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\n\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\n\n3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\n\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again."
"1","We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\n\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\n\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back."
"1","When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\n\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies."
"1","I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\n\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \n\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service."
"1","I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out."
"1","The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!"
"2","haha only came here once for happy hour, but i am just pleased with the price. i guess coming from ny, anything would be better price wise. $3 for draft and a big selection of beers so good times. also it's right across the theater so it's a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha."
"1","This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price."
"1","Servers are chatting, not paying attention to tables. I can see my salad is ready at the window. Worst serves ever."
"1","Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \n\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \n\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\n\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street."
"1","I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there."
"1","We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself."
"1","I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street."
"1","The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!"
"1","Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well"
"1","Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\n\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait."
"1","Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality."
"1","I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.\n\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \""wowed\"" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\n\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.\n\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon."
"1","The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don't think I got the passes worth. \n\nThe waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.\n\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \n\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \n\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect.\"" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\n\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax.\n\nIf you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer."
"1","It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location."
"2","So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)"
"1","Dont waste your time with this place.  Long lines, overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait. Half the \""rides\"" were shut down. You're better off with a garden hose. Save your money or buddy up to someone with a pool."
"1","Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \""okay\"" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \""family\"" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. \n\nThey do have an \""adult pool\"" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. The pool is very small, similar to one you'd find at a hotel chain. It has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. It wasn't too impressive to me. \n\nThey also have a lazy river at this park and, while I do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. People kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. \n\nThe one attraction that I did enjoy was the wave pool. It was crowded as well but large enough to fit everybody comfortably. The water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. I could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.\n\nOverall, this place is just mediocre. It doesn't \""wow\"" me very much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking for somewhere to go in the summer other than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun."
"2","For some reason, I had a tremendous amount of anxiety about buying a new mattress. Maybe I was just self-conscious about rolling around on a bunch of beds in a public place. \n\nABD Mattress quickly alleviated any idiotic fears I may have had. The store was empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon and I was attended to immediately and never felt pressured. ABD has a great selection of mattresses, and the prices cannot be beat. I picked up a full plush pillow-top mattress for a cool $375 (without a box spring or a frame, since I already had one). Better yet? Delivery is free AND prompt. You pick a three-hour timeframe, and the store will call you on the day of delivery to narrow it to a one-hour slot so you're not sitting around all afternoon."
"2","After reading glowing reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this service to pick up my 83 year old mother and take her to the airport. Service was great. Driver was very courteous and on time. We used them to pick her up at the airport and are equally happy. The driver even carried her suitcases upstairs to her apartment."
"2","Fabulous service all around. My husband was coming in on a redeye flight from San Diego around 9am on Saturday morning, and just before midnight on Friday, I realized I wasn't going to be able to pick him up. I called First Class Limousine Service around 12:30am and was pleasantly surprised that someone picked up. I ended up speaking to Dave, the owner, and he was able to accommodate my last-minute request. \n\nMy husband initially went to the wrong meeting place (on account of his sleep deprivation :) so the company called me asap when he didn't show up right away--I reminded hubby about the correct meeting spot and all went well after that. He was very happy with the service and the price. I'd definitely use this company again for rides to and from the airport! Thanks everyone!"
"1","Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott, was completely clueless in navigating the city. Constantly making wrong turns and missing exits. All of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really?!??!  Why??!!  How??!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. \n\nJust when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. \n\nSo if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!"
"1","The worse \""Chinese food\"", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food."
"2","Haven't been to TGIFridays for years and was never really a huge fan. I get tired of going to the same places all the time for lunch so we decided to try it out. I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back."
"1","This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho"
"1","Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad."
"1","I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \""chain\"" expectation. \n\nI order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.\n\nFortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly. \n\nI'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day."
"1","I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!"
"1","Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Maybe they were short handed.  The food was to me not even average. I ordered a burger, which very overdone and dry. Had to drown it in mayo to get moisture in it.  My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalape\u00f1o slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them."
"2","Good food.  \n\nI guess one reason I like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. There is a little Kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  All in all I get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them\n\nThe steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.\n\nService is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat"
"1","I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!"
"1","I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \n\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \n\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \""chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\""  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \""drizzling\"" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\n\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \n\nThe \""numero uno\"" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \n\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \n\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling."
"1","Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!"
"1","I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:\n\nFrench onion\nChicken bites\nPizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano\n\nLooking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good. \n\nI really never want to return."
"1","Food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side Ass mashed potatoes. Everything was ok not a lot of flavor."
"1","Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark."
"1","The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good."
"2","Wham! 4 stars outta the park! The deep-dish pizza we had was amazing. I wasn't crazy about the avocado egg rolls, but the chocolate chip sundae was superb. Great service too from Maranda, a doll. Decor is cute. Ambience is lively. Recommended."
"1","Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!!\nWe were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more).\nLater when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \""okay\"", not even a sorry once!!!\nI would not like to go there again... :("
"2","While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!"
"1","Nope!"
"1","Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well"
"1","Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but that's not what the online menu states. And it's a salad come on.."
"1","Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.\n\nI will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.\n\nSo I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. \n\nI went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. \n\nThe girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.\n\nSo I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying \""Soooo, you DON'T want these???\"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! \n\nAfter that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). \n\nThe thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever."
"2","When I lived in Los Angeles a year and a half ago, P F Chang's was no great shakes, one of millions of places with good but not outstanding stuff on the menu.\n\nHere in Pittsburgh, it's the only Chinese place I've found that combines genuinely good service with quality food.  Not, perhaps, as good as what you can get in LA's top places, but fantastic compared to its competition here.\n\nThe Kung Pao chicken is particularly good, with delicious fried chicken cubes and the usual hot sauce and chiles.  Chicken with lettuce wraps is good too.\n\nTheir fried noodle dish with chicken, whose name I have forgotten, is addictive but has an odd sauce I don't quite like.  Still, they get the friedness of the noodles right, and there are precious few ... ahem ... no other restaurants around here that do.\n\nPortions are small, so either plan to get an appetizer and an entree or expect to leave almost as hungry as you came.  The minced chicken in lettuce wraps appetizer is outstanding and you get about the same amount of food as in one of their entrees.\n\nIf you live in LA, forget P F Chang's.  If you live in NYC, I'm sure there are a dozen better places on a single block.  But here in Pittsburgh, it's just about the best place around."
"1","I hate this place.\nIt's very loud, the service is very poor, and the food is so-so.\nIf you want good Chinese in Pittsburgh, try China Palace (Shadyside) or Sesame Inn (Station Square or North Hills).  They're quieter, with very good food & service."
"1","REDO!\n\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \n\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \n\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\n\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\n\nCoca Cola\nIced Tea\nPan fried pork dumplings\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\nChangs chicken with white rice\n\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\n\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\n\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \n\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better."
"1","Honestly, I'm furious. I enjoyed PF Chang's restaurants in the Chicago area, and my wife and I have eaten a few times at this Pittsburgh-area location. Over the last year, we have tried repeatedly, but the 90-120 minute wait for dinner is unacceptable. We tried going early, late -- it never made any difference. The front staff was rude, and the wait was too long.\n\nTonight, we had a special date planned, and made reservations a week in advance. We came in the door exactly on time, waited in the line to see the front staff, and we were promptly handed a pager. They couldn't tell us when we would be seated.\n\nI imagined a short wait, so we went outside, crossed into a store to wait (since the entrance of this location is so packed, it's impossible to wait at the bar or in the meager seating).\n\nAfter 20 minutes we gave up. We went back to PF Chang's and the front office staff still couldn't tell us when we would be seated. I saw open tables.\n\nWhat on earth is the point of accepting reservations if you do not honor them?\n\nThe food here is good, but certainly not great. We went to a local Thai place and were seated with no problem in 5 minutes. The food was much better, the service was good even in a crowded busy restaurant. Oh, and the local place was a much more reasonable price.\n\nWe certainly will never visit PF Chang's again."
"1","Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \""alright\"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price."
"2","My vegan friend, Deb, turned me onto the fact that one can dine at PF Chang's and stay on a vegan diet.\n\nVegan friend Deb (VFD) asked the waitress if they could prepare a version of the famous chicken and lettuce wraps. The waitress without hesitation proclaimed they always had a vegan version, but it was never put on the menu.\nWarning: even though it's vegan, it still contains the same amount of salt that was reported on all the news channels when the salt, fat, and cholesterol police made the sodium content available to the public. The vegan version is just as delicious and the chicken.\n\nThey also have vegan dishes like string beans and garlic, eggplant and garlic, and a few dishes with tofu and vegetables.\n\nI always loved the fact PF Chang's offered brown rice. That nutty flavor goes so well with their meals.\n\nThe service staff at Chang's is always top shelf, I've never had a bad time here and love when we go."
"2","So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food, which was what we were all surrounded by so I decided to give P.F. Chang's a try. \n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, so we had to wait 45min :( Luckily time went by fast while I was on my phone looking at the Yelp reviews for this place. When we were seated, we ordered immediately and our server was very friendly. We got the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer and then the Dan Dan noodles and Shanghai shrimp with garlic sauce. The food came out quick which was a huge plus considering how busy they were. The calamari was okay. I felt like the strips were cut too thin and we should have received more. The Dan Dan noodles were actually very delicious and flavorful. I really enjoyed them and definitely recommend them. The shrimp was cooked well and was also good. Overall I was happy with my first time experience here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the mood for Chinese/American food."
"1","The service was lackluster. Coffee was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup, apparently, as the waitress never offered a second.\n\nDaughter had sweet and sour shrimp. Wife had spicy chicken. I had wonton soup. Dumplings as an appetizer for the table. All arrived warm. The brown rice was dry as sand and the white rice was delayed by rice cooker problems. Also dry as sand. I guess that is how they serve it.\n\nThe base flavors for the shrimp and chicken were nearly identical. I had expected them to be more diverse. \n\nIn all, expectations were not met for what is advertised as upscale. I'd rather have the local Chinese cuisine which more flavorful, and much less expensive."
"1","This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. \n\nThey were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \""Asian Bistro.\"""
"1","I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers, but \nThere was NO presentation of pfc mixing sauces. \nOne of the things that sets pfc apart from the run of the mill Non franchise is PRESENTATION and experience.  I was extremely disappointed by the LACK of presentation. \n\nReservations:\nOur party arrived about 15 minutes before our 5:30 reservations.\n\nAt 6:11 we were informed our reserved table had been given to another party . Obviously someone dropped the ball here.....\n\nWhen we requested silverware for the table. Our waitress blamed it on the hostess. Yes, theHostess should have provided silverware.. However It was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck. As a Patron I could care less who's fault it is; just $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away from my pfc experience.\n\nMy Hot and sour soup is usally served with\""noodley\"" things that I drop in the soup. We weren't given any \""noodley \"" things . Not trying to be a jerk but all things being equal the pfc isn't selling food as much as they are selling an experience. This experience is what sets this restaurant apart."
"1","Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \n\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\n\nI ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.\n\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total."
"2","I've always liked PF Chang's and, generally speaking, this location is pretty good. I typically opt to sit at the bar, where the service has always been extremely personable and fast.\n\nThe food is typical PF Chang's: delicious. As one of the chains that provides their nutritional information, it's also nice to know that I can go there and eat somewhat healthy (I'm all about the orange peel shrimp and steamed shrimp dumplings). While some complain about the portion sizes being too small, I've always felt like they were perfect. I do understand how someone looking at a $15 plate of \""Chinese\"" food could wonder why he or she is paying more for less than your standard Chinese restaurant, but it's never bothered me. Most of the meals are consistently good, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Plus, the sauce that your waiter/waitress makes for you is always a nice addition to any meal. I've tried most of the apps, soups, and quite a few of their entr\u00e9es and have never been disappointed.\n\nI've only had one negative experience at this location in the countless times that I've gone, and it revolved around service in the main dining area. I was there for lunch, and the waitress essentially disappeared. I'm not sure if she had been fired, quit, or what, but she took the order and was never seen again. After sitting there for what seemed like an eternity with empty drinks, etc., I finally had to ask if someone else was going to be our server. I had never experienced something like that, but I received free food vouchers for a future visit, and luckily I wasn't in a rush that day, so it worked out. The experience would've made me give the location a worse rating, but one bad experience hasn't outweighed the countless positives: good meals, solid service (especially at the bar), and great takeout service for large orders and smaller ones.\n\nThe only other knock on this location - and it applies to every PF Chang's I've been to - is the insane wait that you'll encounter at dinner time. My wife and I would actually go there more often if we didn't have to wait forever for a table. I love PF Chang's, but I hate waiting more. If you live close enough, get curbside pick-up, or just find somewhere else. I've yet to meet a restaurant worth a 2-hour wait. PF Chang's, included."
"1","ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now, i'll be honest this is the only one i've ever been to, so i don't know if they're all the same but every time i'm underwhelmed. i get there, look at their giant selection and get excited. then i get my meal and remember that i've never had anything too great. don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but for how much they charge, they really need to step it up or at least give me a huge portion. just saying..."
"1","If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person, but tonight was an utter disaster!!  We sat at the bar and the female bartender  was miserable. We ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did.  She spent 20 minutes sending text messages and took 3 smoke brakes in one hour while our drinks were empty. We ordered appetizers and they never came out.  She actually brought us our check and we never got our food. By the way we were the only people at the bar.  Finally a bus boy brought us our food after we payed. We payed before our food came because we thought our table was ready. We finally got seated by the windows. Do not sit by the windows because it was very cold. We ordered our dinner and drinks and guess what no drinks. After our food came we asked about our drinks and the waiter said he forgot. Nothing was comped and no manager was available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We will never return. I will give it 2 stars because the food was great, but the employees are absolutely miserably from hostess to waiters to bartenders. Steer clear until changes are made. It's not worth the headache."
"1","Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks were not good. Greasy spring  rolls \n\nBelow par on every way.  No experience needed to work here"
"1","Walked in tonight, Wednesday, at 9:50, the place was empty. Asked for a table, the hostess told us one moment when she finds one for us, then proceeded to walk to a dirty table and clean it!  The phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door. When she hung up the phone she walked back to the table and proceeded to clean it again!!  Didn't say a word to us. Unbelievable!  Will not be back there-- rude hostess!"
"1","I seriously don't know why people love this place so much, the food here is horrible. The rice is never cooked properly.. And it's not even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come here anymore."
"2","Once you go Pei Wei, you never go.... PF Chang's (if you can help it). \n\nPei Wei is Chang's super convenient and cost friendly fast casual eatery that started infiltrating the Detroit market in 2007. Subsequently, that was the last time I stepped into a PF Changs until I recently moved back to Pittsburgh. Going from a Pei Wei to a PF Chang's is like watching paint dry or sitting in rush hour traffic or attending a WNBA game; it's so methodical and time consuming.\n\nOn our last visit to this location we were accidentally sat in a section in which the server had been cut from his/her shift. By the time we flagged down a server and everything was sorted out, we could have been halfway through our meals at Pei Wei.  Add in the wait time for a table, the sauces shtick, and presentation of the check and my head's about to explode. Chang's is more paced for retires and people on dates, not my lifestyle. I get it, it's a me problem.\n\nWith that said, the staff is very nice and helpful at this location (star). \nI can get a beer or alcoholic beverage while I wait (something that's not an option at Pei Wei) (star).\nPlymouth Gin is stocked behind the bar - that's a chain first! (star).\nI found a dish I love not available at Pei Wei - Salt and Pepper Prawns (star). \n\nSo until I get sick of the Prawns or a Pei Wei opens in the Pittsburgh market, I'll continue to go to this location."
"2","We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected, getting a table near the edge of the restaurant provides for a much nicer dining experience. Our service was good and they accommodated our 1 year old nicely. I appreciate that they serve steamed veggies on the kids menu. \n\nI still left with the impression that the serving sizes were small in comparison to most other places, but we were satisfied and happy."
"2","Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and it was so yummy! Started out with chicken lettuce wraps and it was totally hitting the hungry spot! Lol. Tried chicken lettuce wrap at my places but this place is one of my fave. Their wonton shop is also full of chicken chunks and shrimps as well... which is different bc you don't normally get all that in a wonton soup bowl.  By the time we ate the lettuce wraps and our soups, we were almost full. LOVE the way their Mongolian beef is made here and my friend had the crispy honey shrimp and it was so yummy as well. Definitely will be back because this place is clean, service is quick, food is delicious, and the price isn't so bad either."
"1","We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated, we ordered calamari for appetizer which came with a horrible strange salty sauce and salt and pepper mix on the side. then I ordered beef and broccoli and my husband ordered a vegetarian dish with peanut sauce . After a long wait my food came so salty that I could not even eat and as much as I hate to complain but I had to let the waiter know, so he went to get me one with less salt. My husband's dish was OK. then the second one was a bit less salty but the meat had a terrible liver kind of taste which totally turned my stomach. I feel the reason they added so much salt was to hide the bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter was kind and sympathetic. ruined my evening out :("
"1","Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.\n\nSo... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.\n\nI started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think?) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \""pork\""-filled wontons. As I said, the broth had decent flavor, but the wontons were thick, doughy and under-cooked, and the chicken chunks were dry, which is amazing since they were drowned in broth! On a scale of bad to good, it was kind of meh.\n\nNext came my \""lunch-portion\"" order of Chang's Kung Pao Chicken (the dinner portion is $5 more). \n\nAt the New Dumpling House, this dish is served with a delectable dark, rich, tangy sauce, which I was really hoping for... Not at PF Chang's. \n\nOn my plate I received about 8 quarter-size chunks of lightly breaded and browned chicken, 7 hot Chinese red chili peppers (mostly inedible unless they are diced into a sauce), a handful of blanched, unsalted peanuts, a few sliced scallions, and a bed of the most bland brown rice I have ever encountered. Uncle Ben would've been ashamed if that stuff came out of one of his boxes.\n\nGlaringly, there was NO SAUCE!. None at all.\n\nI've had Kung Pao Chicken in New York City, San Francisco, and even from a hole in the wall in Bethel Park, PA that was much, much better. Never have I had it served in such a bland, skimpy, and overpriced way! The \""lunch-portion\"" cost was $9.95.\n\nAt The New Dumpling House, I could have a delicious lunch, with soup, entree and complimentary hot tea, and I could leave satisfied with just $8 out-of-pocket -- and that includes the tip.\n\nThe service was decent. However, lesson learned. One and done. Never going back to PF Changs."
"2","Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.  Our favorite manager is Joe and favorite server is Kevin.  Call ahead if you have any questions and they will answer your questions."
"1","I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all."
"2","It's the same Panera food you've had before.  I like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one.  That said the food is fine and the staff is nice enough.\n\nThey have warm cookies for $2.00.  That is a nice feature."
"1","Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing."
"1","The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. \n\nThe service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch, but ended horribly when my daughter said we should get a treat for my husband. \n\nBetween being ignored by the girl at the counter, her not listening to the order, then arguing with me when I told her I did not ask for what she brought me, I really can't decide which is worse. I rather spend my money somewhere local where they appreciate my business, rather than take attitude from Panera employees."
"2","This use to be my go to Panera Bread.  When I worked in the area I would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.  I was happy when I left the area and moved on to bigger and better things.  My waist also appreciated it.  Those scones are delicious.\n\nI recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread.  Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted.  They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.  But it is much better tasting."
"1","The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  The vet checked the ears, teeth, and nails then called it a day.  \n\nI came home looked at his teeth and saw my pup had a \""slab fracture\""  which was still attached to the gum.  The vet didn't mentioned it during the \""exam\"" other than telling me to buy a finger brush to brush his teeth.\n\nI was primarily there for a vaccination shot but if they're going to charge me for a examination, they should do a proper examination.  I just felt I was rushed out of there. \n\nI took my dog to another vet where they told me about the slab fracture, gave me info on how it usually happens, potential problems that it can cause, and recommendations on ways to fix the problem."
"2","After working for the rival of Target for years, Target has become my favorite mega chain store to shop at.  Although it does not seem to have every single item as other stores I'm still able to get in and get out in a hurry.  \n\nDepending on the time of day, it may be a task just to find a parking space due to the traffic light at the end of the road.  If you don't mind walking a bit, the aisle where the pharmacy sign is on the building usually has spots closer to the front of the store.\n\nThe only downside I can find for this location is the smell of overly burnt buttered popcorn as soon as you walk in due to the cafe location.  I prefer not to vomit as soon as I walk into a store, maybe after about ten minutes in I'd consider it."
"2","Target is pretty standard. If you've been to one of them, you'll know largely what to expect from this one. That being said, this store is clean, and the deals one clearance can be good. Just make sure to check the circular and the website, as sometimes additional coupons can be found that the store personnel aren't aware of. \n\nThe electronics department staff are not very knowledgeable, and tried to pressure me into buying a different TV by repeating marketing lingo, but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them, so make sure to do your research beforehand if purchasing electronics."
"2","Target is one of my favorite stores -- I just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet -- it's just so therapeutic! This location is now my closest store, so I drop by pretty often.\n\nThis store is pretty average. Inventory and customer service aren't particularly stellar but isn't poor either. I've generally been able to find what I need here and check out pretty quickly. \n\nIn addition to the common pharmacy and photo studio found in most Targets, this location also has an optical department. Of the 10-15 locations in the Pittsburgh area, only this store and the Cranberry store sell glasses. I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses through Target Optical three years ago and have been very happy with their product and customer service."
"2","I've been to many Targets and they're all the same. However, this particular one is currently being remodeled. Children's clothing, toys, electronics and health & beauty items have been moved to other parts of the store. There is a new Starbucks that is now open. The cafe that is there has been remodeled and will serve Pizza Hut pizza and other new menu items. The area where the electronics used to be it is now going to have a small grocery section. Basically, this Target in Homestead will eventually look like the one in East Liberty. I like this Target, so I am pleased with the new changes (especially Starbucks)!"
"1","Watch out when it looks like something is on sale.  They mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or 50% off sign, then only some of the stuff on the rack is on sale."
"1","Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.\n3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \""Oh... I don't know\"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \""Let me check that for you\"") he instead said \""Well, I'm going to hang up now.\""  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.\n7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \""I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\"" to which she responded \""Yeah that should be fine\"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.\n8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \""Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\"" \n10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.\n\nOver my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \""Effing Men's Wearhouse.\""  For example, at a restaurant, \""Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\""  \""Noise complaint at the hotel room? Men's Wearhouse.\""\n\nAnother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \""I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\"" to which I replied \""Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\""\n\nCongrats Men's Wearhouse.  You became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\nTL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to Jos. A. Bank."
"1","It's not that delish."
"1","This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money, shop elsewhere."
"2","We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees, Chris, walked around with us to help us pick out exactly what we needed. The wedding registry coordinator, Christina, was also very helpful and accommodating. They treated us as if we were royalty. I would recommend this wedding registry without a doubt!"
"2","This is a very small, yet nice store. The associates are nice and helpful. Not much else to say about this particular store. Just a pleasure to purchase from..."
"1","Much like every other Eat 'n Park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food), except the last five times I've been here, the service has been damn, damn, daaaaaaaamn slow.  It's always fun to see the staff smoking out back while I've waited an hour for some scrambled eggs."
"1","The food is usually pretty good, however the service is almost ALWAYS very VERY slow. Most of the staff are pretty friendly and sweet but there are a few sour ones in the bunch that make the experience not as nice as it could be. Although they still technically do their job, you can FEEL very negative vibes from them and see how inefficient they are with the way they do things. It's a hit and miss. Unless you know one of the servers and their schedules. The low rating is mainly for the slow service and the handful of staff members who aren't very pleasant."
"1","Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously, we never wait less than 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, and we live near the Waterfront, so we've given this location the benefit of the doubt numerous times.  Each time hoping that the last was just a fluke, new staff, or something.  It's not.  Doesn't matter what time we go.  It seems we are not acknowledged for several minutes, and then the service is mediocre at best.  Occasionally, we've had a stellar service, but it's few and far between.  Today, after waiting 15 minutes, then getting up to find a server in another section, we were informed that we were sitting in a \""closed\"" section.  That server offered to serve us, but honestly, we left.  I told the hostess who seated us about the mixup, and got a blank stare.  I've never had this issue at any other EnP.  We left, drove to the Squirrel Hill location, and our orders were taken in the amount of time we wasted at the Waterfront.  Mgmt- you have a beautiful, prime location.  Get your hosts and servers on the same page!"
"1","God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish, except maybe the cheesteak. Only go if u have little kids"
"2","I enjoy this TJ Maxx location. I'm not sure that any TJ Maxx in Western PA has as good of a selection as the Johnstown TJ Maxx, (yes, that's right, I really did say Johnstown) but this one is pretty close. There is plenty of space, and there is a decent homegoods section as well. Not huge, but decent.\n\nThis location always has a few Bliss products, which makes it top notch in my opinion. I mean, where else can you get discounted Bliss products??\n\nI generally don't have a lot of success with shoes at TJ Maxx because they never seem that discounted to me, but I have struck gold at this location several times. Last summer I scored two pairs of Cole Haan wedges for under $40 at the beginning of summer, and I've had success with booties here as well. Great deals on shoes makes me a happy girl!\n\nAll in all, this is a great location, and one that I frequent at least a few times per month."
"2","Decent size, decent selection, decent staff.\n\nI guess that can wholly sum this place up, it's decent.  As with many other stores that are like this, the product rotates depending on what doesn't sale well at other stores.  Can always snag a deal here.  I was able to pick up a pretty sweet Puma jacket for $10, can't beat that, right?\n\nThat being said, there are those times that you may not find anything as well.  So really don't get your hopes up if you are looking for a specific item."
"1","Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company, I make sure to stop by both locations when shopping at the Waterfront. I generally find nothing or spend only $10 or so at Marshalls, while being enticed to spend at least $50-100 at TJ Maxx. The Waterfront TJ Maxx seems to have not only the same product as this Marshalls plus a whole lot more. All that to say, I consider shopping here a waste of time since I could just drive a block or so and be at a store owned by the same company that always has what I want and need. Sorry, Marshalls, but you're just OK to me."
"2","This is one of the few restaurants I frequent in the Waterfront. Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner."
"2","Mtchells is one of the best fish places around.  I really like their Shanghi preparation of my fish. It's just delicious.\n\nThe establishment is always clean, the staff courteous and the fish, of course, fresh.  \n\nOddly enough one of my favorite things about going here besides the fish is the bread they give you.  It's always so warm and tasty.\n\nThe deserts are also very tasty.  I have gotten two that I really liked\n\nThey also have a three course fixed price option last I went that was a great value. I think it was $20/person for lunch."
"2","An excellent choice for fresh, well prepared seafood located in the Waterfront area in Homestead.   I frequent this area for business travel, and you can't do much better without heading downtown.\n\nThe seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef's specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious, and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.\n\nThere is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  The deserts are adequate, though not a highlight.  \n\nIf you're on the Waterfront, you won't do better than this.  Enjoy!"
"2","This place has great seafood. The best in the area. I come here for seafood every time. Everything on their menu is good. Their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. Appetizers are amazing like the raw oysters.  Their clam chowder is the best. Really creamy with lots of clams. Wonderful restaurant. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. We love coming to this restaurant. Don't forget a reservation on weekends. You will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. We never get to the dessert. Always too full to eat dessert.   Forgot to take pictures."
"2","Excellent service, great meal!  They had an excellent selection of seafood,  and I can't wait to dine again"
"2","We went here for Valentines Day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else. We both loved it. The calamari is outstanding and if you get there before 7, they run happy hour which is half off apps and $3 beers. \n\nI had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and the crabcake was a good size. Atmosphere was good and busy but that is likely because of it being Valentines day. Despite the busyness, the wait staff was very attentive.\n\nMy wife's steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect medium level. We will def be back."
"2","Went on a Saturday, 2 hour wait. food is good, I got some seafood gumbo to go and I won't do that again. Seemed like it didn't have any seafood in it."
"2","Service was slow, but that was because one of our party insisted that the bartender, her favorite server, serve us in our private room for a party of 8.  The food and drinks were good and we woud return."
"1","I am bummed about this- I had high hopes. Here's a rundown of the evening:\n\nPros:\n- super friendly waitress, Stephanie, who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout \n- yummy elderflower and pear beverage\n- lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y\n- hot delicious bread\n\nCons:\n- oysters were sketch. And I don't feel good about that. Stephanie brought us an order of East Coast oysters to replace the West Coast ones that we sent back.\n- fresh grated horseradish had NO flavor or heat- what's up with that?\n- scallops were meh- came with weird veggies, unevenly seared, and no real flavor. And at a whopping $25 a plate, I expect some nummers!\n\nI doubt we'll go back- for those prices, I would prefer McCormick's or Ruth's Chris."
"1","Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything."
"1","I'm not a mean reviewer, if you look at the other places I've reviewed, but this was just so so so disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin was very poorly done. The meat was extremely bland, with very little seasoning. I have a very low sodium tolerance and yet I still found this fish to be made too bland. The rice was entirely uncooked and it made crunching sounds as I took my first bite. I talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side. It wasn't the same. The whole dish was a fail and I don't think I am ever coming back again :("
"1","I went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in West Homestead, so I decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.   \n\nI was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.    \n\nAfter announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.\n\nThen I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .\""it's TAKEOUT\""  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.\n\nGentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)\n\nAfter more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.\n\nWhen i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with. \n\nVERY DISAPPOINTING experience.   Will not be returning."
"1","Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks, they knocked the Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta the park.  The ambiance is very nice.  Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \""bad where I hope they improve.\""  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.  \n\nSeared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)  \n\nBBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \""must-miss\"".  \n\nCod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice."
"1","I have always had a great dinner at Mitchell's but something has changed. Went there last night about 5:30, the place was maybe half full. We were seated and when it finally occurred to us that no one had been to the table at all to ask about drinks or even bring water, I started timing.... 14 minutes later we decided to leave. Told the hostess what had happened and got a blank stare.  Sorry but not going back there again."
"1","The service was mostly friendly but I was disappointed in my meal. My meal was way over cooked. The soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and I felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones.  Overall, I thought it was mediocre and I was expecting more for the prices."
"1","Food was only ok. Had lobster bisque soup not to good. Had the shang Hai Seafood Sampler. The scallops were hard, over cooked. The samon was good. Shrimp had no flavor. I will say the service was the best. Our waiter was great!!"
"2","Love this place - they were very accommodating to me, Peanut and Gramma (she goes often).  Solid wine selection and Gramma says they make a good Margarita.  We all enjoyed all of our food as well.  Great view of the Mon too."
"2","Love this place so much. The food is always so delicious always leave feeling extremely satisfied. The service is incredibly slow though, takes FOREVER to our meals! Even during lunch time when there's almost no one there.. I don't understand I always end up eating here for at LEAST two-four hours. Fish is always fresh, lobster is delicate and tasty, and surprisingly the steak is amazing as well. Clam chowder is rich and creamy-- perfect thickness! Love their salads as well. Definitely recommend this place for a date night :) pricey? Definitely, be prepared to spend at least $20/person!"
"2","First I would like to say that I was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me to made terribly ill. \nThat being said, I came here and was delighted by my server Michael who was not only friendly but incredibly attentive and very sharp. \nI originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. Hence, the tuna. \nNow the tuna was amazing. Seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact. \nI would most definitely come back again and if I lived in the area, this would be one of my top spots."
"2","I love Mitchell's Fish Market.  95% of the time, the food is amazing but, when they mess up, they move heaven and earth to make it better.  The last time we were at Mitchell's, I ordered the lobster and tenderloin skewers.  My lobster was underdone.  The server was amazing and replaced the lobster tail even though I had eaten most of it.  Then, to make our night even better, comped us a dessert.  It's that kind of stellar service that keeps us going back."
"2","This was my first time at this location.  I've frequented the Upper St Clair Galleria restaurant.  There's a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain.  I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.  \n\nThe staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.  \n\nWe were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.  It's a tough thing to do.  It wasn't perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh.  Nicely done."
"2","In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.\nBroiled scallops were very good, partner had sea bass stuffed with lobster, also very good. Vegetable sides were not as good as the fish. With two glasses of wine the total was $83. In and out in an hour.\nI'd go back because the fish was that good"
"2","I love old navy clothing, it's vintage styling with good prices. Great jeans too, I love the painter's jeans."
"1","After further consideration, this store does not deserve a 4 star review. The Old Navy product has been pretty weak recently, which isn't the store's fault, but the severe lack of customer service doesn't help the situation. \n\nWhile shopping here on Friday, I was one of maybe 3-5 people in the store. I would practically walk into a sales associate but not even receive a glance or smile. No one working here seems to give an iota whether or not product is being sold. To avoid inconveniencing the associates, I will be taking my Old Navy purchases online in the future."
"1","I don't see to many options in Pittsburgh for sporting goods. Dick's seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products."
"1","I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player, runner, and sports fan, so my reviews will always be skewed towards those particular areas. With that said, this is probably the worst Dick's location that I've ever been to. The selection is very limited for soccer gear, which must be a testament to the lack of the local customer base seeking out soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, which makes it nearly useless to adults or even some teenage soccer players.\n\nThe staff at this location has always been really nice, though, and it's the closest location to where we live, so I still end up going there quite a bit for running and clothing needs (of course, we usually leave empty-handed as they don't have what we're looking for). \n\nThey do have quite an extensive fan gear section if you're looking to support the local Pittsburgh teams, but this store just doesn't have the overall inventory necessary to be considered a \""good\"" Dick's location."
"1","A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you."
"1","By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter, to get your order correct.  Ninety percent of the time you receive the wrong order, after waiting what seems an eternity.  I've even enjoyed the experience of going through the drive thru, only to get home and find no beef patties on my Big Mac.  Save yourself the aggravation, and do not go here."
"1","You know it's bad when a McDonald's gets a 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none of us expect anything fancy when we go to a McDonald's. The whole point of going to McDonald's is indulging in some not-good-for-you food on the go in your busy life. In my case, I just wanted a small meal/snack that wouldn't cost me as much as the stuff in Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten at a McDonald's in about eight years or so. And I quickly remembered why!\n\nForget the fact that McDonald's food isn't great. We all know it's not great. The problem here is that they added insult to injury by giving you the worst customer service ever in addition to not so good food. For starters, I quickly discovered that the drive-thru here is the ABSOLUTE slowest line on planet Earth. You certainly won't be getting any fast food here! Then, once I FINALLY placed my order, and finally got to the window to pay (because of course I spent a lot of time waiting for the people in front of me to even get their orders), a young woman took my card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\n\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it."
"1","By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in the\nWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that, after your long wait in the drive thru, your order will most definitely be wrong.  Calls to the owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises own a majority of the McDonalds in the South Hills.  They have all gone down hill in quality, service and cleanliness.  The owner has to be the problem."
"2","Good pizza at a great price. The unique crust that's both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody, but our whole group liked it. The sauce is good too, light but with a good tomato flavor. \n\nThe best thing about this place is the management. They went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast. And the prices: we fed everybody in under $40, with plenty of leftovers taken home."
"1","Bought a bike there on my second time in the shop.   Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming, annoying and pushy, I can see how he can be very helpful to the average Joe, but if you are in his shop you should have done your homework, as this place is not walmart, mid to high level product here. I would encourage getting fitted and even buying a bike there, but going back for service is a whole different story.  Same day service is unheard of here, even for the simplest of adjustments, no service is available at all on the weekends.  the first time I took a bike there to have a rear derailer hanger replaced and re-adjusted (I had already purchased and had the hanger) 11 days went by before I returned to pick my bike up after not being called.  I figured it was just a fluke experience and gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The second time. I took a bike in to have a damaged shift lever replaced with a new 7800 pair. I called after 9 days and they said it wold be 2 days more.  when I showed up 2 days later it still wasn't done, it took 2 more following that, 13 days total.  Stay away from their service department"
"2","Great customer service!!!"
"2","This place is the absolute BEST to purchase a bike! I have been searching for a bike for a while now and every place I have gone to have not been NEAR has helpful as Glenn. \nThe one guy in the shop helped pick me a bike for what I needed and Glenn fit me perfectly to the bike. They also helped me with the bike rack on my car and changed my bike saddle for me! Ohhhh and they gave me the best price on the bike and accessories!!!  Wonderful service. Absolutely will go back! ... Can't wait!"
"2","If you're in the market for a high quality bike, whether it be road, mountain, racing, or hybrid, go to see Glenn at BBB.  It's very clear that he loves his shop and his job.  I explained my needs and preferences to him and he quickly fitted me with a bike that suited my needs.   I actually bought my Trek 7300 over 3 years ago and I absolutely love it!  He sells only the highest quality bikes and equipment.  Highly recommended."
"2","This place makes AWESOME pizza. Also, their Italian hoagies are great. The only problem is that they do not open until 4."
"1","Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne, PA which is outside of Pittsburgh from Harrisburg, PA of all places. Where I am at, really there is no delivery but these guys did. They were nice and cordial and cheap but I have been spoiled by the pizza shop in Harrisburg, Downtown, run my an old world Italian guy named Luigi. That pizza is/was MILES better than this. This crust, while thin, did not have flavor and was hard. The slices were small for their 8 slice which I did like. The cheese was good. The sauce was meh. I've definitely had way better. 2 stars for being cheap and delivering."
"1","Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there, it's really good. When they aren't, you get pizza that is over cooked (more like burnt) and LONG delivery times. The pizza, even when plain, is very greasy. Way more than other places around. Usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese. Also they do not take credit or debit cards. There are better options."
"2","Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate, extra chewy and humongous.  Delicious.\n\nAnd a sweet old lady serving em up.\n\nThe best.\n\nDelicious."
"2","Years after the first reviewer came here, the quality is still great and deserving of more than 5 stars.\n\nThe people who work here and run this place are super friendly and really know their craft. The main owner took my order once and gave me some tips on how to cook the frozen pierogies at home. They turned out ok, but not as good as getting them fresh from the store. \n\nIt can be a bit of a drive from anywhere that's not McKees Rocks (Google Maps takes you through the hood) but it's worth it."
"2","These pierogies are one of my favorite things in the world. They're freakin' amazing. The potato and jalapeno ones are my favorite. And I definitely think it's worth it to drive all the way out to McKees Rocks to get them. I like to get them frozen, and bring them home and smother them in butter."
"1","Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back"
"2","Update: Get. The. Italian. Sausage. Pierogies. Holy crap. It will change your freaking life!"
"2","Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!"
"1","The experience was not that great. The lady taking the orders was nice, but not helpful with what to order. The owner kept her back turn to us the entire time, based on the pictures and news articles I read about her I thought she would have been more social. To what really matters we got #2 sampler and order of jalape\u00f1o pierogies and the Ruben pierogies a lot of food for two guys. Really had no idea what to expect. Haluski was good, the pierogies came Luke warm and soaked in oily butter. Like the cab driver said you can find better. I'd pass on this spot."
"1","I was very disappointed in the quality of the pierogies and the haluski at Pierogies Plus.  I ordered them hot and I purchased enough so that I could have leftovers the next day.  When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as 'butter sauce' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain't no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can't measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter."
"2","Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!"
"2","Marges is tucked away in the delightful Pittsburgh neighborhood of Mckees Rocks. This place reminds me half of a diner from the 1950's, and half my grandmas kitchen.\n\nThe seating room is accommodation, the service prompt and courteous.The prices are fantastic and so is the food.\n\nI had a grilled hodge podge combination of hot/sweet sausage, potatoes, eggs, and peppers all on one dish for 9.50. It was excellent. Ladies and Gents, I can put food away  like a champ and I still had leftovers.\n\nMy friend had a succulent, buttery French Toast. Simple, but they nailed it.\n\nI would return."
"2","Great service, great food at a reasonable price!  The cheeseburger was as big as my head and delicious and the onion rings were just as good.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and quick to refill drinks. Can't wait to go back!"
"2","Great small town breakfast spot Highly recommend George's Mixed Grill ... Delicious"
"1","They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person, but being rude twice means you dont want my business and I tipped 20%."
"2","Got my first tattoo here in 1993 and my second a couple weeks later. All these \nYears later they still look great. Haven't faded much and haven't\nHad em touched up. The shop is Professional and clean, I highly \nRecommend. Excellent quality work."
"1","ewwww"
"1","It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood, but you could have been fooled by how long the food took.  While it did take a while everyone was extremely friendly.  The food did come out hot, at least mine did, the rest of the plates were plate-warmer hot.  Everyone in the table resented me for \""holding back\"" the table since they staff pointed out they were waiting on my burger.\n\nWhich hey works as a segway onto the burger.  Quesadilla Burger.  I knew that was a mistake but I did it anyways.  The patty was sorta flavorful.  The toppings were in the bland category.  Cheese went MIA.  And the tortilla were over-toasted and tasteless.\n\nA big blah overall, which is sad, since we've had a grand ole time and good food in past visits."
"1","Called for an arrangement for pickup, told the person who took my order that I would be able to pick the arrangement up at 5:30pm.  She asked if I could get there any earlier, I said I would try my best, but I work until 5pm, so maybe not.  She said ok.  \n\nComes to be 5pm and I get a call from a guy at the shop asking where I was!  The lady who took my order wrote down that I'd be there at 5pm.  I explained that I never said that and picked the arrangement up a little before 5:30pm.  \n\nArrangement was just OK.  I specifically wanted a lot of orange flowers, which they did, but they added strange colors with the orange... and some of the flowers were already a little wilted.  \n\nEven though the location is convenient, I will probably go elsewhere for a flower order next time."
"2","i had a fantastic experience here. I got to the shop just before they weer about to close, but the owner was very gracious about creating an arrangement for me. The flowers were lovely. I would make a special trip just to purchase from this shop again."
"1","The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. \n\nI will not order from this place again."
"1","Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \""I taste like iodine\"" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive)."
"2","Excellent pizza - although the mushrooms were from a can. But the crust , sauce and rest of toppings on the Sicilian pizza were delicious. Nice family friendly"
"2","Service was very good..calzone was excellent."
"2","Best pizza in the North Boros.  I can't make a trip to the area without stopping at Luigi's.  When I was a kid, the man himself actually owned the place and made the pizza, but they've since moved to a new location under new ownership...but the pizza is still just as good.  I prefer the thin-crust, but the Sicilian is also excellent.  The fried zucchini is a favorite and the mozzarella sticks are great, too.  The calzones are tasty, but may cause a coronary-- if you expect more than a handful of spinach among cheese in the spinach calzone, you'll be disappointed.  Because it's Pittsburgh, the chicken salad comes with french fries.  I tend to opt for take-out, but there is also a mid-sized dining section."
"2","I have been eating at Luigi's since before birth (my mom loves this stuff). The new location is nice, but I miss the coziness of the old place. \nThe food has been consistent through the transition, which happened a long while ago by the way. Also, I have read a few other reviews that said Luigi's has left but I talk with him every time I am in. Regardless this is a great family owned pizzeria and I recommend the calzone because it is generously stuffed with ricotta :)."
"1","I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Luigi's was one of them.  I have driven by Luigi's many times before and for some reason had never stopped in but that did allow it to come to mind whenever I was looking for a pizza place I had not yet tried in the Bellevue area.  Whenever I called to place my order I was told that my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes.  I arrived closer to 30 minutes later and was immediately confused whenever I walked into the restaurant.  You see there was a large dining room on the left that was full of people and I didn't immediately see the are where I would get my pizza from.  Finally after a few steps into the restaurant I noticed that the whole back area of the restaurant was where I needed to be and I made my way back there.  My pizza was ready for me and I quickly paid and was leaving whenever the cashier told me \""Stay out of trouble\"".  I really hope that was a friendly sentiment and not one that was based upon my appearance or anything else.  The pizza itself had a medium thick crust with a bland sauce which is weird since I could see a ton of green herbs in it.  The cheese was just ok and nothing special while the pizza itself had a slightly sour taste to it which I did not enjoy.  Out of the three different pizzas we ate that night this one was overwhelmingly our least favorite which was evidenced by the fact that 3/4 of it was left after the evening.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not head back to Luigi's in the future.  I just don't see myself making a trip to Luigi's between the weird experience (although not bad) that I had in the restaurant and the fact that there are much better pizza places nearby."
"2","Just ordered delivery from here. The soup was very good. I also would Recommend the specialty salad. I also was surprised at how quickly the order was delivered. It was delivered within a 1/2 an hour."
"2","This place has great tasting food. I had a italian hoagie and it was great. The pizza is top notch."
"1","I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald's. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it is never, ever right. It is never quick. The staff is always rude. After trying at least 12-15 times over the past year, I've finally given up hope on this place. Do not recommend."
"1","Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork, everything tastes off--like it's been overcooked in mop-bucket-water.  Try House of Lee instead."
"2","Whether you live in Ben Avon Heights, Brighton Heights - or anywhere in between - I urge you to try China Sea.  It is quite simply the best local Chinese delivery.  The people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  The delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes, yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  Some favorites of ours are the Kung Pao shrimp, pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I don't mean to compare China Sea to the higher end Chinese restaurants in our area.  It is not Sesame Inn or China Palace; it is not a \""date night out\"" sort of place. It most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality \""stay in and relax\"" go to.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!\n\nps\nA few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes.\npps\nAlways look at their online coupons, you will get something free!"
"1","The pros:\nYou get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent, this would have been even better because... LEFTOVERS. \nThey have coupons on their website that you can use whenever. \n\n\nThe cons:\nThe woman who answers the phone is kinda rude. You try to ask her questions and she gets an attitude with you like you're wasting her time. \nMy pork dumplings were \""fried\"" only on one side and were raw in the middle. \nEverything was pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends to be a little salty, but this was unacceptably salty. \nLeftovers... Yes this is also a con because I threw it away. Suffering through it once was enough! \n\nIf you're craving something made fresh that is spicy and sweet, you're not going to find it here. Just very greasy, very salty, poor excuse for Chinese takeout."
"1","If you have any common sense at all, please don't stay here.  Once, it almost burnt down...and I'm pretty sure most of the locals were chanting \""burn, baby, burn.\"""
"1","Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty, just absolutely rank."
"1","OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls, and squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, so not the best, but for two hours, we could deal. We looked for bed bugs, and didn't see any immediate signs of them- so we laid down to rest. After about 20-30 minutes, we both started itching like crazy. I ran to the bathroom mirror (there was mold all over the bathroom) and saw bed bug bites all on my shoulders, arms, and legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut them down! It's deplorable in there!!"
"1","I can't even rate this place! Its absolutely disgusting! I begged the health department to shut them down! I was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting! I woke up with bed bug bites all over my body! Just filthy! DO NOT STAY HERE!"
"2","Fair prices but good quality... And amazing designs that are custom made.... Plus gel and solar nails are available for those interested... Offers waxing services... Completely renovated and the spa pedicure chair is amazing..."
"1","My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving, and claimed to be in dire need of a manicure. I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time."
"1","I got a pedicure here. Not bad, they were pretty thorough. But two days later both of my big toes were infected and oozing pus where she trimmed my toenails on the sides (which was weird anyway). I hate to rate a local shop down, but man my toes hurt."
"2","My boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. There are photographs of the owners and chefs family on the walls.... its cute. My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  There is no set menu and the waitress reads out what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty interesting . They are also very generous with the bread which i LOVED!!!!\nEvery meal was made to perfection. It had a homey feeling .....\nMy boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  My entree was spaghetti squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. The service was great.\n All in all it was an amazing experience. The chef came out to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off my dinner with the creme brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely worth it .\nThis is a great restaurant for a super special occasions and  it is very private.Not to dressy and not too casual.\n Pick out a great bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.\n Im pretty sure my boyfriend and i will be going back."
"2","Yes!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\nGreat service!\nGreat Food!\nLove the BYOB!!! ($5)."
"1","STAY AWAY, the owners are so rude, they blatantly say they are not doing well and then try to pretend they have the best hairdressers in Pittsburgh. they make you feel so unwelcome, advertise they offer a bunch of services and then when you ask they snap at you that they only do hair.  it was so awkward and weird .  i received warnings not to get my hair done there so i was going to get a pedicure because i had a gift certificate.  she told me her employees will only take cash if they have to touch a client's feet.  I may go there just to get bangs trimmed since i do not want to completely waste the certificate, but this place gives me the creeps, sounds dirty, and has beyond bad customer service.  They definitely do NOT know how to run a business and it is obvious why they are not doing well. Sue and Kristi pass the phone back and forth because noone wants to take a call.  she reiterates that the business is doing bad and they need more clients.  i have never experienced a ruder salon, or should i say dead beat shack."
"1","I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \""Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!"
"1","Now I'm picky about my hair, but Mane Attractions was so bad that I walked out after about 15 minutes of watching the stylists work on other clients.\n\nI had desperately needed a haircut and walked in for a major trim and re-shaping of my layers.  First, the girl at the counter said my hair might be \""difficult\"" due to the length (it was nearly long enough to sit on at the time) and that I would probably have to stand while it was cut.  Weird, but okay.  Second, no one there knew anything about donating to \""Locks of Love,\"" and I feel like salons should be aware of things like that.  I needed a cut so I went for it anyway.\n\nI watched the two stylists while I waited for my turn.  One stylist told the client whose hair she was cutting that she was going to do something other than what they discussed because it \""wasn't looking right.\""  Ummm, okay.  The other stylist was too busy checking her phone every three seconds to notice she was yanking on her client's hair so hard with the comb that she was giving her poor client whiplash.\n\nAt that point, I just pretended like I had received an urgent text and said, \""I have to leave, so sorry \""as I bolted for the door."
"2","Let me just tell you, I have really, really difficult hair.  type 3b Naturally curly, 100% grey, I dye it dark and mess with the color myself. ( never good)  If you want to know where to get a good haircut you ask someone with my hair. Since I have been going to Mane Attractions I have really LOVED my hair. I have been going there for about 4 years. Kristi was even able to cut my curly hair into a short reverse bob without making me look like i was wearing a helmet. ( you curly girls know what I am talking about). I have had nothing but complements on my hair and even my mom( who is always honest) is impressed. The only complaint I ever have is that yes, sometimes I have gone there on the spur of the moment and it has been closed during the week. I just know to call and schedule things. it is a small business and I get it.  P.S. kids haircuts are only 10$ and My daughter loves it."
"2","My daughter CAN'T pass by here without asking to get something.  All I can say is you had better bring your sweet tooth!"
"1","Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick, crust was not even crunchy or had taste, and the key lime was weak. Pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or 2."
"1","Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep."
"2","Without question, this is my favorite thrift store in the greater Pittsburgh region. I find antique kitchenwares here that are older than my grandma, worth $85 if the antique mall is to be believed, and priced at $2.50. The 50%-off sales actually pay off here. The merchandise turns over quickly. The staff is a real cast of characters (don't miss the steelers tattoos!!! i'm seriously serious, they are amazing). there are bicycles for you and your kids in decent-semi-working condition. The balance of stuff is about half and half valuable old vintage and more modern hand-me-downs. The prices are reasonable to cheap. The plastic bags on the wall are often a treasure trove. The kitchen section could outfit your kitchen in fondue pots for days. Most thrift store remodels result in ridiculous high prices to pay for the construction. The remodel here just means a bigger, cleaner store and parking lot. \n\nI have spent, cumulatively, probably  several weeks of my life in this store. This is, hands-down, without question, the thing I miss most about leaving Pittsburgh. This store is the largest single contributor to my wardrobe, outside of H&M."
"1","So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca, and I will get to how I left empty handed and in tears.  First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money."
"1","I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable, and there are no fitting rooms!  One purchases clothes at their own risk!  What person would buy a suit under these conditions, hoping the pants will fit?  Unlike other stores, there is no senior discount and no credit cards accepted, a rare cash only business.  To the reviewer who boasts that everything is 50% off every day, how is that a sale?  It is bogus pricing.  Red White and Blue, uggh!"
"1","Love the store. Great stuff, High price. Buyer BEWARE of the RUDE cashier SYLVIA, extremely unpleasant, unwilling to help and always with NEGATIVE attitude. She needs customer service training....Someone please tell her to stop complaining about other customers or employees....Cashier that does window display is always kind, friendly and helpful."
"1","Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place."
"2","I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \n\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\n\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. \n\nShopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!\n\nREMINDER: CASH ONLY!!\n-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee"
"2","This is one of the true sleepers of \""neighborhood Pittsburgh.\"" Since 1979, this \""diner/family restaurant\"" has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. The staff has been there as long.\n\nThey have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. They also have my favorite pancakes. If you're looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, I assure you that it will be one of the best \""old time\"" meals you'll ever have. \n\nI hate its name, but I love the Rusty Nail."
"1","The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful, prices are reasonable, the wait staff are gems, and is often bragged about by Bellevue locals.  That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out."
"1","I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds."
"1","Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThey have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.  \n\nWe were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \""Meh, I've experienced better.\""  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again."
"1","I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning."
"2","I had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic. There was also a continuous flow of coffee, which is always nice. Probably just missed the church crowd so it wasn't too busy either. Definitely a good breakfast spot."
"2","Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!"
"2","The food at Joe's Rusty nail is GREAT. As the pictures will show, the servings/portions are plentiful. The service is quick, and the staff personable. I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad)  bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well, tasted great, and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last. As I say I vote with my feet and my USD, and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash, will continue to flow at Joe's and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not!!"
"1","This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times."
"1","First time here and I wasnt impressed at all!  I should have gone to the dairy queen :-("
"2","Sometime ago,I was looking for someone to service my Grandfather clocks in my home. After extensive research,I ran across these folks. I couldn't be happier with the result of their visitation. The knowledge they possess and the professionalism with which they practice,is impeccable! ALL of my clocks are running at peak performance;they even took the time to look at my \""Black Forest\"" cuckoo clocks and passed on valuable advice as to how I should maintain them. I graciously appreciate their time,demeanor,and service! I wish no one else to service my clocks in the future! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE FOLKS! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank-you so much for all that you have done to restore my precious time pieces!"
"2","I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired, which was given to me by my mother who had recently passed away.  I needed it done on a short time line since I live out-of-town and was leaving soon.  It is next to impossible to find anyone who can actually fix that type of clock especially anywhere close to where I live.  They were so accommodating and really really helped me out during a hard time.  Much thanks to Lisa for spending the time to teach my about the clock & how to take care of it and her dad for fixing it up!  My Atmos clock is now working great and looks wonderful on my mantle!"
"2","My beer distributor of choice - and there are others located closer to me.\n\nLet's be clear, it is no frills, cases of beer stacked up, limited cases in the cooler.  Selection is ok - if I were looking for something obscure - I wouldn't count on them having it.\n\nBut they are helpful and efficient.  They have convenient hours and parking**.  Also they helped me out in a keg emergency that saved a party.  Service in a jam earns my loyalty.\n\n**Note - most of their customers have no idea how to park in said parking lot."
"2","Ha! The parking lot is good, and yet nobody can ever park properly or politely! This is a good distributor that is conveniently located, well-stocked, and has friendly staff. It is a little unfortunate that the only cases that are kept in the cooler are the less exotic beers, but their selection is fairly broad, and the space is small, so I won't dwell too much on that. Overall, a decent beer shop, as long as we are shackled to the idea of the distributor here in PA."
"2","In my opinion, this is the best distributor in the city. The people running it are great, the selection is very good, and the prices are competitive with almost any other place I've been to. Because I'm not too picky, I typically have been stopping right at the front to buy the discounted brew that's usually out of season. You can't beat buying a case for $12.99. I'll continue to go here for my beer needs until I leave the city."
"2","Love these guys! I have a huge picnic every year for my job, and I always use Pistella for my beverages.  They're nice folks, always get the order right, and it's on time.  I've also been to the store itself many times, and they do indeed have a great selection."
"2","Animal Elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice & LISTENED to how I wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that I requested.\nI was very happy with my services and I will return. \n My poodles groom was $50,including tip, which I think is very reasonable."
"1","I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted, as well as speaking with the woman who assured me she would be grooming my dog. The owner groomed my dog, not the woman that I spoke with and she looked nothing like my dog when I picked her up. The owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service. Do not take your dog there to be groomed!"
"1","They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. \n\nThey actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: \""But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.\""  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. \nI think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. \nI used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it. I will avoid this place from now on and would like to suggest that you do the same."
"2","This is my go to place to get my Yorkiepoo groomed. The surrounding area looks a little \""sad\"", but let's face it, lots of areas look like that here in Pittsburgh. Inside, however, the place appears newer and well kept. My dog has gotten consistently good haircuts here and she's always in a good mood when I pick her up. That's a keeper in my books! Oh, and the cost is about $45-50, which I'd say is average for most groomers I've gone to."
"2","I wound up here the other night after walking down the street because of a 45 minute wait at Point Brugge Cafe.  While my friends and I were leery of the prices on the menu, the owner cajoled us into coming inside and were seated right away.  I'm glad he did!  The menu is rather expansive, but mainly focuses on Italian fare with an occasional jab at the more popular Pointe Brugge up the street: mussels and fries.\n\nIt happened to be lasagna night.  Because I am used to the home cooked variety, I had a hard time shelling out $18 for lasagna.  I selected the wild mushroom and spinach option and it also came with the soup of the day, which happened to be gumbo.  Both were very good.  The gumbo had a very earthy taste along with good amounts of sausage, jumbo lump crab, and risotto mixed in.  Rather than being the layered the lasagna was one giant noodle, the size of the entire plate, stuffed with a generous amount of mushrooms and spinach folded over itself with marinara and cheese.  Didn't get a chance to try dessert.\n\nBoth items I had were rather tasty, and I would easily come back here for a great meal."
"1","I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know, but the place was loud and crowded, the service was bad, and the food was mediocre at best.  I should have just waited it out at Point Brugge.  I won't becoming back anytime soon."
"1","I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival, the menu was very limited and the service was abysmal despite a nearly empty restaurant.  We literally waited 15 mins. at our table and then left prior to ordering."
"1","I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \""Italian frites.\""  The latter, which the menu described as \""fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\"" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!\n\nAs a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \""nice\"" restaurant?  Classless.\n\nConclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's."
"1","Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, and it's literally just that. Translation: the menu is uninspired and predictable. A relatively encompassing selection of appetizers and entrees revealed not quite a soul-crushing, but certainly a lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes and presentation, though the service was refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, the only other reason you'd be dining in Point Breeze would be to enjoy the amazing Point Brugge Cafe just down the street. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped in simply because the Brugge was full, but I unfortunately won't be making that mistake again."
"1","What a disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly and did not get much better.  \nWe had reservations for 5 people at 7PM this past Saturday. Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what \""awhile\"" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).\n\nFood was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.\n\nService was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate.\nNot sure Pino's will get a repeat visit.  Disappointment:("
"1","Bland food and poor service. Its a shame since it's a great location and could be much more, especially since there is always overflow from nearby point brugge."
"2","Enjoyed a wonderful evening eating outdoors on a perfect Pittsburgh spring night.  The charcuterie plate worked well as an appetizer for 3 and included a fantastic balsamic dressing.  I had the best pasta and white clam sauce I've ever experienced, and the other members of our party enjoyed their entrees, as well.  Nice find in the Point Breeze neighborhood."
"2","this place had a great selection. The mussels were outstanding and the staff was very professional!!. TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!!!"
"1","BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our \""go-to\"" restaurant.\n\nAFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\n\nThe food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe."
"2","I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way)."
"1","The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.\n\nWhat really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there..."
"2","Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the roasted veggie platter.  So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good we did!  They also had their doors open and we were able to sit outside in the cool summer air--great way to kick of summer!"
"2","I decided to try Pino's due to the restaurant week special and boy am I glad that I did! My husband and I made reservations for four on Friday night. We were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a great night to be outside. Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.\n\nThe table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature."
"1","I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years, and always enjoyed the pizza and hot subs. I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \""fresh pasta,\"" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \""al dente,\"" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?"
"1","My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town, we made reservations here because word on the street was that it was good. Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary."
"2","Stopped in without a reservation around 7 pm. I ordered the house soup. It was very yummy. The soup was a tomato based soup with noodles and chick peas. I also tried the sausage flatbread. The flatbread sizing easily fed one. My boyfriend shared with me. The tomato sauce and peppers on it really made the flatbread. \n\nI really one to come back int the summer when the front windows are opened and enjoy some wine and small dishesa"
"1","Nice atmosphere with above average food. This restaurant has a lot of potential. The wait staff was far below average: They were slow, and we had to ask multiple times for things. They were not the most polite wait staff, and our waitress was either a little demeaning or very socially awkward."
"1","We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \"" we have to get to Pinos!\"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!"
"1","I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert. \n\nBaked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess. \nLazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue. \nPanna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.\n\nMy friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why? \nWe tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.\n\nI don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there."
"2","I live in Connecticut and visit family in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. \n\nI don't have one favorite dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, I need to order it next time.\n\nMy brother is a retired chef and hates to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home. He loved his meal and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 of us). He was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time.\n\nOh, they also make great cocktails and have a very, very nice wine list.\n\nOh, if you think you can only get good fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!\n\nNo, it isn't cheap. But, I'm happy to pay for quality."
"1","I went to Pino's recently, only to be disappointed by the owner himself. I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.\n\nAfter my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \""apologize\"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \""never salt his steak again\"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. \n\nThe drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. \n\nOverall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have."
"1","Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour, my meal arrived and we were told that my friend's meal would be coming in a few minutes. Very awkward.t.  Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.\n\n  Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking? \n\nTo make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.\n\nLong story short....if you want to eat below average food and watch a chef loose it....this is your place!"
"1","This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again. \n\nI don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \""dish looks beautiful.\"" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is  \n\nThe table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \""I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\"" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up!\nAt this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \""it's not my job to make people happy\"" that's strange considering he wants our business. \nSo the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.\n\nI couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again."
"1","If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \""Chef\"" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place."
"1","Great"
"1","Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC, they didn't get back to me for the whole day, and decided to fix whatever the problem was without asking me and charging me an insane about (approximately $150 more than most places).  Definitely will not go back there again."
"2","I was passing through Pittsburgh and discovered a headlight was out.  I found Bastone through Yelp and drove over.  \n\nThey fixed the light on the spot charging me $12.  First impressions are great - very clean repair shop and the service for this minor repair was done in a friendly and welcoming manner."
"2","Love this place, really nice people willing to help and pretty decent prices.."
"1","This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me, that's about all it has going for it!  You would think that this means you can find what you want, and generally you can, but it also means enormous crowds, no matter when you shop here.\n\nYou know that a trip to a large, \""one size fits all\"" chain grocery store like this is not quite the same as shopping at Macy's or Boscov's.  You know that it's pretty hard to give a place like this five stars.  Its purpose is purely utilitarian.  But good gravy, you'd think that a place like this could handle large crowds.  It shouldn't take you a half-hour just to get one item.  \n\nThat's what happened to me yesterday.  I would have been better off going to Cogo's or 7-11.  I might have paid a bit more, but I would have been in-and-out in under five minutes.  I prefer the Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill."
"1","I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted, it has the basics you need, and is 1 of the biggest in the city itself.  Finding things takes work.  My big gripe is that it has one of the weirdest and most illogical layouts that I've seen.  It actually takes time to find what you need as compared to most stores where once you are in there a few times, you easily find everything.  Parts of this store are diagonal and that causes you to go in every direction possible.  Here is a quick summary of the setup as it can be classified as a maze:\n\n1.) When you enter the store through the slow wide door, you go to the left and walk past the front registers to produce.  Normal enough.\n\n2.) From produce in front of you (a quasi L-shaped department), you take a quick left and go diagonally to the right to walk past the pharmacy.  Take a hard right down aisle 1 and then you hit the bakery.   \n\n3.)  From the bakery, you walk along a long meat wall.  Diagonally to the left, you'll find the service meat/seafood counters. And because how the wall goes diagonal to the left, the sign for Aisle 9 is facing diagonally to the right so you don't miss it because the 1 side is longer towards the back than the other. (Aisles 9-14 are almost twice as long as 1-8).\n\n4.) From meat, you have frozen straight back on a long back wall in its own cove.  A hard right (if you bypass frozen) brings you last to hot foods, the deli, and then facing in front of you, the Customer Service desk which is tucked away in a corner (not really visible when you walk in the store).\n\n5.) Once you pass the deli and customer service, take a hard right, then to the left (almost a U-turn) to the checkouts, and then you take a hard left to leave.\n\nMost of the other Giant Eagle stores are much more logical in how their aisles and deparment locations are set up.   You're not going every which way to try and find things.\n\nAlso, the service isn't that great as one of the other reviews said.  Given that, I would take Market District on Centre Ave or GE on Murray Ave over this store.\n\nHowever, for those who remember the Giant Eagle on Centre Ave at N. Craig St, nothing beats how BAD that store was.  There is a reason that store was nicknamed \""the dirty bird.\""  Compared to that North Oakland store that closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE is light years ahead."
"1","I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle, of all the Giant Eagles, would get a five star rating.  From the moment you walk into here it's like someone has hit you on the head very hard and you walk around in a confused state the rest of the time you're in there.\n\nThe set up is ridiculous.  I mean, who wants to walk around in the freezer section and then go through a smaller than usual end of the aisle to see, SURPRISE, the meat section hidden off in an area where they could have knocked down the wall so you didn't have to do a little dance to get to it.  Aisles seem extra long in this store, you can tell that they worked with the space they had.  It's like when you are half way through the aisle and realize it's too late to turn around because it's the same distance to the end as it was to the beginning of the aisle, but you kind of just want to give up and sit on the floor because you feel like you've been walking forever.  \n\nHonestly, I only went here because I was at Target and didn't want to venture any further to complete my shopping."
"1","This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible.\n\n You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one, the prices are high. Secondly, this Giant Eagle does not carry everything you need. Who has time to run to another store? Just get your basic necessities here.\n\nAs for produce, it can be awful at times. Whenever I go to Giant Eagle Market District down the street, the produce is fresh and smells invigorating.  However, at Shakespeare, you are bound to find produce with wrinkles, open areas, mold and fruit flies- being sold at the same high prices. I can go to Trader Joe's and find much better produce for less.\n\nA pet peeve of mine is the self-checkout lines. Two of them are express lanes for items less than 12; the other lane has a belt if more than 12 items are being purchased. There should be TWO LINES but for some reason customers want to form one long super line, which holds up everything. The staff rarely sorts this out.\nThe customer service is average here and I don't expect it to get any better.\n\nI only go here if I have to grab one or two items. The best times to go are early in the morning or late at night."
"1","I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy, but carries less products to sift through when you just need to grab some simple things, hopefully not produce. Parking is easy and you can hit up the unpretentious Wine and Spirits in the same stop. I think this plaza still exists to prevent impoverished people from venturing into the other newer fancier stores which are a mere half mile away and designed to appeal to people who think they are cultured and discerning."
"1","Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for \""cutting in line\"". Will never go back. At night it is a nightmare."
"1","I agree with other reviews, this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense. Sometimes bigger is not always better. I used to head here often while living near Shadyside to stop at the Family Dollar & hit GE in one run. \n\nI normally only stopped here for a Redbox movie. My debit card got hacked at an outdoor Redbox at a Get Go so I'll only go to a Redbox that is indoor like this one. \n\nAnyways, I'd hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside."
"1","Ugh. Dirty. Long lines. Walked out without making purchase ."
"1","Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.  I don't remember her name but she is one of the \""bigger\"" woman there.  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sides/back cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later, we were done.   Yes, just like a bad date, we were done in 5 minutes.\n\nI got home, showered, and saw the damage.  It was messy.  What's worst is every day it grows, it looked even worst.\n\nI'll just stick to my usual barber."
"1","I wish I could return a haircut.\n\nUnfortunately Kelly, Melissa, and Jen were not there so I settled for whoever was free at the time. \n\nWorst trim of my life:\nshe cut off over an inch more than just the dead/split ends\nshe did not cut the hair how I described initially\nshe did not change the cut to how I repeated during the cut when I noticed she was cutting it straight across instead of curving it in the back, which does NOT mix well with my curly hair\nafter retelling her how I wanted it cut, she compared this tragedy to deaths of family/friends and how I should get over it\nthe beautiful long layers I had and wanted again are now choppy, medium layers\nmy left side is even choppier than the right side of my hair\nI fear straightening my hair to make this unevenness less evident\n\nI regret tipping her because I understand how the service industry works because my minimum tip of 20% for all service people is undeserved for her lack of work.\n\nI want everyone to know how the only good hair stylists there are Kelly (who moved to Philly), Melissa and Jen. If they are not available, do NOT risk going.\n\nAlso, the Supercuts Oakland location is horrible at waxing eyebrows unless you are lucky to get the only woman of color there.\n\nWhile it was a $20 cut (after the 20% tip), I know had to buy biotin to grow my hair faster so it is more expensive to me in the end. I hope this proves helpful to all perspective customers!"
"1","Terrible! I got a haircut here once and hated it, but kept waiting for it to settle in after a few washes. It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. \n\nI then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. \n\nThe \""stylist\"" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said \""sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\"" and the lady said \""oh we don't do that.\"" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. \n\nAnd waited, and waited, while one \""stylist\"" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \""on break,\"" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \""after I'm done here,\"" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving. Will never go back."
"1","Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores, but the food is only so-so.  We've ordered takeout numerous times due to proximity, and nothing has been bad, but nothing has been special.  The general Tso's tofu and the Moo Shu vegetables are the best things we've ordered.  The eggplant was soggy and not great.  The portions are large.  Nothing is particularly spicy even if it is mentioned as being spicy on the menu.\n\nPrice: Tasty is cheap.  \n\nDrinks: N/A\n\nAtmosphere: Typical Chinese takeout place.  A photo of every single meal they offer is on the wall.  Located in the plaza next to Pizza Parma.  Decent location for that end of Shadyside.\n\nService: The employees speak poor English but can usually understand what you are askingt/telling them.  The food is usually ready for takeout within 10-15 minutes.\n\n(+): many options, cheap, ready quickly\n\n(-): food is nothing to write home about\n\nWould I go back again? If I'm feeling too lazy/broke to go anywhere else."
"1","This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out and the service is rude. I decided to give Tasty a try because it's conveniently located on Highland Avenue and has easy parking.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon. Sadly, they prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food. It's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order. While it wasn't what I ordered, the food was good...but there is better Chinese food out there."
"1","Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again."
"1","Not Tasty At All."
"1","Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery, did not know my address which is right in squirrel hill, did not listen to me (or did not understand me?) when I tried to give him directions, asked me to pick up food from an intersection 0.3 miles away from my apartment in snow, and finally yelled at me to cancel my order. \n\nCannot comment about food, but whatever experience I had left a bad taste."
"2","Home of the Italian Army.\n\nVento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.\n\nThey have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. \n\nNo debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!\n\n(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)"
"1","I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good."
"1","We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!"
"1","Horrible Food don't waste your money\n\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\n\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \n\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."
"2","Oh I love this place. Their pizzas are square/rectangle! A single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. It is in the strangest location (Home Depot's parking lot)!! The picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. Love this place!"
"1","This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter, the lady working rudely told me to wait for my name to be called because she didn't have my ticket to ring up the order. Um, okay...then walk over and get it so i can pay for it! So I waited and waited as people who came in long after me got their orders. The \""workers\"" just stand around and spend more time talking to the regulars and trying to act like they are a big deal. I had to leave without my order after 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!"
"2","My cousin works here and that's the only reason i know about this place. The crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it. It makes the eating experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nI always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because I love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza. Plus if you dip it in ranch (big fattie) it taste even better. \n\nI took the hubby there just this week and he agreed that it is very good. They have tons of specials and even more menu options. We ordered the medium pie and 12\"" hoagie for only $13. Really good deal and the italian hoagie was not too bad. I do wish however that it was a little thicker. Maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness. By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie.\n\nThe interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. Also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. Waste of money if you ask me but to each his own. \n\nBTW, IT'S CASH ONLY HERE, but they do have an ATM."
"2","This is great, simple, traditional italian american food. The salads are good. The pizza is really great (I stopped ordering from anywhere else).  The veal cannelloni is awesome too."
"1","This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much, so I guess the place lived up to my expectations. I've been trying to think of a good way to describe their food, and the best I can come up with is as follows. Imagine a cafeteria pasta dinner you might have been served as a child away at summer camp, and you'll have a pretty good idea. In other words, the food is perfectly edible here, but boring, and nothing you would want to actually pay for. There was nothing disgusting about it, it was just extremely uninspiring. To be fair, I only tried the pasta, bread, salad, soup, and calamari, so maybe they have amazing pizza here... It's possible, although unlikely based on what I've seen.\n\nOn the upside, the service was friendly enough, and there were plenty of empty tables at prime dinner time! If you're hungry, you'll definitely be full when you leave."
"1","I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.\nThe only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM, so if you are desperately starving, not able to go to better restaurants nearby or heat up food from your local grocer's freezer, this might be a tolerable food option.  Again, it is advisable to be desperately starving."
"2","The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal, but after calling it into my insurance company, they directed me to come here.\n\nWithin minutes of me hanging up my phone with the insurance company my phone was ringing to indicate that Mikes was calling to set up an appointment to get my car in for an estimate.  I set up an appointment that was convenient for me and went about my day.\n\nWhen I arrived here to have my car viewed it was quite the easy task.  My wait was minimal, the staff were polite and I wasn't being jerked around.  Within five minutes of them looking at my car, I was out the door and heading back to my place.  \n\nUnfortunately, they did not do any work to my vehicle at this point because the police are still looking into the person that hit my car.  But if we get to that step, I am confident that they could not do anything wrong in my eyes.  If their body work for a vehicle is anything like their customer service, they are definitely one of the best places to go in the city.\n\nYes people, this isn't the best neighborhood in the city, but get over it."
"2","Mike's doesn't really need another stellar review on here, but I'll give them another one anyway.\n\nI'm a choir director at a church, and after rehearsal a few weeks ago, one of my choir members ran into my car in the parking lot and crunched the rear bumper. Bummer...\n\nI had never had to file an insurance claim before, and wasn't really sure what to expect. Dealing with Mike's was about as easy as it gets. I called to set up an appointment for the estimate and drove down a few days later. I was only there about 10-15 minutes and got sent on my way.\n\nA few days after that (Monday), I took my car in for the repair. It did take a couple days longer than they said, which is really the only negative thing I can say about Mike's, but considering I didn't have to pay for the rental car, it wasn't a huge deal. When I did get my car back (Thursday), like others have said, it was in even better condition than when I took it in (besides the dent, of course)! They had cleaned/waxed the outside, and even cleaned and detailed the inside! If they just did detailing, I would take my Impreza there every time! Mike's rules!"
"2","Mikes took my car after horrible repairs/service from Kenny Ross South.  The service was great and I even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy Friday afternoon.  Great guys there."
"1","I took my car to Mike's auto body as it's recommended by Geico and is part of their easy claims and repair process.  This was a big mistake.  Like many of the reviewers here, I was initially told it would take a certain amount of time, and then, at the last minute, on the day I was supposed to get my car back, they told me it would be a few more days.  Their excuse?  The headlamp that came in didn't have a bulb with it.  Seriously?  Since this was the Geico rep telling me this I couldn't really argue, but I don't know why Geico keeps working with a business that repeatedly does this to its customers.\n\nI got the car back in great condition, cleaned on the outside, and the console wiped down inside.  All in all, just alright - go here if you're not pressed for time and you've got Geico, otherwise shop around."
"2","I never grew up with a pet so getting one was a new experience. I had always heard kill/no-kill shelters whatever... I got my new dog Crosby from ARL which happens to be a \""kill shelter\"". Thinking about this, I felt truly good getting him there because I felt as though I was saving him from some other destiny. However, he is so cute that I'm sure someone else would have adopted him...\n\nThe shelter itself is large and the volunteers and vet-techs that you interact with are very friendly. The dogs are constantly walked and you can tell the animals receive a ton of love from the staff. Adoption is made easy unless you rent in which case you should probably bring a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to adopt. Another perk is that when Crosby had \""kennel cough\"" we went after hours to get him some medication and they still let us in and treated him...In short, great adoption experience at ARL."
"2","I could never stop saying good things about the Animal Rescue League! As other reviewers have pointed out, going there both breaks and warms your heart.  I adopted my puppy, Brock, back in January, and I couldn't be happier.  The staff was super helpful and very kind. They gave us enough time to make sure Brock was the right dog for us, and also made sure we knew what we were getting ourselves into. (Brock is a husky mix, so he's a ball full of energy. Great running buddy! :) ) \nI will most definitely be back and plan on telling all friends considering a pet to adopt from the ARL!"
"2","I love, love, love my puppy.  After visiting every shelter in the city and finding nothing, we came back the next day after seeing a posting for a 2 month old terrier mix.  Our poor little guy had been dumped in a park and some very nice person brought him to the ARL who took him in, waited 3 days for someone to claim him, and neutered him.  He wasn't even supposed to be on the floor yet when we got there, but they were super helpful and brought him out to us and let us take him home.  The staff there were super helpful and wonderful to my incredibly anxious fiance- imagine a first time dad bringing home the baby!  \n\nThe only reason they only get 4 stars is my poor puppy is SO sick.  We've had him for 3 weeks and he's got an awful cough that hasn't been responsive to any antibiotics.  I know its hard to keep all the dogs isolated, but I really think 8 weeks is a little too early to neuter a puppy especially after being found in a park- too much stress!  Hopefully our little guy starts getting better soon, we're awfully worried about him!  Still love the ARL though!"
"2","A few years ago, I lost my partner and love of my life in a tragic accident.  While struggling with my horrific grief and having difficulty getting back into life as I once knew it, my grief counselor suggested that I \""help something else\"" in order to help myself feel better.  We decided that since I was an animal lover I would try volunteering at an animal shelter.  I was not working, so I had a lot of time and wanted the shelter to feel right.  I visited a few, they all do good work, but the one that kept drawing me back was the ARL.  Yes, the building is old, it's a bit run down, but that doesn't stop the staff and administration from doing the best they can with so very little and in not the best of space.  I saw a bathroom be \""renovated into a vet tech office, I saw the janitor's closet renovated and made in to the \""rodent room.\""  Where cats once lived in cages along the halls of the ARL a new building next door, an old gas station was made into the \""Cat Adoption Center!\""  When you have staff that are still young and are going on 5-10 years + at the same shelter, (same place of employment for that matter) you know something about the place is right!  I volunteer easily 30 hours a week at the ARL, I get to see the good, the bad and the ugly, and I can tell you first hand that the good is in the staff, the Executive Director, Dan Rossi, and all of the work that goes on for the animals.  The staff knows EVERY one of the animals, they do all they can to care for them, and keep the doors WIDE open for both domestic and wild animals, even if that means a staff member or volunteer takes a cat or dog home!  The answer is never ever \""no\"" to any animal.  I also volunteer for the Humane Society of the United States and travel around the countryside working on dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, and the ARL has never said no to me when I ask to bring animals back from incredibly sad or inhumane situations.  Technically, by the numbers, it is a \""no-kill\"" shelter, because it is open door people will often call it a \""kill shelter.\""  Yes, sometimes an animal does have to be euthanized.  The ARL is the Animal Control shelter for the city of Pittsburgh and with that can bring some very upsetting and disturbing signs of animal cruelty.  It can also mean it's the dog who just bit a kid that you just saw on the news.  The ARL has an obligation to society to not let dangerous dogs back on the street, to euthanize when a dog is very sick or is very aggressive to humans or other animals, and trust me, I have held many of those dogs as they are put to sleep and I always am so thankful that the vet staff we have are so compassionate and do the euthanasia in the most humane manner.  That's a tough job, it's heartbreaking, but in some cases it has to be done for the good of the animal and for the safety of society.  I admire the work and staff of the ARL and will continue to devote my time to them and thank them for the wonderful work they do on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh and all of the wild and domestic animals alike.  We are so lucky to have them in our area and as our city shelter."
"1","Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!"
"2","I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\n\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.  The shetler staff care deeply about the animal AND the human's well-being!"
"1","Staff members here have always come up short. A past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it. \n\nThey will lie to surrendering families because they don't  want the cold hard truth, the good, bad and the ugly to leak out to the public. They lie ! \nThey kill many many animals because of a very subjective behavioral test that their dog hating staff performs .\n\nThey kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter.\n\nMany volunteers walk on eggshells here because they know an animals life is hanging in the balance and they are afraid to speak up or not allowed back in to volunteer . \n\nWeak leadership. This is the cities highest cat and dog death rate of any shelter or rescue in western pa"
"1","This is a terrible shelter.  It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill, unless you state you will take them back) cats because they are \""overcrowded.\""  They will tell you that your cat has a \"" behavioral issue\"" to address turning said animal away. Mark that you will take your cat (or dog, etc.) back or else you risk having them \""put down.\"""
"2","I've had such good experiences with ARL, that I will probably return here again and again.  Years ago we adopted a mutt of a puppy that turned out to be the best dog that I could have ever imagined.  But let me talk about my most recent visit.\n\nWhile browsing Facebook, I noticed that they were having an event at ARL.  This particular event was called the Free Fur All.  The event involved free adoption to qualified adopters, free micro-chipping for any pet (adopted there or elsewhere), free dog baths, and goodies for both human and furry companions.\n\nI had plans to get Little Man E microchipped during his appointment to take his manhood away (don't worry, we've talked about it and he is fine by it), but when this popped up and said it was free.  Hot damn, you know I was in line.  It's also probably one of the more easy and humane ways to keep ties on your dog or cat just in case they were to run off one night.\n\nOnce we were registered, we waited at most for 15 minutes.  It's a very quick thing to have done.  Little Man E didn't even flinch.  He was more amused by his reflection in the table than that little pinch behind the shoulder blade.  I have to give huge kudos to the staff there.  They are so very friendly to not only you, but your pet.  It's like they talk their language.  I also have to thank them because while we were there, LME somehow ripped his one toenail and they were kind enough to clip as much of it off as they could (no extra charge either!).\n\nOnce done, we just walked outside to see what was up (E skipped the bath).  We visited one of the tables and E selected a ball and bandanna and we decided to head out after that.\n\nThis place is amazing for so many different pet oriented things.  I'll definitely be coming back here whenever I need something for LME."
"2","I just adopted my second dog from this shelter, I think they're wonderful! You must keep in mind that no rescue shelter is going to look like a 5 Star hotel and be able to keep every animal free from illness, but the ARL does a great job. All pets are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and receive a microchip. Your first vet visit after your adoption is half-off their already cheap prices at their in-house vet clinic. They also give you a little goodie bag along with the pets vet records.  I'm so thankful for the furry friends I've adopted from the ARL!"
"2","Vincent has done several hems and jacket alterations on men suits for me. Items have always been one time and done well. I would recommend this place to anyone searching for a tailor in Pittsburgh. \n\nIt does seem a little expensive, but worth it, because its done correctly."
"2","It was 1:00 pm on Friday and i was in a serious bind... I needed new suit pants altered and my flight was leaving the next day at 10:00 am. I called and Vincent said he would help. He got the job done, with a smile and his work was perfection. \n\nI would recommend Vincent to anyone needing alterations. Great customer service."
"1","This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\n\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\n\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \""this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\"": shelves are only about 4'6\"" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\n\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile."
"1","I go to this CVS all the time, since I work in the neighborhood.  I'm not a huge fan of it - I go mostly due to convenience.  Their greeting card selection is kind of lousy - I don't think I've ever found a decent card here.  I keep trying, every holiday or birthday, but every section is just full of duds.  Also, a lot of stuff is locked behind panels that you need the employees to unlock.  Like, razor blades.  And body wash.  BODY WASH?  It drives me nuts that I need to ask someone to open that shelf for me.  It makes no sense.  Staff is hit-or-miss with friendliness.  Some people are cheerful, and some act like they want you to go away.\n\nGood things - I love their coupon rewards.  I guess that's for all CVSes, not just this one, but it keeps me coming back because I get mad style coupons like every other visit.  And I had a good experience getting a walk-in flu shot from the pharmacy from the friendly (and quite attractive) pharmacist.  \n\nI'm just not crazy about the vibe here.  It just seems kind of depressing, with the stuff locked up and the smallish store with kind of a blargh selection.  I would much rather go to other pharmacies, but you can't beat this one for convenience (for me, anyway).  And they have a parking lot, if that helps you."
"1","Never again. Let me repeat, never again. \n\nThe primary reason I used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions. Due to their repeated inability and ineptness in fulfilling simple requests, I cannot continue to patronize this store.\n\nWalking into the store, you are given the stink-eye by a minimum wage security guard, which automatically gives you as a customer the warm and fuzzy \""guilty-until-proven guilty\"" feeling a shoplifter would get, which is what this store assumes everyone is based upon their decision to lock up the mouthwash and shampoo.\n\nThe pharmacy seems to be staffed by high school interns.  They have no concept of customer service, nor do they display any attention to detail, which is quite frankly frightening in a pharmacy.  I really think my chihuahua would make a better pharmacist than the people who work here - my chihuahua lick you to death before you got your prescriptions, but at least you'd get greeted when you approach the counter, and you'd get what you ask for.\n\nThe first mishap was when my wife and I changed prescription insurance providers.  i handed wanna-be pharmacist #1 my new insurance card.  After spending about 5 minutes staring into a computer screen behind the counter, he assured me that they had my insurance information in the computer.  I then returned in the following days to fill a prescription, trusting in what wanna-be pharmacist #1 had told me in the days prior.  When I went to check out the bill came to over $300, which I chalked up \""maybe I have to meet a deductible before the coverage kicks in.\""  Upon further research, we discovered that wanna-be pharmacist #1 had NOT updated my insurance information and had run the numerous prescriptions I filled under my old insurance.\n\nThe latest of many \""adventures\"" involved my wife calling in a prescription refill.  We stopped to pick it up on the way home from work, only to be told when we arrived that the insurance won't cover the refill until tomorrow.  Again, she CALLED and SPOKE to one of them to refill the prescription before showing up.  I guess it's too much to ask to TELL someone you're speaking to on the phone that they need to wait a day for the insurance to work before coming into a ghetto pharmacy to not pick up a prescription.  But hey, at least wanna-be pharmacist #2 behind the counter was dressed like a stripper, which gave me and my wife some comic relief for the moment.  \n\nWe then returned the following day to (again) pick up the prescription we called to have refilled 2 days prior.  We were first told by wanna-be pharmacist #3 that there weren't any prescriptions waiting for us.  After searching around for a few minutes, they \""found\"" my wife's prescription refill, but it would take 10 minutes to be ready.  Yes, the prescription that we tried to pick up yesterday would need another 10 minutes to be prepared.  Hence, I am now here, writing this review.\n\nNever, ever again."
"1","The times I've been here, its been an OK experience. However, their store hours are absolutely terrible. Closing at 7pm basically means they're never open when I would need to go there. Despite this being more conveniently located, Walgreens and Target end up getting most of my quick-shop business, simply due to late hours at night when I need to cook, clean, realize I'm out of toothpaste, have a headache, need a last-minute birthday card or whatever."
"1","This place is a disaster. I made an appointment online for 5:30PM. When I got there they refused me service, asserting they close at 6:00PM. Nevermind that online published hours are from 7AM to 7PM. Furthermore, their own system sent me a confirmation email for my 5:30PM appointment. Finally, this building is an absolute dump... Goodyear should be ashamed to have the brand attached to it."
"1","Tire replacement, was told it would take about 1.5 hours (when I had an existing appointment). It's almost been 2.5 hours and I'm still waiting. Ridiculous."
"1","I experienced three main issues with this Goodyear location while purchasing/installing a new set of tires:\n\n-They did not have my name or appointment in their system when I showed up. Fortunately, they still honored my appointment. \n\n-They did not install tires correctly. Left for a business trip the following day, and once I got on the highway and my speed passed 65 mph, the car began to rattle (with my new \""comfort tread\"" tires). Booked an appointment, and they fixed the issue.\n\n-Two months later, I went to my Toyota dealership for routine maintenace. The dealer mechanic found that the lugnuts on the tires had been over torqued by Goodyear. So the Toyota mechanic had to saw them off of each tire and replace them with non-security locked nuts. (If I had a flat on the side of the road, I would have been SOL).\n\nAll of these issues were entirely preventable. The lack of expertise and techincal skill at this Goodyear location is abysmal. I do not recommend."
"1","I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable, so I said OK.  Upon arrival, store manager stated that they will not touch the car as it has aftermarket rims and lug nuts.  He did not state any restrictions about aftermarket parts as they could not guarantee the work.  I asked if this was the case for all rims and he became a little snotty.  I had heart surgery a while back and I can't do the jack and tire work as not to tear at my incision/breastplate, if this was not the case with my health, I'd certainly take care of it.  Aftermarket rims are common - should not be an issue.  Last time I ever set foot in that place."
"1","Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something, Rockwel Realty will do it on their terms and refuse to give you notice of when they will enter your apartment despite multiple requests\n\nWhen asked to clean mildew, they did in fact clean it with bleach while also spilling bleach on my sheets and ruining them. When told about this problem and that the mildew returned they said it was my fault for not turning the heat up and that damage done during service is an inherent risk the tenant is responsible for and nothing could be done. Their solution was for me to clean the mildew instead of properly insulating the unit to prevent mildew. \n\nThe entire building also has severe electrical problems that causes all lights to be replaced twice a month. No permanent fixes are made to existing units, but there is constant construction to expand an old building so they can collect more rent."
"1","Exceptionally poor maintenance service. They refused to start heat before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. On another occasion, they refused to change a rusted and weak lock. The lock eventually gave way and I locked myself into the bathroom. After the incident, I requested that the lock be changed immediately, and one of the owners threatened saying that we were in default of our lease agreement for not keeping our apartment as clean as when it had been leased to us. Dealing with Rocco and Elisabeth is nice, but good luck getting anything done with Nick who seems to be increasingly handling the operations of Rockwel."
"1","I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA."
"2","This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. It offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. Still ha that neighborhood feel though. I have never had food there though they offer paninis. Great desserts. Good espressos and okay coffee.Outdoor seating. Good place to study. Plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless."
"2","Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.\n\nIt is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.\n\nEnrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.\n\nOther reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).\n\n- free wifi\n- outside tables\n- tasty treats\n- they have a blog!\n- really great coffee\n- the staff are coffee experts"
"2","Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.\n\nThe coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.\n\nIn addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.\n\nAll that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation."
"2","One of my favorite coffee places in Pittsburgh. THey also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food. Otherwise, they have plenty of pasteries/cookies to eat that are pretty good."
"2","Some of the best coffee I've ever had.  Ever.\n\nStick with an Italian Cappuccino and bring a good friend for some good conversation."
"2","Quick service, amazing coffee, nice vibe."
"2","Good coffee!! The atmosphere is nice, it was good to get out of the cold when we took our walk :)\n\nThe coffee was good, and not too expensive."
"2","Outstanding lattes. Period. \n\nThe service can be *very* slow, but the latte is worth the wait. And, the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers, but they make darn good lattes so who cares.\n\nTucked in the beautiful Highland Park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful Bryant street restaurants, Tazza D'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. A nice short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you. \n\nThey also have food, but I cannot speak for that. The interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character."
"2","Finally, a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. The espresso is incredible, which makes for an excellent cappuccino, and the food is pretty good, too. Croissants, muffins, and other baked goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu.\n\nThe crowd at Enrico's is varied, which I really enjoy. My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good brew.\n\nNo frills, no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop, brewing up warm goodness."
"2","It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews!  You did not steer me wrong. \n\nA nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was good to go.\n\nIt looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair.  We got the next to last free table.  Almost every \""two-top\"" had only one person sitting at it.  I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes. \n\nRecommend!\n\nP.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here."
"2","What a great find! I frequent the nearby Bryant street restaurants, but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. I immediately fell in love it. The baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! There were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which I will need to go back soon to try. There was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. It would be a great place to study, read, or visit with friends.\n\nYou should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink, but it is well worth it :-)"
"2","BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!\n\nYou might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!\n\nI love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.\n\nI love this place, and you will too!"
"2","Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh."
"2","This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!"
"2","Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy."
"2","I've heard a bunch of good things about this place, so I decided to make a trip over there on a Sunday to check it out. While I enjoyed the coffee and cookies I bought, I have to say that everything seems to be a bit overpriced and I did get a feeling of snobbery from some of the staff. However, the venue was actually nice with a nice neighborhood feel. Every time I have been there since it has been really crowded and I've had trouble finding a seat. I would love to go back in the summer and sit outside at one of the tables."
"2","I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.\n\nIt it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.\n\nI usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.\n\nI'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip."
"1","The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back."
"2","I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down."
"1","The coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. If you're a local, I get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. \n\nI really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. \n\nThe last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment \""ya well we just got it\"". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you \""just got\"" to taste good...\n\nThis place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off."
"1","This is not a review on this gym. It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to \""talk\"" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes, I know what they are trying to do by talking to you face to face. I am sorry, but I want a gym, not a drug dealer. I don't need you to try to shove your products down my throat, I want to go somewhere to work out and be left alone. (That's why I wear headphones and don't make eye contact). \n\nI just wish places like this would give you a straight answer about their membership fees without hassling you. I won't go here now, period, because I don't believe in these kind of tactics. Just be straight with people, is that so hard?"
"2","I'm a gym guy. I go 3 or 4 times a week among other workouts and activities. \n\nPros\nAlways towels\nVery clean\nAlways cardio equipment open\nPools/hot tub\nLots of lockers\nFriendly staff\nLots of classes\nLots of free wights\nNext to target and trader joes\nEven during peek hours it's never over crowded\n\nCons\nWhen the old lady's come in they take up all the parking spots some how. But that's not the gyms fault\nOnly one flat bench press\nSince they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areas\n\nSo in the end more pros then cons.\nThis is more just nit picking but as all gyms have them. There are a few weirdos who are members and just take up space more then workout but oh well what can ya do about it."
"1","The food here is okay.  Wings, BBQ, Bar foods. The floor here is always super slippery.  It doesn't matter if I am wearing heels or sneakers.  I just don't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink."
"2","Living down the street of Buffalo Blues has it's advantages and disadvantages.  The huge beer selection means there is something for everyone.  For any game there is always a crowd and you can have a good time eating the wings, which are decently priced and good.\n\nThe bar is nice in the summer when they open the garage doors.  It's a nice bar to get a beer with friends where you can grab a table to eat then hang out at the bar to watch the game.  But, while they have a good number of HD TVs, only two are broadcast in HD so don't think you'll be getting a great picture."
"2","In the last week I've been here twice, partially because I don't know any better and partially because it's actually pretty good! It's one of the few places that doesn't reek of cigarettes, it's never crowded and the open garage doors are great for fresh air.\n\nI tried their buffalo (boneless) wings last night in the jack daniel's sauce  - way better than Sharp Edge's. The sauce was pretty mild but still quite tasty and if you're not a super wings eater, you can get a fries/wings combo for super cheap. To wash it down I had Loose Cannon beer, how can you pass up a beer with a pirate tap handle!\n\nOur waitress was a little slow, she said it was her first night. Who makes a new girl work on a Friday night! She seemed to have gotten more attentive and fast towards the end, or maybe it's because I wasn't hungry anymore so I didn't care.\n\nThe beer was pricy - Tuesday night I had a maker's sour for the same price as a pint of beer..."
"1","The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. \n\nThe food, however, is bland and is terrible bbq, even for the northeast. I would not come here unless you want to watch a game that you cannot see at home."
"1","I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions, and their wings were rather small.  I actually liked the wing sauces I tried, though (red hot and spicy garlic).  Our server was friendly, but not terribly attentive.  \n\nI would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night.  For $10 I would certainly get my money's worth, and the quality of the food was OK.\n\nSurprisingly, lots of vegetarian options.  A vegetarian in our party was floored by the possibility of having every burger or chicken sandwich made without meat or meat products."
"2","My local sports bar.  It has the prefered sound and  enough televisions so no matter how busy it is, my neck isn't cramped and I don't have to strategically place myself to listen to a game.  \nIt is a bar.  It has bar food.  Nothing really stands out for me in the realm of fries, sandwhiches and wings.  On the other hand, I've never had a bad experience either.  So when I eat there, I'm not anticipating dissapointment or spectacular, but I am expecting constantcy.  Consistancy is what is delivered.  \nBuffalo Blues does have a wide array of enticing imports and domestics.  \nService is spotty, I do find myself hoping to find the more personable staff working when I go there.  The plus is, when specific staff is working, the  place is that much of a better establishment.  Consistantly just above average in my opinion.\nI chose 4 stars because it is constantly an above par establishment.  5 stars would require something really enticing to set it aside in character from a slew of other sport bar venues.  I would like to observe the spring/summer atmosphere inwhich I'm anticipating another review to be 4 stars."
"2","Great Pittsburgh Happy Hour! $5 dollar apps and dollar off tap beers.\n\nThey have a wide selection of draft beers, so if you like to enjoy flavors other than Miller Light this is a great place to go and enjoy some IPAs at a good price.\n\nWide selection of $5 apps too. We ordered the BBQ Nachos, and they were amazzzing with multiple z's! I crave them all the time now.\n\nGreat service too. Our server was happy and excited to be there. She made the atmosphere more fun.\n\nGet there :)"
"1","I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential."
"1","My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and it was a pretty \""meh\"" experience for me.  We were seated all the way in the back of the restaurant/bar, in a room that I didn't even know existed, so apparently Buffalo Blues is bigger than I thought.  It's nice that they have some tables away from the main bar area.\n\nI went for the Hot Veggie Sandwich with sweet potato fries, in some kind of attempt to be healthy.  The sweet potato fries weren't too bad, with a good flaky crisp.  The sandwich left something to be desired.  It wasn't hot, first of all - I'd say the (slightly crumbly) bread had been toasted with the cheese, but all the veggie ingredients were cold, leaving an overall lukewarm effect on the sandwich.  The hummus spread didn't taste much like hummus, and was thick and pastey instead of smooth and creamy.  There wasn't a lot of exciting flavor,  It was just belly-filler, really.  I guess that's what I get for trying to order healthy here.  \n\nI just wasn't much interested in it, and I don't think it was worth anywhere near $8.  I better have a darn good sandwich if I'm paying $8.  Also, it was relatively small in size - I don't have a huge appetite, so that wasn't a problem.  But I guess I think an $8 sandwich should either be awesomely delicious, or big enough that I can take half home.  Buffalo Blues was neither.\n\nNot particularly interested in returning for any reason."
"1","Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the \"" who really cares about this game\""  show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason, she kept the glasses full and kept checking in with us, and took it all in stride as we ordered at different times and all had separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \n\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \""EH\"". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture. The commercials and time with fun friends saved the experience but I wouldn't go back to eat. Just drinks and sports. I like the location. Easy to park. Close to shadyside. Madonna really was the show stopper this night and unless she performs here I most likely won't be back."
"2","I've heard about this place, I've seen this place, and I've wanted to try this place. Finally, yesterday my company took us their for lunch and I did not leave disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is not a restaurant that is redefining the culinary scene in the city, but it is a tasty place to enjoy your traditional burger, fries, and drink.\n\nThe atmosphere is total sports bar, but it is not overwhelmingly so. The staff was nice and for being in a party of 14, the server handled us well.\n\nThe food was great! I got the Salsa Burger subbed with a turkey burger and it was delicious. The burger was plump and large, full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I recommend this burger! It also had salsa and guac on top with some cheddar cheese and my mouth is still watering for it. Tip? Get the sweet potato fries!"
"1","When Hotlick's died, Buffalo blues was born. It really is a Pittsburgh staple but come on....\n\nFood is really, really average. I love the ribs and wings, but it's about the same as any other rib place in the city, only they charge an arm and a leg for it. This place is for the people that feel that they are at a real rib place, but don't want to cross Centre or Penn Ave. to get real ribs. It, technically is in Shadyside so your Mercedes will be safe! \n\nThe ambiance: The restaurant is always crowded. Not just crowded, but packed with teens underage drinking, families with too many kids that overflow to your \""space\"" and collage kids who also spill over from the bar. IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!! Forget about a nice quiet dinner. There seems to be no consideration for customers at all. Last time I was there, there was a St. Patrick's Day party (it was NOT St. Patrick's Day) that took over the whole place. Though the staff tried (nah, they didn't really try) to keep them in the so called \""party room\"" I was bumped into several times, spilled my beer, and couldn't hear my wife speak. But as long as they got their money; they could give a crap. Oh and there are like 100 TVs to interrupt any conversation at your table.\n\nWant to sit in the bar area? Good luck. You will see a mix of drunk people, women who look like high-end prostitutes and college kids who are only missing a beer bong. Also IT'S LOUD AS HELL!!!!!!!!\n\nThe \""wonderful\"" Staff: It seems like it's everyone's first day. To put it lightly; the staff suck! To be sure, you will be waiting for your your drinks, food and bill for a very, very long time. Expect to be there for about 2-3 hours. The wait staff are forgetful, inattentive and very sloppy at their job. It pains me to leave any tip for them. Most of the staff are hot, stacked, absolutely stupid and should be working at Hooters not a place where your bill will be upwards of $50 for two people. Be prepared to be met with this saying, \""Oh, like ohmygod, I am so sorry i forgot that, he he!\"" (oh she's twisting her finger in her hair while she's talking). You will get bad service...period (in fact, I can't remember the last time a wait person actually wrote down my order, and they're idiots so no worries).\n\nThe food: Kinda good. Menu is huge, you'll find something you like. But I go there about 2-3 times a year for the food. It is way too expensive. Do not take a date there. Your average bill for a meal with actual proteins will run you in the high 40s without booze. There are so many bar-food places that don't claim to be high class that are just as good as this place. I grew up with the rib sauce and love it, but for your average consumer, skip it!\n\nThis place is a wannabe sports bar that tries too hard to be high end. Just watch out for the vomiting college kids with trust funds...they're everywhere!!!!!"
"2","Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. \n\nDrinks: 3 stars, for the decent variety (better than expected from a place like this) and the game time specials.\n\nService: 3 stars. Could have been better, could have been worse. Friendly but unattentive and not good at realizing when to come to the table. (Hint: if one person calls you over for a drink, make sure the rest of us are set before running away.) \n\nAtmosphere: 4 stars - really good job of having enough televisions for everyone to see the game/s and marking each so you know what's on. \n\n1 Bonus star for accommodating the Pittsburgh area Buffalo Bills fans! GO BILLS!!!"
"1","Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. Since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.\n\nWriting this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. The beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. I essentially live across the street so I know I'll go back, but I hope some of these poor reviews will help them turn things around in the kitchen."
"1","Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo, NY."
"1","Pass on this place, there are better restaurants mere feet away.\n\nThe menu here is too large, which is a sure sign none of the food is going to be good.  And, its not good.  Some of the salads are alright, but its just not good food.\n\nThe service is friendly and prompt, but the beer is over priced.  They do have a good selection though.\n\nThis place is open late if you need a bite to eat, but there are so much better options out there."
"1","This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving the service one. We didn't eat anything so I can't comment on the food. \n\nMy husband and I went to Buffalo Blues last night. We stood at the empty hostess stand for a while. When no one came to seat us, and we couldn't find anyone to seat us, we seated ourselves figuring that's what we were supposed to do.\n\nThe bar was full, but not packed. There were only two other tables with guests, one of which had empty plates on the table during this entire experience. After what seemed like forever, my husband got up to find a server. He literally walked around the restaurant to find someone, but couldn't. He then tried to ask the bartender, but she was just as elusive. When he finally found a server,  she acted totally shocked that we were there. Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.\n\nShe came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order. After another ten minutes of waiting for her to return, we put a few dollars on the table for my soda and we left. We ordered a pizza at a local shop and picked it up on our way home.\n\nTwenty-five minutes passed and we only get drinks? Such a waste of time. It took us 20 minutes just to make the drive there, 25 of waiting, and another 20 to get home. That's over an hour of our evening completely wasted which left us starving after a hard days work. I used to work as a server so I could understand if the place was busy and the staff was short handed, but it was basically a dead night table top wise. I will NEVER go back."
"1","I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service."
"1","Went here this past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!"
"2","Loved the hot vegetarian sandwich. Not easy to find veggie dishes which don't feel like a compromise. This was great. Excellent service from waitress Ariella with the long black pony tail (don't know her last name). Nice casual atmosphere. Resonable prices."
"1","I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  \n\nI love it because it's extremely close to me (so, it's convenient when I'm craving a beer) and the atmosphere on Sundays is outstanding.  I'm a giant Steeler fan, but you'll probably find fans from all 32 teams in Buffalo blues, which gives it a fun and exciting feel during NFL Sundays.  \n\nHowever, I hate it because I believe the alcohol and food is overpriced.  The food wouldn't rub me the wrong way so much if I thought it was worth the price, but I don't.  Not even a little bit.  The only thing I have found to be delicious there were the wings; however, you can go to almost any other bar to get delicious and cheaper wings.  So, it's not really much of a win at all.  Also, I want to have a handful of beers during the games, but I don't want to empty my pockets doing it.  So, all in all, I recommend going once and awhile (mainly on Sundays) for a beer or two, but other than that it's not worth much of a visit."
"1","To be honest, I think this is one of the worst bars in the entire city.  The food was sub-par, even for bar food, the service was awful, especially during a game. I do enjoy a good sports bar, but I think the thing I hated most about this place was the other people that frequent there. It's the quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped with doughebag bros that went to the same fraternity in college and the Jersey Shore bimbos who pine for them. The last time that I went there were two guys throwing up outside of the bar on the sidewalk. I fully admit this is a subjective review, because this bar was obviously not my scene- but I still do not like this place at all."
"1","Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back."
"1","Watched a bartender serve a guy a beer when he was visibly intoxicated. He was swaying in circles on the chair next to me. I told the manager about it and he told me \""that guy is just crazy, I've seen him much worse\"" so I guess that makes it ok. Made this paying customer leave after one beer."
"2","I may be a little biased... this place is right down the street from my house and we go there frequently, but I think Blues is great. \n\nI have had quite a few things in the menu but two things that I love more than others are the cobb salad and the Oscar's Garbage burger. \n     The cobb salad is just a cob salad, but some how they make it better than most. I don't know if it's the sprout or the dressing, but it is one of the best cobb salads I have ever had. \n     And the garabge burger....Mmmmmmm. This burger caught my attenetion at first because it has an egg on it. I lovelovelove a burger with an egg on it.  I don't know what genuis started the egg on a burger trend, but kudos to you!\nBut that's not all. Imagine a Primanti's sandwich but with a big, fat burger. It has fries, cole slaw, an egg and American cheese. My BF often comments it's strange there's no bacon, but honestly, that'd be over kill. \n\nThey also have a really good veggie sandwich with Hummus (I don't remember the name), a great buffalo chicken sandwich and fantastic appitizers. \n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning they hace really good hand cut fries- not those mushy frozen crap sticks- and GREAT fresh homemade potato chips. \n\nNow, as far as the ribs and wings go, I'm not a big ribs/wings person. I can appreciate that they're good, but I wouldn't order it much. Having said that, my BF frequently orders one or the other and I always have my fair share of tastes. he raves about them so....If you looking for a nice place to watch a football or hockey game or just craving some good food I highly suggest it!"
"1","I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour, and met my daughter there last night for Happy Hour specials as advertised on the web site.  First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here."
"1","Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar."
"2","China Garden appears to be your run of the mill Chinese take out place (standard menu, decor, etc) , but I was very pleasantly surprised how good the food was.  We had both the cashew chicken and seafood delight, and both were awesome.  Also worth noting they are super fast (food was ready within 10 minutes).  I'd easily say this is the best Chinese takeout place I've found since I've been in Pittsburgh (about a year).  Highly recommend it."
"1","The hot and sour soup was ok. Everything else was basically inedible. Water was not noticeably hose-y as per other reviews. More than 1/4 of the buffet was american food, and a lot of the rest was seafood that almost had to be \""krab\"", considering the price of the buffet. No pot-stickers, no pork egg rolls, no spareribs, no won-ton soup."
"2","This is my 2nd time here and I thought that I attributed the satisfaction of my first visit due to the fact I was sooooo hungry. Well my 2nd time and for a Chinese Buffet, this place is fantastic. The restaurant itself is very clean. The buffet is also very clean and even though I showed up within an hour of closing, they were still bringing out fresh entrees. The amount of choice is less than just about all the Chinese Buffets that I have ever been too, but in my opinion they make up for that in delicious food. All the patrons here are American, so this isn't the Asian place where the Asians eat. It's very non-spicy, non-original food, but it's fresh and good tasting. I would certainly return. Giving it 7.5 Knuckles out of 11."
"1","This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad, but not impressive neither, plus some cheap American food. The food was a little too greasy even by American Chinese food standard, and my stomach complained soon after I left that place. To me, that's a no-go signal.\n\nOn the other hand, they seemed to have a non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps the food would be better there."
"2","I have a cat, so this review is cat-centric.\n\nGreat independently owned pet store.  They only carry more premium foods, so if you feed your cat Fancy Feast or Cat Chow, don't come here for that sort of thing.  Also only carry the more eco-friendly cat litters - no Tidy Cats here!  Friendly staff, and the prices are not much more than you would be paying at Petco or similar places.  Of course, you don't get the huge selection either, but this is my go to place for buying food, litter, and random toys.\n\nIt makes me feel good to be supporting a local establishment.  Try it - you might find that you like it too."
"1","That is a great cat they have working, but they only have 3 brands of cat food, all of them expensive.  Funny enough though not as expensive as what I was looking for.  They followed me around like I was going to stuff my pockets and that just ruined the whole mom and pop thing."
"1","Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us."
"1","I had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when I went to pay, the guy at the register actually says something to the effect of \""Do you have any idea what this is supposed to cost? So, I could charge you $400 and you wouldn't know the difference?\"" Joking or not, why even go there?"
"1","Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic."
"1","I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\n\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \n\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\n\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.  Guess that cracking wasn't so bad after all."
"2","The new manager, Ray, was really friendly and helpful. Had to diagnose something with my car-done quickly. I usually go to the Monroe in Wexford, this one is just as great! Thank you!"
"1","I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. \nThey removed all the tires, showed me how the sensor and ABS work, did not perform the diagnosis I originally went in for and told me that I should have the back wheel hubs replaced for a total of $1,222, this with a new set of breaks (that I knew about) and \""without\"" charging me labor. \nI may not know much about cars but I know how to search the internet and ask for advice. I found the cost of wheel hubs, they are no more than $150 each (for my car) and here they said that they cost $550 each (before labor). \n\nI also found out that the sensors get so soiled from all the dirt and salt that most of the time all the car needs is a simple wash on the undercarriage. You should always have your car washed, specially in the winter. It may save you $100's.\n\nThis place will rob you blind.\n\nNever have work done in a place like this until you do your homework!"
"1","I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  \n\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  \n\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.  Avoid this shop."
"1","Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. \n\nIn March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. \n\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). \n\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \n\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \""would work with me\"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? \n\nIf you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle. If you need an oil change go to Midas on Penn Circle they'll be able to get you in and not wait three days."
"1","Ah Monro, where \""45 minutes\"" is actually 2 hours and running at the time of this post. My car is on a lift with no tires and the employees are smoking cigarettes laughing. I can't even escape if I wanted to. At least they turned the heat off in the waiting room. Not like it's November in Pittsburgh or anything..."
"1","I wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society."
"1","Please go to the other McDonalds (not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W).\n\nOne time while using their drive-thru service, we realized they forgot to add an item on our receipt. We asked how much the real total is and the employee told me, \""like $5.00.\"" WHAT!?!!?!!  CAN YOU PLEASE USE YOUR REGISTER TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THE ACTUAL TOTAL IS!"
"1","Prepare to be wowed. \n\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence."
"1","I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. \n\nMaybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down."
"2","Walter's is just a fantastic establishment.  Tim is a phenomenal mechanic, who is as honest as they come, charges amazingly low prices, and - Morten H. is not lying - will actually suggest ways to save you money.  The shop is small and usually pretty busy, but they will do their best to fit you in and get your car fixed up ASAP, and Tim always takes time to explain your car's problems to you.  He will even show you what's wrong inside the car, or tell you how to do something yourself if that's what would be more sensible.  I recommend Walter's to anyone who's in the market for a mechanic."
"2","I cannot say enough good things about Walter's.  Tim, the head mechanic (Tim Walter, hence the name of the shop), is amazingly helpful and accommodating.  He repairs my car quickly every time I go in, and I never have to bring it back for further repairs.  He also fits me in right away (though it is a good idea to call ahead - they do get super busy because of their sheer awesomeness and small size).  And when I pick my car up, he'll explain what was wrong and how he fixed it in a completely unpatronizing way, then usually undercharge me.  I know, sounds too good to be true, but isn't.  I'll be moving for grad school soon, and I can honestly say I will miss Walter's.  I don't think I'll ever find a better shop/mechanic.  \nA quick word of warning: Tim's adorable, but completely ADD.  He'll fix your car well, and quickly, but he does get easily distracted sometimes.  Bear with it, he's totally worth it."
"2","I went to Walt's due to the reviews I saw here on Yelp.  I like supporting local business and I also wanted to find a garage I could trust.  There was nothing wrong with my car I just needed the oil changed and I asked them to make sure I was \""good to go\"" for the winter season.  They changed the oil, check my tires and topped off all my fluids all for $36.  Tim is a helpful guy and will take his time to explain things to you.  They seem to be quite busy all the time which I see as a good thing.  However, it does mean that you have to call ahead for an appointment and you may not get your car in on the same day.   I will be going back for all my car care needs!"
"2","Tim is fantastic with German cars, including my 2003 3-series BMW, which was out the door for 400 - broken axle, oil change, tire rotation and one other thing. Labor prices are reasonable, it's just hard as hell to get an appointment. If he weren't so damn nice (like doing all sorts of free things for people) he could probably have himself a bigger, better garage and more people working for him."
"2","As numerous people have pointed out, Walter's is indeed a great repair shop.  Tim (Walter is his last name) and the rest of his staff are friendly, honest, professional, and reliable.  I highly recommend this shop for repairs, maintenance, and check ups.  \n\nHowever, they are victims of their own awesomeness.  The waits here can be long--2 weeks or more--due to how busy they are and they only have one bay.  If you do have a pressing safety concern though, Tim is always willing to take your car for a spin or do a quick diagnosis to let you know if something needs to be taken care of."
"2","Walter's garage is awesome!  I was in real trouble with my car and needed immediate repairs and he managed to fit me into his busy schedule and charged a fair price for the work.  He was kind and honest--what more could you ask for from a mechanic?  :)"
"2","I have a general rule of thumb when picking out an auto repair shop:\n\nThe \""office\"" must be very messy and grease and dirt must be everywhere.  \n\nIn my opinion, if an auto shop has the time and money to keep a squeaky clean appearance, they're wasting some of your money you pay for service.  Walter's Automotive fits the bill with their \""office\"" being a small cluttered desk in the service bay.  Their \""lobby\"" is the doorway that you stand in just outside the \""office.\""  I couldn't be happier with my first impressions--to me, minimal overhead means maximum service and value.\n\nSure enough everyone at Walter's is very nice and helpful.  Apparently, everyone else in Pittsburgh knows this since I have to schedule an appointment 10 days in advance just to get my car inspected.  So please, even though Walter's is awesome, don't come here--I want this place to myself."
"2","I was having an issue with the emissions light in my car. I spoke with Arlene, who gave me a rundown of what I could expect while my car was in the shop. She then told me that even though they were very busy, I could stop by before my appointment so that Tim could check things out and make sure my car was safe to drive. Tim poked around, figured out it was the gas cap, and sent me on my way without charging. A good mechanic is worth their weight in gold and I will not only return to this garage but refer others as well."
"2","Another five-star review, this one from a newbie.  The brakes on my Honda fit were making a frightful sound.  I was sure I'd get the full-rotor press from the chains, because that's kind of their job.  The dealer sold me the car in the first place, so I don't like them. (Not 100% happy with the Fit).  A little research turned up Walter's 42 5-star reviews, so I thought I'll give them a try.  I wasn't certain they'd be able to see me soon enough, but whatever.  Walter called me back within 1/2 hour, told me to get the car in ASAP to make sure it was safe to drive, 'and then if you have to go somewhere and wait, you have to go somewhere and wait.\""  I delivered my car 1/2 hour after that, went somewhere and waited, and had it back, fixed, within another hour, for less than 200 bucks. Walter's garage from now on. Yep."
"2","I had to give Walter's 5 stars, if there was a way to say it was exceptional, I would do that.\n\nI found Walter's through yelp and was not sure how a auto repair shop had all 5-star reviews. This is totally unheard of. And now having gone there for a repair and inspection, I can just say, BEST MECHANIC IN TOWN. Other people have sung praises for Walter's already, so I won't get into that. My recommendation: If you are looking for an amazing, trustworthy, competent and humble mechanic, dial Walter's number. You will not be disappointed."
"2","Went to Walt's Auto for an inspection after seeing all of these great reviews on Yelp, and was so happy I did. I will be taking my car and my husband's truck here from now on. The service here cannot be beat!"
"2","Walter's is the best and most honest mechanic I've ever worked with. They are super busy because they are so great, so they have no need to do unnecessary repairs. Can't speak highly enough of quality of their work and integrity!"
"2","Finding a decent, honest auto mechanic is always a battle. I can't stress enough how amazing Walter and his team are. They are very friendly, personable, honest hard working people. I would never go to another garage in Pittsburgh. I can't stress it enough!"
"1","The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips, the bathrooms don't really have the capacity for over 300 patrons, etc.\n\nBeyond the facility you get to the actual 'poorly executed' idea.  The staff is extremely un-knowledgeable about the subjects they are producing.  For instance none of the programmers on staff have any training in performing arts, they are all visual arts people playing at another field.  As a result they don't even know what they are really producing and any experienced person in the field can tell.  \n\nThe sad part about this is they REALLY try.  They throw staff and new ideas at every opportunity.  Don't expect great performances here, expect a talked up mediocre performance.  \n\nAudience follows content and they don't have content or the staff that is knowledgeable enough to know better.  Check back in in a couple of years.  This apple is too green to eat much less pay for."
"2","I am at Food Glorious Food every weekend. I always try to sample something new every time I go, and everything I've had has been wonderful.\nThe cupcakes are so buttery and the fillings and frosting so creamy (and sweet, but not over the top sweet). The fruit tarts are also excellent-- my favorite is just topped with a very generous amount of cream and and assorted fruit (berries, kiwi, mandarin orange, etc). Ahh, soooo good.\nI haven't tried the focaccia (yet) but they look incredible. And I ALWAYS get a biscuit. Every time.\nThey recently expanded their hours, and are now open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And they will take orders by phone. So if there is something you want that is a popular item, you can call and they will hold it for you until you get there! \nThe line can be long but the staff is very efficient-- I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!"
"1","I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.\n\nWhile I've been to better bakeries, I will definitely be back. I have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friends.\n\nThere is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners."
"1","I've had a wide range of experiences here.  Let's just say, when I first moved here, one of the employees gave me poor advice and ended up totally screwing up my title.  It's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed.  Another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too.  Now I'm working with a third person who seems very competent and committed to helping me solve this problem, but even she is like \""I can't believe those other people told you to do that....they made this so much harder than it needed to be.\""  My thoughts exactly.\n\nWork with Barb, if you can.  She knows her stuff.  I don't quite trust anybody else to help me properly.  Also they're only open from 830-4 (or is it 430?) so you pretty much have to go before work, or on Saturday.  And I will be going in tomorrow at 830 until my car title saga finally comes to its conclusion....\n\nAlso, parking is free in their lot.  And if you are a AAA member, I think your fees are lower, or something like that.  I do have AAA, so it makes sense for me to come here - I can't say what the experience is like for non members."
"1","If I could give negative stars I would. After this review, I'm writing the president of AA and if action is not taken to correct the disservice at this location, I will never be a AAA member again. (been one since 1999) \n\nI recently moved from TN and needed to transfer my title and register my Dodge Ram in PA.  This process is costly regardless of where you go, but adding $36+ for every transaction makes AAA the most expensive.  I'm willing to pay for people to deal with this inconvenience for me, but AAA has made it worse than going to the DMV.  Each and every clerk at this location is incompetent, uneducated, and aloof. I should know, I've dealt with at LEAST a dozen. Go to the DMV.\n\nFor my very simple transaction, I've had to return to this location 7 (yes that is SEVEN!) times, and it still is not resolved. They've forgotten to request the title from my lien holder, issued the wrong plate for my vehicle, neglected to inform me of steps required by the state... I mean seriously, why would you pay $36 for EACH visit, just to get it wrong. Go to the DMV!\n\nWhy did you return there if you were so unhappy, you might ask.  Well once you begin the process at one branch, you cannot transfer to any other branch. (We went to Monroeville to transfer my wife's car and it took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go to Monroeville, or cancel your AAA membership and go to the DMV!!\n\nOh, and 30 minutes? that's a dream... I'm waited between 45 minutes and 3.5 HOURS at the East Liberty AAA. Prepare to take the day of work... nay, the WEEK in order to complete any transaction at this facility. Go to the DMV!!!!\n\nIt has now been over 5 months since I started this process and it's still up in the air. they don't know what I still need to do, but they are happy to keep charging me to figure it out.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and a weeks worth of lost wages and just GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah it might seem sterile and slow, but at least they aren't serial criminals. It'll be over with like waking up from a bad dream, instead of the reoccurring nightmare that is the East Liberty AAA.\n\nOh, and if you think this is a harsh review... Call their number, 412-365-7196. 9 times out of 10 it just rings and rings.. once I timed it for more than 30 minutes before I got an answer (with no apology).  If you are in the AAA, you'll know I'm calling.  It's the constant ring in the background that NOBODY answers."
"2","This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. It's a bit edgier than most of the others bars in the area, which also gives it a lot more character. This place is one of the closest things that reminds me of an urban-artsy feel that I'm used to in Southern CA. \n\nShadow supports local artists and has weekly open mics. Only downside is I'm not used to paying a cover for open-mic sessions, but I understand an establishment needs to raise some dough. The drinks are decent and there are many local and big artists that come here for shows. \n\nAlways good vibes at Shadow!"
"2","Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis."
"2","Combinacion!\nThis place is the shit for real.\nWhere's the Patron at???\n\n(b)"
"2","One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in.\n\nI just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music, fun crowd, pretty decent prices on drinks. I'll definitely be going back for Titletown and in general, Shadow Lounge is a great place to see alternative acts in Pittsburgh."
"2","AVA/ Shadow Lounge is a place that I would take my out of town guest on a Monday night.  With the live music and well mixed drinks, it is a place that is sure to be a good time. \n\nIf you're luck to nab a seat/table near the door I would recommend it.  Since the live music can be loud, it's a great way to enjoy the band and still carry a conversation.  Definitely stop by and check it out- you won't be sorry!"
"2","Um, amazing. Is this real life? Or is it just a shadow? Just kidding about that joke. But seriously, I was blown away by the drinks, specials, servers, food, manager, space....that I couldn't understand why it wasn't packed on a Monday night that happened to be Martin Luther King Day! Callen (I think I am spelling her name right) is an incredibly sweet, efficient, and talented bartender; Solomon on the grill whips up a KILLER (but without death; veg friendly) tofu and bean fried taco; and Justin is an offbeat, dry, and very cool bar owner who is interested in providing an open space for his community - they have held a huge number of widely different acts in the past, and plan for more in the future! Look out! Geeeez, guys, AND you have drink specials erry dey? Thank God I got there on $4 margarita night. Nothing impresses me more than a dern good margarita, I don't care if it comes in a tall glass.\n\nThe bar itself (I don't think we're in AVA anymore, Toto...) can get mildly confusing if you don't bother to learn the layout until you're three margaritas deep, so let me advise you in advance: AVA is the part that is glowing green, and feels like a cozy, well, lounge...Shadow Lounge is the rest. There is a large, yellow room containing the main stage, and a blue, intimate room with a half-bar. \n\nWho wants to go with me on a Wednesday for ~experimental~craft~drink~ night? Oh, and no, they're not hiring."
"2","Enjoyed the winter solstice concert Saturday night. Fun scene, cover benefited charity, drinks were decent (nothing spectacular), but the grilled cheeses moved this review from a three to four star rating. Fun night, cool spot. Will go back!"
"1","There were zero other people here aside from my friend and I."
"1","i was here for a concert the other night. apparently, there's much more to the venue than the side we were on where the stage was, but it was a pretty small area for a pretty big crowd. ok, so we arrived shortly before the opening act and ordered beers. $4 for a yuengling bottle isn't ideal, but whatever. we snagged a table with stools near the door before too many people got there. by the time the opener was over, the place was packed shoulder to shoulder, and whether we stood or remained on our stools, it was nearly impossible to see the stage.\ni liked that it was an intimate venue, but that many people packed into such a small space, with expensive drinks, and not even a good view? not the best venue i've ever been to..."
"2","I agree with Stacey B. I am not cool enough for this place. I Spoke with Jay Malls briefly, and he was indeed cool ,This is one of the best R&B DJ's since Venus Flytrap. (from \""WKRP in Cincinnati\"" )\n\nI hope to stop in again soon . It is worth the trip."
"1","Fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine, but all the other stuff...meh.\n\nI've only really gone in here to pick up paint, so I'll focus on that.  I feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter.  Each time I'm in there she always seems to be by herself with a line of customers all wanting there base paint tinted.  I don't believe there was ever a time I could just walk up to the counter and have my paint mixed for me.  Give that woman a hand."
"1","I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. \n\nEmployees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice, they just don't care.\n\nI'm a pretty understanding person, but when this sort of thing happens more than once on the same visit, it's time to go. There are plenty of HD's around, seek them out and skip this one (especially if you're going to have questions)!"
"1","What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY, but no longer.  \n\nI stopped by yesterday to pick up about nine items, all of them basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc.  I came away with NONE of it.  Everything we wanted was OUT OF STOCK!  When I asked if I could order it and have it delivered to the store (to save the shipping costs) I was told that the items I wanted were not \""qualified\"" for delivery to the store.  \""When will the items be restocked?\""  \""Don't know.\""  \""Would it be possible to get the items delivered from another store in the region?\""  \""No, that 'messes with' our inventory controls.\""  Oh, but I was told I could haul my sorry butt out to Monroeville where the stock of everything I wanted was plentiful.  Really? \n\nThe staff I dealt with could not have cared less about helping me.  Maybe because it was a holiday (New Year's Eve).  Dunno.  Don't care.  Customer service should not ebb and flow based on the day/date.  \n\nThe East Liberty HD used to have shelves full of product and plenty of choices.  And the staff was helpful and eager to engage with customers.  No longer.  It appears that the company has given up on the location and is letting it die a slow and painful (for its customers) death.  \n\nVERY disappointing to me."
"1","Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!"
"1","Fairly mediocre, even by the relatively modest standards of Home Depot. Unfortunately, this is probably the best you're going to do for hardware in most of Pittsburgh."
"1","Tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency.  fail."
"1","A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  \n\nWhen our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.\n\nWe then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.\n\nThe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.\n\nIn the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).  We would have liked to have a small 'info talk' about the steps that will take place, why they are that way, the tools used, maybe some quick science behind it, then get to work on the item."
"2","Went here with my girlfriends last Saturday.  They were having a girls night event.  A small bar & desserts were included in the price.  It was $40 per person. We loved it!  We worked closely with a glass artist.  We didn't just watch, we were acutally doing it!  We made glass flowers, I can't wait to pick mine up!  (It takes a few days.)  I definitely recommend this as something different to do with friends or on a date! My one friend did a glass blowing event there & said that this was much more HANDS ON than the glass blowing was."
"2","Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish."
"2","This place is outstanding. I always get great discounts, and all the mechanics are very honest and helpful. I am certainly not rich and Marvin is always willing to assist me with my budget and what needs to be done on my vehicle. I've been given very specific directions on whatever needs to be worked on, taken back to the garage and allowed to see the old/new parts with no hassle. I would definitely recommend going here."
"1","This is the greasiest pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh, I couldn't eat it."
"1","Provolone sticks arrived undercooked, cheese was fully solid, they tasted okay. The pizza also arrived undercooked, the dough itself was partially uncooked in the middle. I had to put it back into my own oven to finish it off, and then it was greasy and just okay."
"1","Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well, and were tender and juicy, but they had almost no sauce on them whatsoever; luckily I had some wing sauce in my fridge in order to save them. \n\nMaybe it was one bad night, and I can give them another chance later, but based on my one experience, I can't recommend this place to anyone."
"1","Ahh, the only place near the train station that is open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full of people who are way too jolly for such an early hour. I got a slice of cheese pizza and onion rings. The pizza was decent. There was nothing flavorful about the sauce and the grease would not stop oozing out of the cheese. I felt sick before I got halfway through it. That reminds me - the slices are HUGE, and are $2. The onion rings were extremely basic - I gave most of them to a couple of drunken girls who debated about what to eat for half an hour.\nOne irritating thing I overheard: as a girl was trying to place an order, the cashier kept interrupting her to say things like \""we don't have those anymore\"" or \""no, we can't cook wings dry.\"" Sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated."
"1","This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure..."
"1","I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.\n\nI figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty, looked tasty, and yes it even tasted tasty.  Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, and three types of cheese.  \n\nI have to say that even though I was saying yes, my body was saying, 'OH hell no!'\n\nI'm regretting this decision now as I am sitting here in discomfort.  Not sure what on the salad made me feel this way.  But I'm not liking the effect I'm getting right now.  Could just be karma turning around and kicking me in the ass for eating what looked healthy but was really nothing more than the equivalent of a fried chicken sandwich combo meal from a fast food joint.\n\nI'll think twice before the next time rolls around to order from here."
"2","Good food"
"1","When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place."
"1","I am not a mean person, not a vindictive person. I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\n\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\n\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \""personal\"" pie, costs $7 and is 7\"" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \""small,\"" which is 10\"". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\n\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\n\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \""I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\"" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\"" pizza is, and started eating.\n\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \""well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\"" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \""it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\""\n\nI ate three out of the six \""slices.\"" (One sixth of a 10\"" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\n\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\n\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago? It's still in my mouth. I'm not making this up.\n\nI know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back to back slices at Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa was this terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh."
"1","I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience\n\n--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. \n\n---- misleading advertising it boasts \""high capacity\"" washers an says its air conditioned, well the air conditioners and vents in the ceiling both were dripping in black dust and look like they were installed in 1963. which might have been why I felt an instant asthma attack coming on. \n\nThen the high capacity washers were all of 2.... not great enough to meet demand as it turns out one girl took up both of them while I was waiting. Then another woman waited for hers to wash and took up two again this was at 1030-11:00  pm at night so I can only Imagine what its like to try and get one at other hours. \n\nThen there was this guy I guess he was an attendant or the owner, he was wiping down the machines and dryers. I was moving my clothes out of the dryer and I had put my bras hangers and a few shirts on top of my washer. I was literally loading right in the same area and was heading back to grab my things when he touched them!!\n\nUgh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes it feels like that time in college when someone would mess with you and dump your clothes behind the washers if you didn't move them out quickly enough. Sooo that pissed me off...... but I have to get the job done so I load up my clothes. \n\nI come back in to check on drying clothes.... and what do I find but my dryer mysteriously switched from high heat to low heat. Now I am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load. All in all I spent 8$ at the econowash for 2 large loads I wasn't able to do my third load in the washers he had for under that. I can do that much at Laundry Factory around the corner though. So I will be going there. I don't need a creepy dude changing my dryer settings and touching my stuff."
"1","I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....\n\nI attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \n\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \""fresh\"" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \""whole food\"".  And at least I put my cart back."
"1","I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.\n\nHere?  Well, first of all, the parking lot is a death-trap full of upscale SUVs who have no idea how to drive courteously.  (A few pointers: use your turn signals, wait your turn, drive slowly in a parking lot, and put your cart back!)  My blood pressure skyrockets the second I even try to pull in here.\n\nSecondly, the whole store seems weirdly dark.  I don't know if it's the high, exposed-ductwork ceiling or what, but it's depressing.\n\nThirdly, they offer plenty of bulk beans and nuts, but few varieties of rice.  \n\nThere are a few good points, though.  The sushi (at least the vegetarian varieties) are good, and the desserts are delicious and beautiful.  The salad bar and prepared foods always look good, and the staff is friendly.  But I still try to avoid Whole Foods as much as possible simply because of the insane parking lot."
"1","Whole paycheck is a fitting name.\n\nThis Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late.  \n\nI used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.\n\nWhole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. \n\nNow it's just more expensive."
"2","I always used to avoid Whole Foods because I thought it was way more expensive than Giant Eagle or Trader Joe's.  I recently moved to a new apartment and made a quick run to Whole Foods to stock up on groceries.  It's now the closest grocery store to me, so I figured, why not just this once?\n\nThere was tons of interesting looking stuff, and I found myself getting carried away and filling up my cart way more than I had intended.  I braced myself for the total in the checkout line and was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't much more than I typically spend at Giant Eagle.  On top of that, the produce stayed fresh for way longer than GE's typically does!  From now on I'm going to stick with WF for all my fresh produce needs (along with a few other specialty items -- some of their frozen Indian food is surprisingly good), but I'll still go to GE for my everyday grocery shopping.\n\nSure, their parking lot is a madhouse, but so is the Market District's."
"2","Compared to other Whole Foods locations, this one is tiny! For comparison, the Whole Foods in Las Vegas must be at least three times the size. Still, it's nice to have and it is pretty decent overall albeit pricey."
"2","Hello!\n\nI work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1, you can find me in the salad/bread area (on the north end). \n\nCompared to other Whole Foods I've been to, I would actually rate it a 3 but considering I do not know of any other Whole Foods around, I thought it's my duty to those that do not know about Whole Foods a chance to give it a try. If the zucchinis at Market District looked a little weak, give Whole Foods a try. Plus their pre-made food is actually yummy.\n\nI'm able to keep my lunch on a budget by only buying lettuce and chicken from the salad bar (typically under 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, and cheese in my office. I've tried buying the bag of pre-washed lettuce but I never finish them and I hate seeing them go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad at all.\n\nOther notes: The tofu chicken is really good (part of the salad bar)! It's not always available though. Also, none of their bread varieties impress me. I like their sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably have it everyday. I'd give their cashiers 5 stars. =)"
"1","Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.  Waste of time AND money overall."
"1","Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.\n\nForever skeptical.\n\nThat's too bad, I don't mind paying extra for better produce or better brands. But, I KIND OF mind getting extremely sick, so sick that anything I ever would vouch for goes down the toilet, with my vomit."
"1","Great selection of vegan, vegetarian, raw milk, prepared foods, bakery, cheeses and aged beef. Very expensive, trader Joe's and Market district come to mind as a cheaper alternative. Parking at this particular store is a nightmare."
"2","I find it really easy to save money at Whole Foods. Did you know that you can stack a Whole Foods coupon with a manufacturer's coupon? If you google \""Whole Foods deals,\"" you'll find a whole slew of couponing blogs that tell you where to find the coupons. Most are available online too, so no worrying if you can find the coupon section from last month's Sunday paper.\n\nI don't find their prices that outrageous compared to other stores in the area for the things I shop for. The 365 brand is a good value and oh, do I love the bulk bins.\n\nThis store barely compares to the Whole Foods in other cities, but its a start! I don't get here as often as I like since I'm in the South Hills. However, when I do go, I try to get here before 10 a.m. on a weekend to avoid the parking lot craziness."
"1","everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive, heavily polluting pick up truck.\n\ninside: avocados are the price of gold, and there are no goddamn vegan taco spices at a place that's supposed to be so fancy.  \n\nmeh.  go to market district where they keep it real.  real classy!!!"
"1","MEAN CUSTOMERS -ALOOF WORKERS+GOOD FOOD = CRAZY!\n\nOfficial Rant of an Angry Woman:\n\nFirst off - I shop at \""Whole Paycheck\"" cause my household eats organic and whether I like it or not WF has the best organic food prices in my neck of the woods. IT'S STILL GOD DAMN RIDICULOUS EXPENSIVE but I take my family units nutrition and health seriously! WORD!!\n\nDownhill from here...\n\nTHE CUSTOMERS AND PARKING LOT ARE MORE BAT SHIT CRAZY THAN MENTAL HOSPITALS I'VE WORKED AT!\n\nI have watched more rich bitch elderly women NEARLY murder pedestrians and crash into cars trying to park their Lincoln Continentals in that parking lot than I'd ever care to witness!\n\nAlso - I am a mother with a young child and have been SHOVED by above mentioned rich bitches while reaching for products out of the freezer cases WITH MY CHILD IN MY ARMS! I briefly entertained SHANKING said bitch but alas prison orange is not in my color wheel!\n\nThe customers are the worst human beings on earth (::thinks about self, shakes head, laughs...except me of course::). YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE SHADYSIDE HAGS! You treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt. If I worked there I would hang myself in the cheese section! The customers are the worst cross section of Pittsburghers ever!!! \n\nThat said- I understand why the employees are like stunned fish - keeping things close to the vest so that RICH BITCH SHADYSIDE MONSTERS don't feast on their flesh in fits of rage!\n\nBUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT...one female cashier who shall remain nameless SHIT on me and treated me like a tree killing whore when I handed her one Internet print out coupon on a single sheet of computer paper - she ROLLED her eyes and PAINSTAKINGLY tore my coupon out of the paper and then folded the unused paper and placed it in her pocket! I am a tree hugger getting judged by a tree hugger! FUKISUMA you! I'm a mom trying to do right for my family - feed them healthy -GO TO HELL!\n\nIf you see a woman and child dressed like Rambo and Baby Rambo running through WF screaming and wielding gallons of milk - it's me trying to survive another trip to WHOLE PAYCHECK HELL!"
"2","Yes I am a fan and yes I am Shadyside yuppie. Judge me if you want. \nI love everything about WF and it is my go-to grocery store. I try not to give my business to GE. WF's hot bar has fed me many many dinners, in exchange for money of course. However, that is what I call money well spent. I agree with the other reviewers that the parking lot can be a little crazy, but I live around here, and it's the norm. I am just glad that there is a huge double decker parking lot. Also, you can always park farther away and not have to deal with the mess. It's good for health! The produce is fresh and for regular grocery you have a wide variety of healthy choices. The cherry on top is that the staff is always friendly, super helpful and happy!"
"1","Oh Whole Foods, you are so so very overpriced.  I so so wish you were not, because I love the idea of the place.  But I just cannot bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here.  I can't bring myself to spend the big bucks!\n\nThe place is always packed and you're usually left bumping into people left and right.  You may even get a nasty look, yikes!  The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....\n\nI stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.  When I run in to grab sushi and usually ad Odwalla by bill comes to almost $20!  I'd rather eat a fast meal at Qdoba...sorry...I said it!\n\nMy feelings can best be summed up with this....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UFc1pr2yUU"
"1","the parking lot @ this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue, whole foods allows their purveyors to park on centre ave (a road that is already miserable enough to drive on) and block traffic. this past monday, a shearer potato chip truck was blocking the right lane. doesn't whole foods have a loading dock? i wrote an email to the district president and he had one of his store minions respond: \""you can park @ walgreens\"". sorry, i am shopping @ wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers were TOO CHEAP to buy the proper amount of real estate. dont even bother coming here fri-sun unless you like a clusterF*** lot full of zombies. this is the 5th WF i have shopped @ (4 in florida) wholefoods should have opened in the south hills. the demographics out there would support it. this wholefoods is BUSH LEAGUE!"
"1","I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best."
"2","I'm in walking distance, which makes it my primary place to shop for food, and to crown myself as Le Duchess.  :-)  I also don't have to battle the SUV Soldiers looking for prime parking spots - because those people are CUT-THROAT and will most surely kill you (but seriously - they will.  I've been brushed on the leg and knee multiple times by cut-throat drivers in that parking lot.  I believe they would park INSIDE the store if they could).\nI don't complain about the prices, because the food, and health benefits, are worth it in the long-term.  Not so long ago, I was forking out hundreds of dollars a month in prescription medications because my diet was HORRIBLE.  Since making the decision over two years ago to be more active and eat solely organic and Non-GMO, I'm off all of my medications, and the price of organic food is NOTHING compared to medications and prescriptions.  I'm actually saving money.  And No, I don't even make $20K a year - so it's all about choices.  I'm not \""rich\"" at all, like most people assume, since I regularly shop there.  In fact, I'm usually dead broke.  But to me, eating whole and healthy and protecting my body is not a luxury, it's a necessity.\nI also like that there is no pharmacy in Whole Foods.  That should say something.\nMy love for Whole Foods resides in the Organic Salad Bar, and Prepared Foods section.  Their salad bar is so fresh and so delicious, that eating salads anywhere else becomes TASTELESS.  Organic makes all the difference.\nMy favorite Prepared Foods is their Vegan General Tso's \""chicken\"".  Little popcorn nuggets of Seitan, drenched in the best General Tso's sauce I've ever tasted, with steamed broccoli.  Molly's Sesame Noodles on the salad bar is our favorite side dish to this prepared foods treat.  I swear we eat it at least once a week.\nWe also love their Bulk Section where we can get bulk quinoa, granola, lentils, and all kinds of things for a really decent price.  \nThe secret to shopping at Whole Foods?   BUY WHAT YOU NEED TO EAT THAT DAY.  It's not smart to bulk shop organic produce, because it goes bad faster.  Buy what you KNOW you're going to eat.  You won't see 10/$10 deals, because the food isn't crap, and you're not supposed to stockpile fresh foods.  You're supposed to eat it when it's fresh.  And buy your dry stock at Trader Joe's or the East End Food Co-Op.\nI love Whole Foods.  It's the reason we chose to move to ShadySide."
"1","I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole, hipster employees and presumptuous, anti-bourgeois customers that will literally push you aside a turn their noses up at you a million times. The rumors were true!!! \n\nEven though I was only there one time, first impressions are a bitch! The selection is great! I can't afford any of it, but it's great! I have never seen such expensive rice! Here is the bro-down...\n\nThe food: Plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying. The freshest fish that isn't in the Strip...but you need to take a second mortgage to buy fish for a family. I bought sushi rice, a piece of fish and a salad, my bill: $25! The salad with lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions and about 5 pieces of chicken was $11+\n\nThe employees: Hipsters with thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos and facial piercings that slack like I have never seen \""workers\"" slack before. In fact there was a sign above some fresh fish stating \""We will prepare you fish any way you want, just ask\"" HA...HA! When I asked to have a tiny fish to be filleted (something that would take me about 10 seconds at home) I was scoffed at by the so called fish monger who was obviously not a trained fish monger, but got his job because of his Progressive music of the soviet era bachelors degree . It took him the better part of 20 minutes to fillet a f-ing fish! All I got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless. And scoffing is what these people are good at. Pushing your cart down the aisles is like running a scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff and puff when you get in their way?! The cashiers just stand and talk to each other or run to get organic iced tea to drink WHILE they ring you up...they don't even do that at Giant Eagle!\n\nThe other customers: This one is a peach! If you're not pulling in a good $60K a year you are dirt to these people. I was at the salad bar (it is a good salad bar, but expensive) an older woman in a mink coat bumped, no, pushed into me then stared at me and turned her nose up at me, can you believe it? She actually turned her nose up at me! Others in the aisles will grunt like cantankerous old people if they can't get through. They push ahead in line, give you dirty looks, and act like it's a class struggle...it kind of is!\n\nSo unless you have a lot (i mean A LOT) of disposable income, have never needed to use coupons, drive a $50K car (parking is terrible there), are the president of the United States, CEO of Microsoft, a widow whose wardrobe is more extensive than the explanation of the formula explaining an event horizon or a hipster who looks poor, but lives off daddy and mommy (though they'll never admit it) you shouldn't and really won't be able to afford this place...but why would you want to?\n\nI'll stick with Trader Joe's for my alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees with edges that are a little rough to ones with pants so tight, I can see their junk."
"1","I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.\n\nYou pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.\n\nI'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.\n\nUpon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience."
"2","This review is for the buffet at Whole Foods. Overall, it is good, and there are lots of great options. The food seems fresh and it is a good place to get a quick, healthy lunch on-the-go. I went with a friend and we spent a little over $20 on lunch for the 2 of us, which seems a little high for what it is, but I think we must have just gotten a lot of food because $7.99/lb is fair. Plus it is hard to get lunch for any less than that these days without eating fast food."
"1","I'll be honest, I just don't get it.  When it comes to eating I do not adhere to any particular mantra or dietary restriction like vegan, organic, vegetarian, ethical, etc.  If it's edible and it's within my palate's liking range then I eat it.\n\nFrom that perspective this place just gets two stars.  Some items were higher priced but the value added (from organic to vegan certified) would I guess justify it if you had to have it.  But the items that do no fall under any of those premium-restriction value types are still just as highly priced.  So it feels like 90% of their inventory is priced at a whole-store experience premium.\n\nTheir prepared meals section was marvelous, and their cut fruit section was like I had died and gone to heaven.  But that's about the only two sections I probably would have been willing to open up my wallet."
"2","Now with two new bee hives along the rail line as of July 2012 managed by burgh bees of Pittsburgh"
"1","I loved it, parking and all, after all, they had Palak Paneer! Mmmmm. It was tasty. I spent a lot, but I was ok with the occasional splurge. the second trip, i again bought my hit foods Palak Paneer and it had obviously gone over. \n\nEver have whoopsies after green Indian cuisine?\n\nIt's off my list now. Forever."
"1","I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience, which is ridiculously horrible at this location - very poorly planned. And then, there's the prices - Giant Eagle being quite expensive compared to similar grocers in other cities, Whole Foods obviously has to get a one up on those; it's inherent in the scheme of selling premium \""natural\"" goods. Whole Foods does have better lighting and layout than GE, and yes, a more discriminative selection of products, especially for people with specialized diets, like vegans (me) and gluten free adherents. The house baked bread here might be worse than GE (tough contest) - often under baked and thus soggy in middle and crusts tend to fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need to talk about customer demographics, because you've all seen Rachel C.'s link!"
"2","All that I can say is WOWSA!!!!!!!!! This review is long overdue! I will state it outright that I'm very particular about my food, and I've been known to stomp my food like a brat when my heart's set on that vegan tofu burrito from the fresh pack section and it's not available. \n\nA few months ago, when this happened, I sulked at the Prepared Foods counter, and Bethany, prepared foods customer service extraordinaire, flew to my rescue. She suggested the vegan BLT. I was hesitant, as I wanted something hearty and filling, and let me tell you this!... The sandwich totally did her smile and sales pitch justice. It pleased me like no other sandwich has ever done. I want to compliment every sandwich maker in that department, specifically Bethany, Eric, and Rick. They know when I walk in their direction from the Fresh Pack section that I'm looking for my second option of the BLT because the burrito isn't available. No matter how bananas and certifiably insane I might seem during my food shopping excursions, they always treat me with such dignity and respect.\n\nMonths have passed since my first BLT experience, and I was completely taken for another ride through satisfaction land during this past week when they offered to notify me \""the night before when the vegan tofu burritos are being made\"" because they know how much I have my heart set on that beautiful meal on most days of the week. I can't say enough for Bethany and her team of prepared foods colleagues. \n\nAnd everyone else at the store is so helpful and nice, too! So kind! So informative! I love Whole Foods Market of Pittsburgh! AND, for icing on the review cake, they've even begun to carry Brad's Raw Pizza Kale Chips for dogs. So my dog is satisfied, too. And it's her opinion that ultimately matters. ;) Five stars! Thank you!!!!!!!!!"
"2","I love Whole Foods, and I have been a fan for a few years now. I've visited Whole Foods locations around the country, but this Pittsburgh location is one of my favorites. It's a small store, but it feels homey and comfortable.\n\nStaff: Most of the staff members are super friendly and willing to do just about anything to help you find what you are looking for. I had one staff member begrudgingly help me out, but I assumed he was having a bad day or was very busy. Either way, it's nice to treat others with respect. \n\nThe cashiers here are so fantastic. They are never rushing and throwing food into bags. They take their time, ask you questions and treat you like a person instead of another number in a long line. \n\nDeli/Made-To-Order: The deli and made-to-order foods are currently my favorite. Sometimes I would rather spend $20 on lunch here with my boyfriend than go to a restaurant or get fast food. My favorite is the vegan chicken salad on foccacia bread. I adore this bread. It's just the right texture, it's nice and herby and deliciously buttery. Topped with swiss or muenster, it's a super delish sandwich. If I am extra peckish, I get extra veg. chicken salad. Yum yum yum! \n\nThe tomato bisque they have is something I newly tried. I'm very picky about my tomatoes and tomato products. This soup delivers. I wish I could have it every single day. It's so phenomenal! My boyfriend got it today alongside a cheddar biscuit that paired beautifully with the soup. \n\nCheeses: If you want fancy gourmet cheeses, the Whole Foods deli counter might be the best choice. We purchased a small amount of Midnight Moon Goat Cheese Gouda and made the most expensively delicious grilled cheese sandwich. We're grown-ups now, say goodbye to gross American cheeses! The cheese counter is so great because all of the cheeses are labeled with the kind of rennet used in the processing. You can easily find a high-quality vegetarian cheese with just a glance. The cheese experts are also willing to talk cheese to you for as long as you like. \n\nStore Selection: Overall the store has great options, but they don't carry everything that I wish they did. Unfortunately, they discontinued one of my favorite products - Field Roast Deli Slices. They bring in new and trendy foodstuffs though, so it's enough to keep me happy. \n\nWhole Foods can be pretty expensive, but if you don't fall for the tempting packaged foods, you can get away with a reasonable grocery bill! I primarily shop here for special items though. \n\nP.S. Their selection of natural body and haircare is great and affordable. If you have sensitive skin or don't want your products tested on animals, go here!"
"2","Yes, the parking lot in crazy. Yes, the prices are outrageously high (it's not called Whole Paychecks for nuthin'). Yes, the store is small and usually crowded and the majority of the people who shop who here completely unaware they are NOT the only people on the planet. All those things aside, I love Whole Foods. Most of the issues can be handled by slight changes in habit. For instance, park farther away instead of circling the GD parking lot for the closest spot!!! I get so sick of people complaining about that damn parking lot when all you have to do is park by Walgreens and walk. Seriously, the walk won't kill most of us. Stop being lazy. (Sorry, for the tirade; that's a pet peeve of mine). \n\nThe produce is fantastic, always. And not just the organic stuff either. The regular pesticide-laden produce is great. The quality of the meat department is second to none. Now, the bakery is a little 'Eh' for me. The muffins and cookies and cakes always look De-Lish!, but they aren't. Usually to dry or dense or flavorless. It really doesn't matter because the star of the show is...\n\nThe HOT FOODS BAR. The quality and taste of most of the hot foods/prepared foods bar is unbeatable. I lovelvoelove the breakfast bar. My dream weekend starts with waking up and taking a nice long walk, stopping for coffee then heading on to WF to pick up Eggs Rancheros Burritos and Sausage patties from the breakfast bar. I may get creamed by a bus the second I leave, but I will die happy. \n\nSome of my other favorites are a Vegan General Tso's \""chicken\"" that has the BEST real chicken texture. It's really good! The mozzarella pasta salad, Sicilian cauliflower and the egg rolls which are seasonal. Don't forget to check out the packaged hot foods across from the salad bar; same stuff but pre-packaged. \n\nAs a note though, the chicken fiesta soup is nooooot good. Bland with a capital B! In general the soups are hit or miss, but a real hit is the triple squash or Butternut squash, something like that. It's next to sushi. It's very good"
"2","I don't shop at Whole Foods that often since it isn't that close to me. There's a Shop n Save a block from my house, so I buy most of my food there.\n\nOne thing about Whole Foods is they specialize in fresh fruits and vegetables.  Their produce is definitely impressive. All of the oranges, lettuce, berries and bananas peppers are perfectly ripe.  They never have spoiled or bad fruit.\n\nThe pastry section is definitely worth checking out.  They have fruit tarts and a lot of different flavored cheesecakes and cannolis.\n\nWhole Foods seems more expensive than Aldi but less expensive than Giant Eagle."
"2","As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. Not this \""conventional\"" garbage. Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. Staff is always friendly and helpful."
"2","Alright, so I braved this place yesterday (new years eve) and it was totally insane. There was honking, some road rage and confusion. But I will say that I should have known better coming into a grocery store before a major partying holiday.  \n\nAnyway, in terms of produce this place is awesome. I got my meat and bacon from this joint and have not been disappointed. I also love their premade hamburgers. They are delish. This is also a great place to find a great assortment of cheeses and grass fed butter ( I go for the kerry gold products, they are just awesome).  \n\nAlso if you are grilling and dont want to cook too many sides, you can pick up some of their sides from their deli section. I haven't had a bad experience with their food and you can always give everything a taste before having the clerk put it in a container.  This is certainly the place to get specialty items like hemp seeds, chia seeds, and other natural dietary supplements... just beware they are not cheap. Overall, whole foods is not cheap, but if you want quality this is the place to go. Just dont go here on New Year's Eve or Christmas Eve... you'll end up ripping your hair out!!"
"2","I love going here, if you shop smart it really isn't your whole paycheck and is less expensive than other options in the area (Market District I'm looking at you). I only buy the store brand unless I need something special for a recipe, and my bill is consistently less than anything I bought at Market District. The quality of the produce and the meat cannot be matched anywhere in the city, unless you go down to the Strip. But hands down my favorite thing about going here are the employees. If you read anything about the corporate structure or culture of Whole Foods you'll understand why everyone seems so happy to be working. I have never had a request met with anything less than a smile, and I love that they are willing to let you try a new product before committing to the whole purchase."
"1","If I could give them zero stars, I would. Awful! My car wouldn't start so I called the tow and he managed to get it started, but it's been acting up so I brought it in anyways. After having my car for an entire week and not calling me once, after I've called twice, the man on the phone told me it was ready to pick up, nothing wrong with it. When I went to pick it up, I turned it on and before I could even leave the lot, it died! I went back in and told him that the tow truck operator hooked it up to a jumper box and pumped the gas to start it. That's what he did. Then told me it probably didn't start because it was sitting so long. Then he told me \""I don't know anything about your car\""! I left and sure enough had trouble getting it started at my next destination, had to pump the gas pedal. Yeah, that sounds like \""nothing's wrong\"". DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE. THEY ADMITTEDLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CARS!"
"2","I'm torn!  If I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 5.0 I would, but I can't quite do 5 because I've been to other Pittsburgh facilities that have better court facilities and my own home courts out West didn't get a 5, so I can't be accused of bias, haha.\n\nPITC is just that, the Pittsburgh indoor tennis club.  It is conveniently (for Shadyside and surrounding areas) located in the East Liberty area, very close to Target, PetSmart, and Pizza Sola.\n\nThere's five courts, four full courts and one singles-only court.  They play faster than average with a low bounce unless you're a heavy top-spin hitter.  They're definitely kept in good condition and for an indoor facility that seems to be older in age the lighting is quite good.\n\nI did their two hour clinic on Sunday afternoon after playing a USTA match there and I can definitely say it is a great great great value.  You get an excellent workout and the teacher during the clinic actually gives your pointers and provides remarks on your game.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to trying out more of their clinics in the future."
"1","This club is now officially closed for good due to redevelopment in the area."
"2","You can see their second bar through the front windows.  I always assumed that that was their first bar, and just walked by the place maybe a hundred times, until walking in and noticing that everyone was drinking in a different bar.\n\nIn other words, this place is *huge* inside.  The place looks like it was decorated about the same time many other cities built up chinatown areas; I like the decor, even if it might be slightly dated.  \n\nChinese and Korean food, at or above my expectations.  The stuff on the menu is good, and they're willing to put together things that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely.  Kung pao tofu is my favorite so far."
"1","Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.\n\nHot & Sour soup was highly americanized, not very hot or very sour.\nWonton Soup was a very large portion and good.\n\nEgg Rolls were large, slightly greasy but the filling was flavorless, not very good.\nCheese wonton's were okay but the old grease used to fry them in over-powered the flavor.\nChinese Flank steak was tough and chewy in a soy style sauce thickened with cornstarch, a little too salty and greasy but overall it was good.\nFlaming chicken was chicken breast with sugar peas, bamboo shoots and baby corn in a white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, that lacked much of any flavor except slat - it was just okay.\n\nTea tasted like American Lipton brewed in large quantities in the back than served in a generic tea-pot.\n\nThe place was clean service was good, prices are very good, but the food was just average."
"1","I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First, it's not about the service, price, decor, or the food.  I'm writing this review after going there twice.  The first time my husband and I went, the dinner was good.  We thought this place has the potential to be our go-to Chinese restaurant in Pgh.  Today I remembered that they have an early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat).  The won ton soup was not authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) but wasn't bad.  The entree was fine.  \n\nWhat really knocked the score down to 1 is the awful tobacco/cigarette smell from the tea!! ? !!   I had to go to the grocery store and buy a pack of gum.  The smell wouldn't leave me so I came home to rinse my mouth with Listerine (2-3 minutes) then brush (as long as I could) to get rid of the smell.  Did they use the tea pot as an ash tray?  \n\n[first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]"
"1","Hey, Jimmy! Cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags! The early bird special is cheaper because it is mostly cabbage and the tea tastes like second-hand smoke.\nI had the same dish previously, without the special and it was fine (hence 2 stars and not 1). I'm going to avoid this place until I get a craving to drink tobacco."
"1","Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected."
"2","Best chiropractic center I been to others Dr Novak and staff are the best in the Pittsburgh area they are concerned and problems always taken care of excellent adjustments  I always feel better after I leave there"
"2","As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant."
"2","I went to Casbah for brunch, it's a $22 prix-fix, which includes an alcoholic bev, an appetizer and an entree. They use amazingly fresh and yummy fruits and veggies. I had the house made granola which was just amazing! Toasty and sweet, it was nothing like the granola you get out of a box. Also, while the food is totally fru-fru (in only the best way :) and it's a pricey brunch, you get a lot a food. After the great pastry basket, my appetizer, a Bellini and a cup of coffee, I had two bites of my omelette and took the rest in a doggy bag (\""the rest\"" included fruit salad, potatoes, and a croissant!)\n\nMy only complaint would be how long everything took. While I love a leisurely meal, an hour and a half for brunch seemed a bit excessive. I go into brunch groggy, then I have coffee and yummy food, and I'm totally amped, ready to face the day! And then I get to sit. And wait. Anyway, it's totally not a big deal, now I'll know to make time the next time I go. Which is for dinner for a friends birthday. So excited!!"
"2","Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...\n\nService was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection."
"2","Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.\n\nThe three dinning rooms, \""outside,\"" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.\n\nThe food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.\n\nThe wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it."
"2","I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here.\n\nThe food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty! \n\nDecor is subtle and great for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating.  I will most definitely return!"
"2","There is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. That said, I had the best pork chop I've ever had here and for that I was endlessly thankful. Good salad, delicious bread and hummus. Great service. For Pittsburgh, top notch."
"2","This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. \n\nGotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. \n\nWhat I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a \""Mediterranean\"" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on. \n\nI do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!\n\nSo pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!"
"2","Excellent place for brunch.  For $22, I had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  Service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  Reservations available through Open Table.  This is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable."
"2","Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.\n\nCasbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.\n\nThe smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.\n\nMy entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.\n\nService was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching."
"1","I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...\n\nI made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts, slightly preferable to the inner cheap.trendy.interiors.com shit. Have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders? Probably not, as the ladies room is a very dim place; don't expect to be able to notice that your botox implant is crooked. Anyway, It was HOT under the Space-Ray heater on the patio, making for a sweaty and ice-instantly-melted beverage winter night. The food was alright with some interesting flavor pairings, but it was certainly not quite worth the price. The bread was the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Our server made it seem that everything she was doing was somebody else's job, in fact, it was mostly other people who delivered, which made it confusing in terms of knowing who to ask for things and whether or not to factor some of the fine service into the tip that presumably goes mostly to the primary server who was sub-par for upscale dining; our question for the kitchen left unanswered, \""the host is supposed to do that but I will...\"" Run on. When I described the qualities I was looking for in my wine choice during beverage inquiry, she just stared blankly and waited for me to decide. The wine list did not include descriptions. The gal who delivered the wine thankfully did describe it before popping the top and it was determined that I did not want this cheapest option before me! She described another bubbly that sounded and was, according to my own tastes, delightful. \n\nI was so very satisfied with the sparkling sensation of the meal that I sought it out at the Wine and Spirits store. This was the moment that my minor disappointment in the value of my special-occasion dinner at Casbah turned into a feeling of devastating violation. I am talking about a 400% markup on the retail price of this wine. If you want to do your own math: at Casbah the 1/2 bottle of Gruet Blanc Du Noirs cost $35, while a WHOLE bottle at W&S is priced at $16.99. You can bet that I will choose to enjoy this wine elsewhere, like Avenue B (byob), next time. \n\nCasbah is lacking the quality service, honesty and original ambiance that should accompany creative food at moderately high prices.\n\n**Update: I recently saw a full size bottle of the Gruet on a restaurant menu for $30; Casbah, take a tip!"
"2","Went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a Sunday. Anyway, we got the Brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! Yum. We sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines. \n\nFor my 2 courses I got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. IT was honestly, amazing. I loved it. It came with some almonds and some cranberries, but the polenta itself was great. I would come back just to have that for breakfast. For the main dish i got a crab omelette. It came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. The potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. Not the best I have had, but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.\n\nIt was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. This place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax."
"1","For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.\n\nWhen our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.\n\nWaiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.\n\nFinished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \""right out.\""  While I guess she didn't define \""right out,\"" what this actually meant was \""in 25 minutes.\""  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory m\u00e9lange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.\n\nVastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.\n\nFor my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \""Mac and Cheese\"", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.\n\nCompleting our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \""just the bill.\""\n\nSettling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \""I hope you will join us again.\"" I will not."
"2","Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).\n\nI had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).\n\nThe atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe)."
"2","I ate here for brunch on Sunday.  It's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  It included a mimosa/bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate.  I had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  All was great.  They could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  The bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be returning for brunch!"
"2","great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.\n\ncasbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy."
"1","Disappointing. \n\nMy bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.\n\nWe ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.\n\nThe waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it."
"1","Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile."
"1","I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food. \n\nThe outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds."
"2","Of the Big Burrito group restaurants Casbah is the one that has never failed us.  Consistent and delicious with great flavors of the mediterrean.  \n\nAll of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature Arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  Crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.\n\nSpecial occasions or hungry on a week night... casbah is a great stop"
"2","My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.  \n\nThe food is great (I highly recommend the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli), the drinks are wonderful (I am a sucker for good Sangria - and Casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding (our servers are always friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable)."
"2","Out of towners that happened to stumble upon this gem. Thanks, Siri. Wow! What a great experience. Fantastic, wine, food and service."
"2","So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!)."
"2","Very expensive for a college student, but quite good.\nI would recommend this if you enjoy European food in general."
"2","This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area."
"2","Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss."
"1","1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!\n2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.\n3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!\n Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!"
"2","Ate lunch at Casbah for the first time. Tried the Piccolo Gusto: $15 gets you a small choice of salad, a half sandwich and a half portion of a pasta or risotto. Great deal and fantastic food. Argula salad, shodt rib sandwich and wild mishroom/truffle risotto. No need for dinner today!"
"2","Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?\n\nThey altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.\n\nService was attentive and the setting nice."
"1","Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \n\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \n\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \n\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \n\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \n\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \n\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag."
"2","Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality is hard to find period.  Very progressive menu but not too wild, products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  And butter served at the right temperature, that's a novel idea!  Just a great experience, can't wait to get back there."
"2","In my opinion, Casbah is the best of the big burrito restaurants. I have been to Casbah for dinner and drinks a few times. During my latest experience, I was impressed by the hearty fall entrees. I decided to take my husband to Casbah for his birthday on friday night. I called on Monday and luckily, I was able get a reservation without a problem. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. We were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area. \n\nWe decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs. This was my favorite part of the meal. I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal. \n\nIf you are looking for a place to enjoy good wine, amazing food and a pleasant atmosphere, Casbah is for you."
"2","Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!"
"1","For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \""yes, it's got lemon in it.\"" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \""yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\"" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \n\nAlso, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there."
"2","It's a little pricier than most places in the area but the quality and ambiance is well worth it.    The food was really good and the drinks were relatively reasonably priced for the surroundings,  great place to take a date...or spouse."
"2","Wonderful brunch and good dinner. The service obviously prides itself on being super proper (choreographed plate delivery, polite to the point of almost sappy attitude on the part of the waiters) and it can be a little bit annoying even. However, this is the probably the classiest of the Big Burrito restaurants, so if you're looking for that, this place is great. Extensive, yet expensive, wine menu. Small-ish portions and a very pleasant covered heated patio."
"2","Went here for bruch and had their take on the classic eggs benedict.  I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and this was very good.  I opted for the prociuto as the meat option and I'm glad I did.  It gave the eggs enough flavor without having to add extra salt.  \n\nThe potatoes were perfectly cooked and the fruit was tasty as well.  Had the bellini and didn't realize how I much I would enjoy it so I had two!"
"2","- Great food. I had the Gerber's Amish Farm Chicken Breast and it was cooked perfectly and delicious =]\n- Nice wine selection. Though I'm a beer guy.\n- Friendly staff.\n- Okay atmosphere.\n\nThis place is definitely worth trying. Will be back for seconds!"
"2","My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.\n\nFirst, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert. \n\nOur bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time!"
"2","Brought my wife here for her birthday and we were lucky enough to arrive on the last of three nights of the truffle dinner. I saw it online before I arrived and dismissed it, but our server (Amanda) sold us on it when we got there. In fact, her thorough and enthusiastic descriptions of each course (including each cocktail and cheese) were a highlight of the meal. Sometimes over the top (\""people say it's the best meal they have had in their life\"" and \""the chef took this week off so he could enjoy the meal as a customer--and it brought a tear to his eye\"") but we genuinely loved it. \n\nFirst, she made excellent suggestions on the cocktail (mimosa) and she helped us decide on the rest of the meal. Her recommendation to split the truffle dinner and add an appetizer was perfect. We left completely satisfied. \n\nThe cheese was very good and the accoutrements well-paired. When I saw it on the plate, I didn't think it was very much but it ended up being the perfect amount. I also appreciated that they kept the bread coming, especially for the next course: a homemade pasta with pancetta, arugula and"
"1","Good food, great service, but high prices.\n\nMy date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.\n\nWe were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.\n\nMake sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.\n\nAlthough I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants."
"1","Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!"
"2","A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!"
"1","Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short, the restaurant itself was nice and the food interesting though a little on the pricey side. Service started out great but for some reason our entrees took forever and our waiter more or less abandoned us. If I'm spending a $150 on dinner for 2 I expect some sort of explanation on why we are having to wait 45 minutes plus between our appetizer and the entrees. At a minimum, I don't want to have to flag down the server to order another drink and for god's sake don't make me ask for a refill of my water.  If I was only basing my decision on food I'd probably go back but all things considered there are too many other restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can get amazing food AND an amazing dining experience."
"2","I've been to this restaurant with my husband twice, once for dinner before I moved to Pittsburgh, and once for brunch a few months ago, and both were great meals. When I went for dinner they accidentally threw away my doggy-bag instead of giving it to me, but they offered to make me a new order, so it worked out fine. When we went for brunch it was quite crowded and we had to wait a while before getting seats at the bar. The food is really fantastic though and there are good vegetarian options. It's pricey, but worth it if you're celebrating a special occasion. Seems like it would be perfect if you're looking for a romantic place to impress a date."
"2","This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah."
"2","I am so happy they got rid of those awful bar stools!!!   We often choose not to walk in to Casbah without a reservation because the bar area was historically uncomfortable.  They have traded out the old stools that were screwed in to the floor, too far from your companions, and didn't comfortably turn to face people (who thought that was a good idea?) in for some admittedly less attractive but functional chairs,  I'm a big fan of the lunch and dinner there--we'll add that more often to our walk-in list now,"
"2","Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. \n\nThe calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! \n\nThe pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal. \n\nI like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon."
"2","Lovely, relaxing atmosphere. The cauliflower soup with tarragon emulsion was fabulous, as was the tomato basil soup. The waiter was attentive and happily allowed for a substitution on my salad so I could try one of the raw milk cheeses from their cheese sampler. The grilled chicken breast on my salad was a bit more dry and hard than I like, but I am not a big fan of barbecuing chicken and it certainly seemed to have been charred that way. If the chicken had been moist, this place would get all five stars from me!"
"2","So I'm a lowkey snob when it comes to going to nice restaurants and though a lot of places charge an arm and a leg, are overrated, and are just not up to par with what I'm used to coming from Sf and La. With that said, casbah was a nice little taste of home for me.  It had really fresh ingredients and a nice selection of wines to go with. We started with a cheese trio with was paired well with different preserves and chutneys.  We then had roasted octopus and the scallops.   The scallops for me were very interesting and a little too sweet for my taste with the pear and lacked texural components.  However the octopus has a real nice char, and was full of great well rounded flavors.  For our entrees, my bf got the duck which was underseasoned, and the fat was jot rendered out correctly.  The skin was also burnt.  The sides and vegetbales of the dish were seasoned and cooked beautifully though.  I had the lamb loin and it was perfectlh medium rare with delicious bitter greens.  I honestly loved every part of my entree and the red wines we selected went well with the meal. \n\nAll in all it was a delicious meal and a really nice environment.  And worth the money."
"2","A taste of CA in PA.  \n\nWe walked in and I would swear I was in Santa Monica or Hermosa  beach.  Great atmosphere- creative menu and delicious food.  The steak was to die for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.  \n\nThey also have a nice wine list.  The French Chardonnay was quite good!\n\nThanks for making me feel at home."
"2","My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place."
"2","The rave reviews I'd heard for Casbah were so over the top, I thought it would be impossible to live up to.   Casbah has exceeded it's sky high expectations and made me a believer!  We got the brunch and while the $24 pre-fix menu isn't cheap, it actually felt like a steal because the ambiance, decor, friendly attentive staff, and generous portions of delicious, inventive food were all so fantastic!  \n\nThe brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails, appetizer, entree, and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones.  I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home!\n\nWe all got different things and there wasn't a single bite of anything that we didn't love.  I particularly recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong.  \n\nThe decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots.  We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim.  Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city  because you get so much for your money.  I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience."
"1","Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water, were provided a refill but no offer to acquire other beverages. With plenty of time to review the night's menu, we made our selection. My request was well done Salmon (heart issues require well done) the chef's feelings were clear; as I sawed through the salmon I thought it could possibly be a message. I again had offended by my request. I like Casbah and the other BB restaurants but tonight I should have selected a friendlier more customer focused establishment. YES I will return and still recommend Casbah. Oh we did finally get to place a cocktail order.  \nM"
"2","Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.\n\nGood service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.\n\nWhile the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.\n\nAs with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!"
"2","The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house.  I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed. \n\nFast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did!  The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.  My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied.  So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again.  I'm so very glad I did!\n\nP.S. Bring your coat into the restroom. It was about 10 below in there. Brrr!"
"2","I've eaten at Casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch, everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite, helpful recommendations, and my glass is never empty. I continue to think that the Piccola Gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options, but I would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel, so good they're worth a star all by themselves."
"2","We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy, no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. \nService was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections. \nWe started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. \nI also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. \nDessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit). \nValet parking is complimentary; please tip your driver!"
"2","Had dinner tonight at the bar.  My sister and I wore sweatpants and flip flops... Nobody treated us differently .. The brought out bread with butter and a second butter made from goat milk.. I liked it .. My sister said it reminded her of cream cheese.. We shared the calamari ... It was good... I had the halibut... It was good accompanied with a salad.. My sister had the duck.. I didn't like the duck that much but I am not a big fan of duck to begin with .. We each had wine ... I had the falanghina .. It was perfect.. We shared a bread pudding for dessert.. It was the first time I ever had bread pudding... It like it .. It is a nice quiet restaurant with ample seating both inside and outside..."
"2","I recommend the short rib ravioli! Totally the best thing I've had in a long time."
"2","The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!\n\nFor my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!\n\nI had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.\n\nAnd the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!"
"1","Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. \n\nI immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. \n\nI started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. \n\nFor the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.\n\nFor the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.\n\nThe cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. \n\nLastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. \n\nService was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent. \n\nThis place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price."
"2","This used to be my all time favorite restaurant for dinner in Pittsburgh. The food is always top notch - lunch, dinner and brunch. \n\nI think for brunch they offer one of the best bloody Mary's in the city, with just the right amount of kick! My favorite dinner entree was the casericcia - not sure if I spelled it correctly. Why did they ever remove it from the menu is anyone's guess. It was amazing. I went there for my birthday dinner and was ready to order it when the waiter explained that they removed it from the menu despite it being one of their most popular dishes. What a total let down. Nothing compares to it in my book. That's the only reason I'm giving Casbah a 4 star review... \n\nPlease please please bring it back!!"
"1","While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.  \n\nWhen my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate. \n\nFirst off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.\n\nin my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu. \n\nI'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat. \n\nFor me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!"
"1","Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?"
"2","At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits:\n\nFirst time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.\n\nSecond time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!\n\nThird time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014)\n. I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.\n\nAll in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!"
"2","Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh?  YES!  great music, friendly accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor\n\nCons: Not a convenient location for the car-less me, but well that's just me\n\nHi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list of non-alcoholic drinks.  Granted, Quiet Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't have an alcohol license and has to make do.  Ginger lemonade?  Yes.  All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  Yeah!\n\nI do love my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty good (albeit dry but I attribute that to my love of meaty things).  They used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  Too bad most of Pittsburgh doesn't really learn to love culture.\n\nUsually good music acts here.  Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends.  Usually 2-3 acts play.  Live.  And it's nice that there aren't many of us because we can sit up close.  And be sure to kick the friend who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  \n\nThe bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.\n\nI have never been here during the daytime so I can't comment on that.  Always great service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  There are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers."
"1","It's good when they are on, but they are so inconsistent you never know what you are going to get.  The coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.  Generally, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are in the neighborhood and desperately hungry--you MIGHT catch a lucky break and be there on a good day."
"1","Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\n\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce."
"2","Fun, unique atmosphere (hippie / indy / hipster / whatever these kids are calling it these days). Interesting, tasty food. Above all, awesome retro decor. A Pittsburgh treasure."
"2","A cool (if mildly painfully hipster-ish) decor; perfect settingfora Sunday brunch. The service was great, the food was both satisfying and healthy, and the milkshake I had to top off my omelet was deeeeelicious. Are all of their milkshakes vegan? Because ifthey are, I was completely fooled. A little more than I was hoping to pay for a breakfast dish but I suppose I can't complain, as it was morethan enough to hold me through until dinner. (I agree with the comment I saw that stated that this would be a perfect place for a hungover posse!)"
"2","I eat at this place at least once a week.  No longer cash only, which is nice since I never have any.  As a vegan I like that I have a ton of options here, but that my meat-eating boyfriend is happy too.  Food is a little pricey and if you get more than an entree and coffee it's easy to quickly rack up quite a bill for such a modest seeming place.  My only real complaint is the inconsistency of the service.  It's totally hit or miss.  I've never felt targeted with \""attitude,\"" but I have experienced long waits for the menu, coffee, water, the check - but weirdly, never the food. Most of the time I leave happy, sometimes irritated, but I'm always full and ready for a nap."
"1","Maybe I am just the most jaded vegan in town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores me to tears, that which I will use to salt my own mediocre cooking at home! Their coffee isn't all that great either, as given the choice, local La Prima is in my favor. Tears. This is the only vegetarian restaurant on the East side of town, and oh so close to me, but I cannot stand to go there. Desperate times now call for toast and tea served by the sad server that resides within my depressed little dining room."
"2","This space is so beautiful.\n\ni'm always a sucker for big windows all across the front, but here especially the huge windows and wide building front really opens up the space and provides excellent lighting for the front half of the cafe.\n\nThe layout is unique, with the island, counter, and bar stools in the center and plenty of tables all around. It really provides a lot of opportunities for unique corners to sit in alone and lots of space for groups.\n\nThe coffee is decent. It's made from Dean's Beans, decent fair-trade coffee and brewed to a consistent perfection. i can't speak to lattes and espressos because i've never tried them, even though QS supposedly just got in a new espresso machine.\n\nThe food is so-so, decent vegetarian fare, with the exception of most of the tofu dishes, which are spectacular.\n\nAnd the milkshakes are always a good time, even if they're a bit on the expensive side.\n\nCash-only if total is under $10.\n\nContrary to what some others have said, this isn't a hipster hangout. The customers seem to be a nice mix between students, locals, and artists. This isn't an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink.\n\nAnd it does a pretty fucking good job of it."
"1","I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep finding myself hungrily returning to the Quiet Storm. The menu has slightly changed, and they are no longer cash only... This time it was the \""8th Ward\"" that inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure what 8th Ward is supposed to mean, but I will forever associate it with a dry boring place. And I thought we were getting a party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I am near positive that they forgot to add garlic, lemon, salt and tahini to this chickpea paste that which was described as \""garlicky\"" on the menu. Sooo wrong. \""The Butter,\"" another WTF of a name, was also very dry and bland. The salsa was good! And there were plenty of dipping accessories, too many really, given the smallness of the unappetizing dip portions.\n\nAt this point, I've tried most of the vegan options QS has to offer and the only luck I've had has been with the B.Y.O.B. Go figure. \n\nI wouldn't care so much about how much of a tease this place is if I didn't REALLY desire a comfortable neighborhood place to eat comfortable food with a comfortable view of a cute waitress who writes fiction. And it frustrates me that few others seem to recognize the culinary (I shutter at even calling it that) mediocrity of \""the best\"" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh has to offer."
"2","Very few people name the places depending on how the place is going to look like from the City's perspective.Confused??\nI bet half of Pittsburgh students didn't notice this amazing vegan place,it is like a quiet storm ;just there but not really.Now i am confused!! :)\n\n  Straight to the point -this place is huge and neat and they have a huge cafe bar with great food list.i ordered thai salad with vegan chicken and tempeh and my friends ordered wraps.It was simply delicious and i was extremely excited that i discovered this place after a long Vegan research.\n\n The place was definitely quiet and shockingly even the area around the place was dead.Maybe they have some historical reasons to name it Quiet storm like there was a light storm and everyone left the place...ahmm..I shall stop my list of lame reasons,such that you could stop reading and would be able to chase the quiet storm :)\n\n-Smriti"
"1","Well, I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak, perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus, wow, definitely the worst; tasted like paste. Yuck with a capital whY. I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant, but since I do not plan to return, I guess methinks not."
"1","i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however, i have visited multiple times now continuously hoping for improvement and each time i've been disappointed.  let's start with the good things.  QS has a great atmosphere, it definitely helped the transition from austin.  very chill \""hippie\"" vibe.  however, the servers although friendly can  sometimes be a touch \""hippie-elitest\"".  the food was alright.  their homefries were quite tasty but little else has tantalized my taste buds and i have tried many things.  i do love their thai dressing, very yummy on the salads.  will i continue to go back?  probably, wishful thinking is  a good thing."
"2","For vegetarian food in Pgh this place is hard to beat. The quality of the food is very good, but the kitchen tends to be slow so bring a friend/book/deck of cards, and the serving sizes are somewhat inconsistent. The coffee drinks are OK, but I don't come here for those. I love the atmosphere of this place, very laid back, cozy, inviting. My favorite eats are the soups and the pile-o-hashbrowns (think haystack without the artery clogging gravy)."
"2","YUMMM.  Read the Yelp reviews before coming, so I knew to get the ginger lemonade and hangover hash.  Both were amazing, filling, AND i got to use the wifi there for a couple hours on a Sunday morning with no nasty looks from the staff (it was crowded but no line).  Totally worth any effort it takes to get there (seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, I had a couple mile walk to get there.)"
"2","We go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. It's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). My bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  Homefries with tofu instead of eggs. The waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet, you may find yourself disappointed.\n\nOn cold wintery days try a Mexican Hot Chocolate - it will surely warm your heart!"
"1","I'm going to revise my review of Quiet Storm.\n\nYou may get lucky and find yourself faced with an awesome rendering of a fabulously-designed vegetarian sandwich. In my experience, however (considering the 30+ Cubanos I've eaten there), you're more likely to get a sad, mediocre rendition.\n\nConsistency is not their strong point.\n\nAdd to that the likelihood that you may be dosed with some surly owner attitude, and I've decided to steer clear.\n\nIt's a shame that I no longer feel it's worth it to chase the beautiful dream of my first meals at Quiet Storm. It's also a shame that many of their staff are wonderful, friendly, and helpful, and yet their efforts are overshadowed.\n\nSorry, Quiet Storm. As a Pittsburgh vegetarian, I want to love you. But you broke my heart."
"2","Quiet Storm truly is a wonderful neighborhood gem. Surrounded by a desolate urban landscape, I never would've expected this colorful, creative coffee shop to have such impressive food.\n\nMy dinner here consisted of an apple panini and a \""shampoo\"", a strange (but delicious!) cherry and almond cream soda. It very well might have taken me 20 minutes or more simply to decide on my beverage of choice - their list was not only long, but offered more innovative choices than I could have ever dreamt up. Among them, an impressive array of Italian sodas (lavender & lemon, mango & lime, white choc & mint, etc.), an enticing selection of lemonades (ginger lemonade, lavender lemonade), and some excellent-sounding tea combinations. To top it off, almost all flavors were available in the form of vegan milkshakes. How they concocted all of these culinary ideas is absolutely beyond me. (I apologize to the coffee drinkers. As a tea drinker myself, I hardly paid attention to that half of the menu.)\n\nThe apple panini I ordered came out quickly and was complemented with a side of tortilla chips and salsa. My panini included granny smith apples, apple butter, sharp cheddar, cream cheese, and seisage (vegetarian sausage) atop sun-dried tomato bread (though it seemed more like raisin to me). Never in a million years would I have come up with this strange combination of flavors, but it definitely worked. As described in the menu, indeed it was \""highly addictive\"".\n\nTable service was great, nothing took too long and it seemed pleasant and casual. No overbearing waiters, no frills, etc.\n\nGiven the fact that I live about a mile away, I think they should be expecting yet another regular in the very near future."
"1","The menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland. Thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table. The best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake. The burger and \""spicy\"" Cajun soup were very mediocre."
"1","I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone, the service is awful. It's as if they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I think their breakfasts are pretty good and their lentil loaf is good but usually your sides consist of yellow nacho chips with brown jalopeno slaw. Also, the cooks look like they are lacking hygeine. the one great thing about this place is their coffee, and that's it."
"1","I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \""firesticks\"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead."
"1","Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need \""fake\"" meat, this I do not understand.  I had a primavera sandwich which was just ok, but the patty on the roll was just as perplexing as the \""mystery meat\"" you get in your elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came with a boring pasta salad and some tortilla chips out of a bag.  Otherwise the atmosphere was fun, and the wifi was free if you ask for the password."
"1","I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service, it only somehow softens the blow, but why be mediocre? \n\nThe environment is comfortable (unless you sense the servers don't want you there). The music ranges and is appropriate for the environment. It's never too loud or aggressive. Free wi-fi helps and the milkshakes are slammin! The food is inconsistent, but often good. The Black-a-dilla is my favorite. \n\nI really want to like Quiet Storm, but it only merits 2 stars. Their food, service, and hours are inconsistent. It seems they often close early. \n\nOwners, please stick to your business hours. It's not like you're open that late to begin with! Perhaps everybody wants to go home, I don't blame them for that, and you may have run out of a few things, but try to imagine the disappointment of trekking out there to enjoy your favorite shake or snack and then being turned away.  \n\nOR, If you believe this is an acceptable business practice, it would be less infuriating if you simply changed your hours to '9am - until we feel like it.'  This way there are no set expectations and we can't really begrudge you for it. \n\n...My vote is to just stick with the hours you created.\n\nThanks!"
"1","Yes, it is reasonably priced.  Yes, my food was tasty (6 on a scale of 1-10).  However, the place did not look clean to me--I won't be back because of that."
"2","Tasty horchata - dessert before the meal of veggie Cuban with smoked tempeh ... Yum!\nCool funky space with low key music & friendly waitresses with plenty of tats"
"1","Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\n\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \""look in the back\"" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\n\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place."
"2","We've figured out where all the hipsters go on the weekend for brunch!\n\nReally excellent french toast, just like my dad used to make. I had the breakfast burrito, which I thought was OK, but not something I would order again. But, more importantly than the food, we just really liked the atmosphere. Sitting there in their mismatched, vintage-y looking diner, I felt like I was in the Mission in SF (OK, maybe minus the fact that everyone was sporting their winter gear, which would never be necessary in CA). Kid friendly too, if that's important to you."
"2","Everyone I show this place to loves it. Yes it's totally hipster and funky. Yes, hipster service isn't going to walk up to you all bubbly and smiley and be super cheesy to you. But the employees are chill, and it's all about the food, milkshakes, and coffee. The rotating menu is awesome, and I've tried a lot and never gotten anything bad. The chai milkshakes are amazing, as are all of their drinks. I'm not even a vegetarian and this one of my favorite places to go over and over!"
"1","So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely.\n \nWe went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok, not stupendous, not horrible. He ordered the veggie burger, and I had the chocolate oatmeal pancakes.\n\nHis burger was unseasoned and fairly cold, my pancakes were okay...but to be honest really lacked flavor (the taste of what I imagine cardboard to be came to mind). I don't discriminate, I'm all for veggies and vegan food, but just because those are your ingredients doesn't mean you can't cook things well and add seasoning.\n\nI am intrigued to go back because the apple cheese panini sounded possibly better than what we had.  \n\nI will note that ourwaitress was very sweet and friendly, but the food was just lacking in flavor so much that it's really deterred us from going back."
"1","Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price."
"2","I decided to grab dinner on a Saturday night at Quiet Storm. It wasn't packed so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I ordered their Graham Street Tofu sandwich with their 'chorizo' soup and a shampoo soda. The Graham Street Tofu sandwich and soup were very good but the shampoo soda was interesting to say the least and wouldn't order it again. I was nervous I wouldn't get good service after reading some of the reviews but the waiter was friendly and checked in at the right times. I would definitely come back to Quiet Storm since they've got me curious about their other dishes. I also like the laid back vibe of the place, bringing me back to Forrest Gump time."
"1","Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible.  Sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish. I can't even believe that the server, let alone the  \""chef\"" thought it appropriate to serve. \n\nBrought my 2 year old along, had to get a high chair, I'm able to do this just would have been nice if asked by server if we needed one."
"2","I had about half a day to kill in Pittsburgh, and this is where I ended up. Traveling with food restrictions for any reason can be quite difficult these days, and Quiet Storm was a sanctuary for me to just sit down and have an awesome, vegan meal without worry of going into anaphylaxis.\n\nI had a bowl of something-something with I think tahini sauce and veggies and a huge thing of hot tea (I had laryngitis and was just very, very sick so I can't recall much other than how good my food and tea was), and my fiancee had a sandwich that came with some chips and really, really, really good salsa!\n\nThe restaurant is just down the street from the Children's Hospital and I'm just really glad my fiancee found this place so I could eat safely without worry."
"2","I've been introduced to their kale offerings and must admit, I'm a huge fan. There's a kale salad that you can ask them to put in a wrap and it's absolutely phenomenal. Almost all of their veg options are fantastic.\nThe downside of QS is their Sunday brunch. I know, I know most brunches are breakfast foods only, and this place is no exception. On a personal level, I don't really care for breakfast food for lunch and since you have no other choices, it's not my thing. \nLike I said though, this place is fantastic for veg food, so give it a try."
"1","I've found the service here to be pretty terrible. Servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences. The food is really pretty good, but if the overall service sucks, then well, it makes it hard to enjoy a tasty meal. Sorry Storm, you need to improve this."
"2","Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu."
"1","I imagine that this is the restaurant that I would make if I were 20 years old and knew nothing about restaurants except dining in them and what looks and sounds cool.  In that it does some things right, but none of the important things.  It has a decent sized shop with large windows and its bright, so that's good.  They have good music, but unfortunately we were seated right below one of what looked like two speakers in the place.  Its a large restaurant so in order to make it the right volume for people far away from the speaker it has to be too loud for the people close to the speaker.  I know the trade-offs of sound systems all too well.  If only there was a way to solve this problem like... just riffing here... more speakers at a lower volume?\n\nThey had a greatest hits of the thrift store type of decor and the standard shitty artists selling their paintings like at every coffee house you've ever been to.  They include coffee/tea/juice/whatever in the price of the brunch because, like everyone, I hate choices too and I definitely wanted at least one of those.  I'm looking at the menu and its a vegan/veggie place so we're never going to be good friends but I'd like to think that there's something that looks halfway decent but it all looks awful.  There are two Tex-Mex-Ranchero breakfast dishes... that's at least one too many; and there's only like eight choices which sounds like plenty as a number but I assure you it was not enough here.\n\nI go with the Egg Frittata as my least bad option and it ends up tasting mostly flavorless but with a distinct stale note.  It comes with a salad that is not bad, but who wants a salad for breakfast.  As we're leaving the waiter, who's been fine the whole time, asks us where we're from and my girlfriend answers \""D.C.\""  The waiter replies, \""Oh, I'm sorry about that.\""  Now, neither of us is actually born in the D.C. area, nor do I even particularly like living there.  So I'm not personally offended, but I'm not sure if someone from or living in Pittsburgh has solid footing to talk the business about Washington D.C. or almost any other large city.  Its not like property values in Pittsburgh are indicating that everyone's clammoring to live there, whereas in Washington D.C., they are.\n\nI was not enjoying the restaurant before that, but this kid actually threw me to straight up hating it.  If you're vegan and have literally no other options... then I guess you're going here.  If both of those conditions aren't true, then go anywhere else."
"1","It's cheap, I'll say that, but otherwise it's bland food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily. There are many better vegetarian and vegan options to choose from."
"1","Andrew here said it best: \""...  food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working, and when they do, only respond snarkily.\""\n\nIt took me 40 minutes to get a sandwich here, and when I complained I didn't get an apology, just a snarky remark \""well you can see we have a small kitchen\"""
"1","I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like, every time I start reading the menu I think Ashton Kutcher is going to pop out and tell me I've been Punk'd.\n\nA small disclaimer: I am not vegan or vegetarian and I never will be. I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \""Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\"" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \""chorizo\"" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \""foods.\""\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \""Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\""? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \""Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\""\n\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso. They have some really wonderful sounding tea options that I wish I could try, but I generally avoid this place because of the food."
"2","The best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh is also my neighborhood watering hole--I'm so fortunate. The food is great (especially love the ginger sunflower dish and spicy peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. You have to appreciate what they can do without meat or other animal products. The drinks are amazing.\n\nThe hipster atmosphere reminds me of Portlandia. Staff is friendly. Gets busy at brunch time on the weekends.\n\nQuiet Storm gets 4 for its food, 5 for cool factor, and 5 overall."
"1","This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud, slow, bland food and annoying service are only a few of the complaints that I have.\n \n1. The Vegan / Hipster / Metal thing has got to go. All I kept on seeing through the kitchen window was the armpit hair of the cook wearing the Mot\u00f6rhead tank top. I am a huge Mot\u00f6rhead fan, but when I go to an overpriced restaurant I don't want Lemmy to be making my food.\n \n2. The food is bland. Shoving a bunch of brown rice and black beans in a tortilla does not automatically make the food vegan and there were very few things on the menu that were 100% vegan.\n \n3. The service was pretty bad. Our appetizer came to the table with our main dish and the entire time we watched the staff eat their dinner in front of everyone at the counter. I am pretty sure that three different cooks made our order, as the cooks were tag teaming the line while they were eating.\n \n4. Last, but not least... the volume level in the place was numbing. The guy working the counter kept on slamming the ice cream freezer door every time he made a milkshake, the music was some sort of Bjork style electronica that I am pretty sure was written to induce migraines and there were about 6 hippy couples letting their kids run wild.\n \nI have been to plenty of vegetarian restaurants in my travels and Quiet Storm does not even come close to the top 10. I think Pittsburgh deserves better."
"2","I was vegan for years, vegetarian for about 9 years or so. This is a good place for those of us who are trying to eat mainly vegetarian (i.e. me now), or strict vegetarians / vegans. I like it here, but the service isn't always great. I've had a negative encounter with the manager / owner before...it was years ago so hopefully her customer service skills have grown since then.Other than that, the food has never been bad, and normally the servers are chill and nice. Don't expect to get your food on the fly."
"2","Delicious!! Not a vegetarian, but this place might convince me to switch over. Had a few breakfast options and was blown away by the Greek plate and the QTF. Excellent coffee too."
"2","Great pizza! \n\nI practically lived there when I lived in Shadyside. My favorite pizza is the Shadyside special. They also offer gyros, wings, salads, calzones, wedgies, hoagies, pastas, traditional, white and gourmet pizzas. \n\nPizza Perfectta is part of a chain of pizza shops that include Cafe Milano, Pizza Milano and Pizza Mineo's"
"2","I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  \n\nOne thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.\n\nThe pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:\nFiori's\nPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)\nPizza Perfectta\nAiello's (Murray Street)\nBeto's\n\nSave for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.\n\nPizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place."
"1","In all fairness, I went to this place after stuffing myself at Vincent's Pizza Park.  Still, I know a good pizza when I see one, and this place is totally passable, but great or even good it is not.  My friend and I were given our pizza in a box although we were planning on eating on the premises.  Still, it seemed like we were not wanted and decided not to press the point.  We walked across the street to a parking lot and saw a Pizza Perfecttta box and some leftover pizza littered on the ground.  In the end we didn't finish our pizza and assumed that many people in the past have been hastily handed their pizza, pushed out the door, only to walk across the street, eat mediocre pizza, and decide it wasn't even worth the energy to pick it up and throw it away."
"1","Ew. Okay, not the worst pizza ever, but it's pretty far down my list of pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across the street from it. This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \""Excitingly flavored!\"" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.\n\nOh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's \""perfetta,\"" not \""perfectta.\"""
"2","Well since I stop here on my way home from work every Friday I have to give it 5 stars.  Some of my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  The cheese blend is really good.  Firm, not too greasy, and the sauce is really well balanced.  But how about the crust?  Really nice texture.  Perfect chewiness.  I would recommend Perfectta to anyone!"
"1","DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste, then by all means these are the wings for you. If not, stay away. My boyfriend and i each ate one and couldn't even finish the rest of our dinner. Don't waste your money!"
"2","There aren't many places in Pittsburgh where you can get an above average large cheese pizza for $9. They also have a traditional pizza place menu with salads, hoagies, breadsticks, pastas, and munchies. The cheesesticks are great when you're craving something cheesy and salty, and their grilled chicken salad with fries and ranch dressing is dependable as well. \n\nOne great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work, so I'm always tempted to stop here.\n\nIf you're looking for a great place to grab an inexpensive pizza, check out Pizza Perfectta!"
"2","Friends, if you are going to Pittsburgh and don't stop by Pizza Perfectta, you are missing out on service and food combined that is must have. I have the privilege of knowing the owner and his family well, and I can thoroughly endorse his professionalism and product satisfaction. An exceptional pizza delivery spot you will be grateful to attend. Excellent variety, hearty taste, and pleasurable service. And they have the awards to back it up, winning last years Best Pizza in Pittsburgh Award for 2012 from a reputable area magazine. \n\nIn conclusion, GO!"
"1","Got the rancho and the Greek, not so bad but I probably won't go back... Too heavy for me..."
"2","I stopped by here today with my fianc\u00e9 for a quick slice of pizza for myself.  I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future.  I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future."
"1","I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. \n\nThe people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall, i wouldn't go back."
"2","Don't be fooled by the humble exterior:  their food is delicious!\n\nBetter than Pizza Sola.\n\nIts my favorite pie in Shadyside, and their hoagies and gyros are also delicious."
"1","They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said \""oh that's ok....\"" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?"
"1","I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again."
"2","These guys are great. We took our more mature, distinguished hound  for a check up and meds for worms and they were so kind and gentle. They truly love animals here and are willing to work with you if you have payment issues as well. They always seem to have an opening on the same day when I call, which is a huge plus! Dr Simard is really awesome and not afraid to be covered in slobber which is a way of life for any Basset owner. Dr Gerson is really great also- funny guy (kind of gruff, but kind if you look beyond that). An overall wonderful practice run by professionals!"
"1","The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \n\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\n\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :("
"2","OMG where to begin. I had a very sick kitty who had been to the ER twice. I was already $1,500 in the hole for vet bills in 2 weeks for an 11 month old kitten, I took her to AVETS and all they wanted to do was cut her open (I was not gonna go that route). She was very sick one night so I was frantically searching for a  2nd opinion. My husband and I showed up on their doorstep just as they opened and I was desperate to have her evaluated by a fresh pair of eyes. The first person we encountered was so sweet and I could tell she really wanted to help us and god bless her she got us right in (thank you) and I am sorry I never got your name. We saw Dr.Simard who is amazing, she was very kind and empathetic with regard to our situation. I was so stressed and so tired from not sleeping that I almost broke down in her clinic (I am in medicine and I am usually a rock), and her swift thinking outside the box that had both diagnostic and comfort in mind for my lil one. She ran some tests and started treatment and more importantly she made me feel like we are gonna figure out a DX and everything will be OK. My lil Lulu is feeling much better and I want to thank everyone at PBVC for making it happen, they gave us excellent healthcare with GREAT bed side manor & I would recommend this practice to anyone."
"2","I took my two cats to Dr. Mathias for annual physicals and minor maladies for nearly 10 years. (In fact, I got one of my cats from Barbara, who was the receptionist at the time.) She set the standard of what I expect from veterinary care, and the office was managed by true professionals. \n\nThe cats responded really well to Dr. Mathias' caring nature, and I appreciated it, too. She always spent enough time with us to answer my questions and provide advice on daily or post-operative care.\n\nWe didn't do as well with Dr. Gerson, but I know that others, particularly dog parents, really appreciate his expertise.\n\nWe were really disappointed to leave this place behind when we moved away from Pittsburgh. They are top-notch."
"2","This is a great little neighborhood market with a terrific friendly atmosphere. There's a large deli menu and very fresh tasty coffee, in addition to your standard one-of-everything-else lining the shelves. Its proximity to Frick Park makes it an excellent place to stop for sandwiches and provisions for a picnic. There are also a couple of tables and chairs lining the sidewalk outside in case you want to stick around. If you get really into the market, or the Point Breeze neighborhood, you can even buy a commemorative t-shirt to remember it all."
"2","Frick Park Market's extensive selection of Boar's Head meats and cheeses, Breadworks baked goods, and homemade soups makes it a solid choice for a simple, inexpensive lunch.  Prosciutto and capicola with lettuce, tomato, and banana peppers is a personal favorite."
"2","Used to live two blocks away and now I miss having it so close! Great sandwiches, and would always get my weekly bag of coffee and milk. The owners are friendly and helpful."
"2","On our way back from DC to Chicago yesterday, we stopped off here since my friend swore by it. One of the best co-ops I have ever been to. They have such a huge selection of products. If you are looking for vegan cheese, this place has a humongous selection including Sheese, which my bud says is really hard to find. They carry my beloved Temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. Nummers! I grabbed delicious produce, a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by Najat's Cuisine, a STILL WARM ginger cookie made there, a raspberry ginger beer, and I'm sure I am forgetting something. I would come here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their hot food looked good, but I wanted something to grab and go.\n\nFunny thing, in the time that we were there, three people commented that they really liked my tattoos. Then the cashier said he liked my Obama button. I love this place!"
"2","There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  \n\nI was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.  \n\nThey also have a juice bar & vegetarian \""cafe.\""  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!  \n\nThere must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town."
"2","Spices, spices, spices! Best deal in town when you run out of something and don't want to pay $7 for another bottle of parsley at Giant Eagle. I also appreciate the affordable selection of local milk products, eggs, bread (Allegro Hearth, yum!) , and honey. One gripe - salad mix, it's 4.99 a bag! You can get the same salad mix at TJ's for 1.99, 2.99 if you want organic. And currently most of the produce is shipped from other states/countries. I don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great."
"2","Just moved here from Baltimore and ran across this place.  Love it!  Watch yourself at the hot bar.  There's no scale (should be).  Your mea l(of veggies, tofu and kale) could end up costing $20 easily.  I usually grab a hot meal and play on my computer 1-2 hours.  Love the carrott juice with ginger YUM!  A small is $4.30 ouch!  Just found out they won't charge you for bags if you bring your own....COOL!"
"1","Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\"" you're seeing stuff.\""  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\""Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\""  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?"
"2","I'm so glad we have the Food Co-Op in Pittsburgh. Although still fairly expensive, it's less than Whole Foods, and I don't do all my shopping here, just the things I have a hard time finding elsewhere. The bulk selection is one of the best I've ever seen, and I truly appreciate the salad bar on busy days. Their choices are more on the crunchy/hippie side than the high-end gourmet side of things, and it's nice to shop for vegetables without having to turn something down because it's not organic...most of the produce is. The staff is helpful and friendly, and, if someone doesn't know an answer to a question, which can happen with a volunteer, he or she will find out for you. On member 10% discount days it can get very busy, so go early or late."
"2","My first trip to the east end food co op was sort of a disappointment,  I guess I heard so much about it that I sort of made it bigger (in my mind) than it was.\n\nFirst, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't.\n\nNice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things \""local\"" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers. \n\nGreat juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing.\n\nGreat spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas. \n\nGood vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. Good dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.\n\nThat said, the east end food co op is a good place to shop for the pantry."
"2","Love the East End Food Co op .  Reasonably priced organic selections.  The smoothie/juice bar is outstanding.  Great vegan/and or healthy selections at the hot and cold salad bar.  My most favorite thing here is the ability to purchase raw, unpasteurized unhomogenized milk.   \n\nThe staff is very friendly, the. produce is very fresh.  This is definitely a good way to avoid the over priced, over processed major grocery chain food selection.  I love the co op."
"2","The co-op is great!  When we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy, we were lost -- until we found the East End Food Co-op. That was 10 years ago and I've shopped there weekly ever since. It provides for all of our gluten-free, dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. I also love buying grains, beans, etc. from the bulk bins, fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals, nut butters, snacks, etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in Vegan options. Also, have to mention the awesome produce section, stocked mostly from local farms."
"1","just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction.  normally, i have had the best experiences there. . . all have been very cooperative and helpful.  but, i guess they are so successful that they are becoming arrogant.  here's the rub:  my hubby sent me a picture of a chandelier they had; i did not see the picture until 30 minutes later; by then he had left the store.  i called to BUY the chandelier over the phone.  this has been done before (we WERE construction junction junkies).  the lady adamantly refused to help me. she adamantly refuesed to even listen to a description of the fixture!  she gave the following excuses:\"" well, if you have been here in the last 12 years, you know how this place works\"";  \""I can't go back there and try to find out what you want\""; \""i am the only one on the floor\""; \""this is first come, first serve\""; \""if your husband comes in and it is still here, then we'll sell it to him\""  \""how will i know which one it is - we have so many back there...\"" .... i could hear the smirk in her voice as she enjoyed blowing me off. . .  i even offered to send her the picture my husband sent me via email - she refused.  keep in mind, i wanted to pay for the item.  my husband cannot go back to construction junction today. . . most likely the item will be gone. . . it would have been nice had this  sales agent been more helpful - especially when it was clear how badly i wanted to buy the fixture.  she did not express any concern whatsoever for my requests:  (like, so sorry, i can't help you at the moment, please call back and i'll try to accomodate; give me a brief description and i'll try to find it... etc.).  sometimes, even if you can't accomodate someone, it's how you say it that makes all the difference.  construction junction will implode if it begins to treat its customers indifferently."
"2","This is a great place to buy re-purposed old windows, office furniture, old industrial sinks, old wood, door knobs, electrical stuff and more for construction projects. Found a matching IKEA office cabinet with one I had for only $20. It was originally $450 and IKEA no longer made it so it was a great find!"
"2","i'm all for recycling / re-using/sustainability but a lot of the items in here are just ... junk / ugly crap that no one with any real aesthetic taste would want in their home.\nprobably better for sourcing fixtures for industrial / commercial spaces ..."
"2","I love this place. If you have a project that is on a budget or if you just want to go somewhere to get inspired to start a project than this is the place for you. They have everything here including the kitchen sink."
"2","If you've got that talent to create something out of the unexpected, then you HAVE to stop here.\n\nI was looking for something unusual to use in my apartment for storage.  I had stopped at several big box stores around the city before here and left each one of them in disappointment. \n\nI must admit, driving to this place I was a little skeptical.  I pulled in and honestly thought that Yelp directed me to a warehouse.  But I did not let that deter me from venturing out of my car and into the building.  Once you walk inside it is like walking into someone's garage that you just want to rummage through.  You know what I mean, you walk in and see all this dingy looking stuff that you see potential in.  You want to take it home with you.  sometimes you want to polish it up and make it look new, other times you want to let it be and let that distressed look shine through.\n\nI easily spent a hour in here just browsing the shelves.  I saw potential in a lot of the items I saw lining their shelves.  And I took a few items home with me.  When I reached the register I was truly floored by the price.  When I say that, it's because it was so low.  I was expecting to pay more, but I definitely came out of there with more money in my pocket than I needed to, but that is one sure fired way to make sure that a person returns to your establishment."
"2","I love this place.  I've come here for the odd bits and bobs--brass casters for a piece of antique furniture (25 cents each), vintage milk glass door knobs ($30), wardrobes for a closet-less room ($40 each), a set of four wooden chairs ($10 each), etc.  If you buy something larger, they will hold it for a small fee and then the crew will load it into your truck for you.   If you're into old houses, reserve at least 30 minutes to get through the whole store and you won't be disappointed."
"2","If I had to describe it in two words: DIY Heaven. Does an acronym count as one word? I'm going to say it does.\n\nWe had a place somewhat like this in my hometown, but it was not nearly as massive or as interesting as Construction Junction. So many antique door knobs and chandeliers, windows, cabinets, toilets, tubs! Things ripped off/out of old houses, spare vending machines, cafeteria benches, even a pulpit. And everything was so reasonable! I found at least a dozen things that I really wanted that were priced under $50. \n\nShopping here really makes me wish I owned a pick-up truck. If I did I would haul away windows, chairs, mantlepieces, desks, and file cabinets in mass quantities. Then wonder where all this crap is gonna go in our tiny apartment..."
"2","Construction Junction is an incredible experience! Just drive a block off Penn Ave in Point Breeze, pull into a fenced-in parking lot, and head toward a little door attached to a deserted-looking warehouse. The little door opens into an old, dusty space filled with used home items. Don't forget to check out the crazy pieces of artwork suspended from the ceiling as you walk through! \n\nThe warehouse has a range of items from treasures to no-one-would-ever-buy-this pieces. Today I saw:\n\n-fabulous 1960s desks\n-old scratched and/or locked filing cabinets\n-retail display cases\n-disassembled kitchen cabinets and countertops \n-ancient (and very intriguing) appliances \n-hundreds of toilets and bathroom sinks\n-random bathroom and kitchen tiles\n-carpet remnants\n-lots and lots of random chairs\n-light fixtures varying in quality from brilliant chandeliers to barely-operational\n\nThe list just goes on and on and on. Take the oddness of this list and multiply it by 3... then you're getting close to imagining what Construction Junction is like. \n\nMake sure to enter this store with zero expectations, no particular items to buy, and an empty home. Sadly, my home is filled (though I really wanted that 1960s desk...), and I had an item to buy (a filing cabinet). We left empty handed and drove straight to Office Depot, where I purchased a $90 (vs $25 here) filing cabinet that was not locked, had smooth-running drawers, and is not scratched up. Even though I didn't find what I needed today, I cannot wait to return here in the future."
"2","As a DIY'er - this place is a sanctuary. I've been here quite a few times during the weekends .. if not to buy .. just to browse around. This place is huge and you can pretty much find anything. If you can't find something you're looking for - you can simply ask one of the CJ personnel making rounds to make sure you've found what you're looking for.\n\nI was looking for a bi fold door few weeks ago and found exactly what I was looking for less than $15. - you can find doors as low as $5 and I'm not talking dirty stained or broken door. Besides used goods - there are few new \""recycled\"" items including plastic corrugated roof panels and paints for super low prices.\n\nAlso, if you're remodeling your house and need to throw those old materials - they have a number of recycle bin where you can simply drop it off."
"2","A great place all around whether you are looking to donate or buy something.   If you are looking for an old door, tile or quirky part for a home project this is the place to go.  I recently bought a new vanity and was able to donate the cabinet portion (do check the website for specific requirements on donations). They make it easy as you back your car up to the large warehouse doors and a helpful worker will unload. Don't forget your receipt for tax time!  I  live 4 blocks away and often go to drop off recycling another great benefit of this place.  They have large bins for many different recycling options from card board boxes to plastic. \n\nAlso  this place is nonprofit and they have an amazing fundraiser every year in September called the Big Pour.  $75 ticket gets you all the beer and food you could want for 3 hours.  Best event in Pittsburgh!"
"2","This complex is chock full of all things sportsy...gymnastics, fencing, biking, and yeah, rock climbing!!  It's nothing high tech and the first climb is $12 regardless of whether you're a student or a lady on ladies night (I was both).  This hike in price is so some guy can explain some basic rules to you for 3 minutes...what a deal.  Regardless, the rates are really reasonable (although I've never been to a rock gym before so I could be way off).  \n\nI climbed in the free fall area without ropes.  Climbing courses are marked by colored tape on the walls so you can climb according to your skill level.  It's a great work out...I can barely move my arms enough to type out this review."
"1","The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, and more expensive. Definitely not worth it. Worst customer service I've seen in a while."
"2","I love the Climbing Wall.  There are tons of routes which change fairly regularly in both the bouldering and top roping areas.  There's also a wide variety of difficulty levels in the gym ranging from ones everyone can do to those much more challenging.  Bouldering routes are labeled from VB and V0 (easiest) all the way up to the insanely difficult V7 and V8, while the top roping routes are labeled from Easy to Hard.\n \nPricing is reasonable, especially on Wednesdays, which is ladies night--$6 to climb (after your first visit).  Other days the price is $12 or $10 for students/military plus the cost of equipment rentals.  If you plan on going at least once a week (or more often like me) buying a membership is the way to go, and there are different specials each month.\n\nSometimes the gym can get crowded (especially on Wednesdays) but there's lots of routes and it's fun to take some time and meet other climbers."
"2","Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers. It does get pretty crowded sometimes, especially on Friday nights. I'd say they are almost in need of an expansion! Keep up the good work, Climbing Wall. I'll be seeing you a lot for the next year :)"
"2","As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating, but the staff at The Climbing Wall helped me get on the right path. Also, the regulars here seemed very nice and always willing to help out a newbie. It isn't very expensive either, 10 or 12 bucks for a full day of bouldering is a very reasonable deal (I haven't seen many places which were cheaper). \n\nI'm sure a lot of people, including myself, wish this place was a little bigger, but for being in the city it's not a bad size. It's actually surprising how many routes they managed to plan out for the size of the place, there's more than enough to keep the walls feeling fresh even after many climbs. The diversity of the routes is really great too, there's plenty of routes for each skill level and climbing style. \n\nThe overall experience was wonderful: great staff, great people, and a great setup. \n\nTip: If you're a beginner without your own equipment, the shoe rental is worth the extra 3 or 4 bucks."
"2","I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!) I wish they would expand their hours. Otherwise, they make a nice effort to change their routes relatively often."
"1","Sub-par setting quality, infrequent wall resetting, inconsistent grading, poor climate control, poor air quality (no chalk filter), silly rule where they make everyone wear paper wristbands before entry. + 1 star because they are finally installing air conditioning."
"2","I've been climbing here for 2 years. Membership is definitely worth it if you're planning on going frequently. I prefer to walk because parking is less than ideal and I live close by. The routes in the bouldering area are fun and challenging, and they're reset at a good frequency. New holds and new mats have been purchased in the past year, so a lot of the comments I'm seeing on here are outdated. \n\nThis is definitely a better gym for bouldering than top roping. The top roping area is pretty small, but they work with what they've got. I've always found the staff to be friendly and knowledgeable."
"1","Pros:\n- At least there's a climbing gym in this area\n- Walls get reset often\n\nCons:\n- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now, and I have felt like some of the walls really need some padding besides the not-so-great spring board they have. The walls are pretty high and the height + lack of mats retract me from climbing certain routes, which is really disappointing because it ruins my climbing experience. \n- I brought up the aforementioned lack of mats to the woman who works here, and she snapped at me: \""Mats are only supposed to be under walls that are sloped.\"" I told her the wall I was talking about was sloped, and she replied curtly \""If you don't feel comfortable climbing those walls without a mat, then you shouldn't even be climbing them.\"" I was in shock. Is this a way you should be addressing your climbers' legitimate concerns? Even if it isn't possible to have mats, she could have at least told me in a nicer way instead of talking to me as if I knew nothing. \n- The gym closes at 11PM on Fridays. I usually go at night until they close, but the staff passive aggressively starts turning off the gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's a Friday night and you want to get outta here. But the business hours are until 11PM, so let me enjoy my last ten minutes of climbing because I am paying for my climbing membership and I want to get as much climbing as I can get out of my sessions at the gym. \n- The holds are old and covered in rubber from the shoes. It would be nice if they could at least pressure wash them every once in a while. \n- The fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here."
"1","Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump.."
"1","The ventilation in the bouldering area is terrible. Please install some chalk eaters. People are inhaling tons of chalk into their lungs and are going to get pneumoconiosis from climbing at your gym."
"1","I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\n\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\n\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\n\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\n\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\n\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh."
"1","There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall, but overall I was quite disappointed.  I wanted to like this place, so I'll start with the positive aspects.  \n\nFirst of all, the gym in pretty cheap.  And the bouldering area is really quite good.  To be honest, this should only be a bouldering gym. There were a lot of different volumes, nice routes, some top outs, and a good cave area.  Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. \n\nIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent.  I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon.  The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. \n\n\nNow the downsides.  The staff wasn't very helpful.  The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test.  It's poor form. \n\nThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull.  They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground.  I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. \n\nThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible.  Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned.  Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous.  \n\nThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.  I believe there is some potential here, but it seems to be mismanaged and on the whole, a missed opportunity."
"1","Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote."
"1","Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!"
"1","This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it, but this place said they would not pass it.  Weird how it passed inspection 3 times already with no other place mentioning the door being a problem.  Never giving this place any business again, I went to a different Meineke in Homestead where they are helpful and work with you."
"2","OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\n\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology."
"2","My wife and I have been here a number of times and it's gotten better each time. Some tips:\n\n- stick with the appetizers. Every one we've had is fantastic. The entrees are fine, but nothing special. The apps, on the other hand, are truly first rate.\n- eat as much of their bread as your stomach will let you. Holy crap it's good!\n- It's BYO, so make sure to bring your favorite bottle of wine.\n- On a nice day, inside, but by the big window/door to the left. It let's in a nice breeze and makes the meal fantastic.\n\nTry this place, you won't regret it."
"1","Lamb burger was outright bad(tasted off and charred). We shared and together only ate half. The filet was decent but not $25 worth of decent. Waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. There are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion, this isn't one of them."
"1","I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people, I was totally disappointed with the service, food, and the place itself, I will not be headed back......ever\nSave your money, or starve either would be a better option"
"2","We stopped by for the first time on a cold Friday night around 9:30. We made sure to have reservations, as the place is pretty small. It's BYOB and we didn't bring our own wine because we weren't in a drinking mood, but once we sat down we realized this was the kind of place where you needed a bottle of wine. The decor is like an slightly charming mess of old furniture, clean table clothes, and scarves draped over the windows of the converted garage. We sat right by the door and right under the old dresser that the owners stand at. \n\nThe food was good. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque, which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing, but instead of coming in it's own sauce, they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course. After reading mixed reviews about this place, I was pleasantly surprised, \n\nThis place was a hot mess with slightly cold food, but I really liked it."
"2","The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. \n\nThe waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.\n\n\nI am so glad I went to Cafe Zinho finally and would happily come back here again."
"2","Shopping at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby.  I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us.  Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one.  We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho.  They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems.  The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over.  We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked).  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread.  It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly.  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup.  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees.  My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go.  She was quite pleased with it.  It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette.  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment.  My lamb burger was huge!  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney.  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger.  Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger!  I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium.  It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices.  My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy!  I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room.  My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up.  We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us.  It was a very nice meal and dining experience.  We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name.  Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often.\nPros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished).\nCons:  Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space."
"1","I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.\n\nMenu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy. \n\nI might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere."
"1","This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \""chicken maputo\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\"".  Does the average diner know what \""maputo\"" and \""piri piri\"" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\n\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman."
"2","Best Mussels!!! They were large and quite tasty.  The starter bread is corn bread and it is absolutely addicting.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on a whim on a weekday and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The setting is intimate and I enjoyed it.  I only wish we would've brought a bottle of wine since it's BYOB. The service was excellent as well. I have no complaints, even if it is CASH only I think it's worth it. \n\nNOTE: Cash only.  They do have an ATM inside for your convenience. BYOB"
"2","What an absolutely delightful and special dining experience!  Our family of four went there for dinner this past Friday night.  Brought along  two  bottles of wine, which is such a nice bonus. Much cheaper and we were able to bring wines that we enjoy.  The decor is lovely, very bohemian and cozy.  Just magical.  Our server was Bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  The food is Portuguese, which is primarily fish based, so we ordered accordingly. To start we ordered the cod fritters, the grilled octopus and a special salad of the night, farm grown tomatoes with Roquefort cheese.  All very delicious!  Main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous flavor), the impeccable seafood stew and the salmon, also lovely.  Just a perfect relaxing meal in every way.  If you live in Pittsburgh and have not been, this place is a gem. Worth checking out.  Wish we lived closer (we are DC based)."
"1","Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\n\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\n\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked."
"2","The grounds are very nice here, but I have to say the part I loved best was the collection of cars. I've never seen so many antique vehicles in one place. Definitely makes it worth checking out. However. The location is a bit wacky. It's right outside of Wilkinsburg, which isn't a place to visit at all. But still, it is nice enough to check out. Especially if you want to just go have a nice lunch at the cafe."
"2","I am a history fan...so when a friend told me about this I made sure he took me to go see it.  The property is very beautiful...\nWe waited a few minutes and signed in....surprising it was discount day!  The waiting area itself was exquisite and already gave rich history of the property and the people who had lived there. By the time we finished looking it over, our tour guide came in.  She was perfect...very knowledgeable and sweet.  She answered any questions we had and made us feel very welcome there.  She gave us ample time to roam around each room.  \n\nThe house is amazing and moreso the car collection.  That is free...and a must-see.  Also is you like art don't miss the art collection."
"2","I can't comment on the Art museum, but I did get to see the car and carriage collection as well as the estate. Although slightly hassled by over-enthusiastic docents, I had a great time (though short) viewing the car and carriage collection. There was a much larger variety than I anticipated.\n\nThe house was just incredible. Distinctly Pittsburgh on the outside, but easily one of the best examples of homes from that era on the interior. Our guide was interesting, knowledgeable, and happy to respond to questions. We had ample time to explore each room. In fact, maybe too much time. The tour ran on the long side as far as house tours go and I'll admit I got a little antsy by the end. It was also a little chaotic because there were at least two other groups in the house while we were there (I'm impressed if they get that kind of visitation regularly). Nevertheless, I had a great experience and would happily encourage any of the Art museum visitors to head over and take the tour. I might go back, if only because I didn't get a single picture of the place.\n\nOh, and, if nothing else - thumbs up for the ample free parking. As an out-of-towner, it made it one of the easiest parts of my trip."
"1","The art museum is pretty nice; the carriage and car museum is cool; and it's neat to walk through the greenhouse.  Those are free.  However, nothing really separates the $12 house tour from other house tours.  Like the other ones, the docents don't focus on anything interesting, like history or the architecture or the building itself.  They focus on some family story that may only be of passing interest because the family is rich.  Kind of like hearing about Paris Hilton or the Kardashians.  B-o-r-i-n-g. And what kind of tourist attraction doesn't allow pictures?"
"2","I popped in to the Frick because, well, why not?  I had the afternoon free and the weather was beautiful.\n\nSure, it's not MOMA, or the Met, or LACMA.  What were you expecting?  But what the main collection lacks in cachet, it makes up for with its outstanding curators.  I can't rave enough about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff are.  They went out of their way to describe the history and intricacies of each work of art.  It made even the most average of pieces come alive.\n\nThe car collection was amazing, and the staff in the outbuilding were equally helpful.  The gentleman that I spoke with went through the collection car by car, giving an enormous amount of detail and history for each vehicle.  It made what would have been an average visit fantastic.\n\nI didn't have a chance to do the tour of the mansion, but I did walk around the grounds, and they're perfect to while away some free time on a nice day."
"2","What a Frick-ing fantastic place!\n\nThe Frick Art & Historical Center has all the bases covered when it comes to museums: historical site, visual art, beautiful grounds, classic cars and buggies, restaurant, greenhouse.  Not to mention that everything -- with the exception of the house tour -- is free.  No one could possibly say there's *nothing* that here interests him here.  Husband certainly couldn't convince me.\n\nI kid.  He's a trooper.\n\nWe arrived at the Frick on a gorgeous blue morning and started out with an excellent tour of the Frick family abode.  When the family moved to New York City after Henry Clay struck it rich in the steel business, they kept their house in Pittsburgh for return visits to the city; 93% of what's in the house is original to the Frick family, which always makes a house tour more interesting to me.  They lived lavishly, and Frick was an avid art collector.  His personal collection -- displayed both in the home and museum -- is impressive.\n\nAfter our tour we visited the Car and Carriage Museum, which had husband transfixed with its Model T Touring Car, Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, American Bantam Convertible Coupe, Panhard et Levassor Tonneau and Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton among others.  Finally, we finished up with a spin around the Art Museum itself.  It's a beautiful building with a very manageable size.  I was thrilled to find a current exhibition of Medieval Persian pottery -- found along the ancient Silk Road route -- currently running as well.\n\nSay what you will about H. C. Frick (let's be real: the Johnstown Flood and handling of the Homestead Strike would have tarnished Mother Teresa's image), the Museum and Historical Site are *well* worth your time."
"1","These people could not care less.\n\n I am still waiting for my washer dryer to get fixed -its been almost a month now and I am being told that they don't even know when the technician will return. The technician has been here 4 times already. Each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part. Miraculously the part is wrong (first week), They forgot to order the second part (2nd week), Part comes in but they need a suppossed other part and it will be \""another 3-5 days\""(3rd week), Fourth week rolls by and they \""don't know\"" when its coming in (thats up to the distributor). When I ask for an ETA (because I am wearing dirty clothes, and I am sick of technicians coming back 5 times and I already took off a week of work to meet these people) the cus.t service rep gets mad at me and offers me a refund. (The washer is on warranty) They obviously don't want to deal with any problems they created. So now I have to call the distributor to see when the part is coming in (yup,  thats YOUR job Appliance Service Center!)."
"1","I am a jack of all trades and a do it yourself-er at heart. While in college I worked as a promotional photographer for my very dear friends salon. As a barter service she always did my hair for free! !0 years I had this deal going on. As you can imagine I was pretty spoiled and didn't want to start paying to get my hair did. I began coloring it myself. Now as a licensed skin care specialist you pick things up from the cosmetologists working with you.\n\nI killed it, fried it and melted it. My hair was in dire straights! I have dark hair but I love being a red head. Marcia Cross red to be exact. Whoops! Lightening that many levels should not ever be done by a novice. What can I say?  I'm stubborn that way, and think I can do it all! \n\nI reached out to Emilio for help! I have to say that after many hours of laying down color he managed to make my hair healthy again and I left feeling like a movie star. A red headed movie star! I was flipping my hair all the way to the parking garage and even did a photo-shoot later that evening. Yes I did a photo-shoot because I needed a professional head shot for my work portfolio.\n\n\nI don't know if I'm being too harsh but my hair did turn out much darker than I had wanted it to be. I know sometimes it is hard to predict the outcome when mixing chemistries. \n\nThe other problem I had was the price tag, or the surprise when I went to pay. $250.00 for a color correction! I know this is normal sometimes when fixing the damage but it is also crucial to give your client some kind of idea on payment. I had gone in for color estimated at around $70. I think they did a decent job but for that money It should have been closer to what I asked for. Needless to say I haven't been back but would recommend in a jam."
"1","Sadly, the professionalism of the front desk never got better.  Despite Emilio's assurances that changes were being made, my latest visit proved otherwise.  I called ahead and was assured that Marshall was on time...in fact, he didn't have an appointment ahead of mine and could take me as soon as I got there.  I was there a few minutes before my appointment.  I waited.  And waited.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked if Marshall knew I was waiting.  I was told by the brunette that they had been busy.  Odd, she, the blonde and two other employees had been standing there talking for a while.  She went back to notify Marshall.  When Marshall came up front to get me, the brunette admonished him that he should keep an eye out for his clients - she shouldn't have to notify him that his appointment is there.  Wow.  And the purpose of a receptionist is....what?  I'm done.  I'm out.  Apparently nothing will help Izzazu's but getting rid of the front desk staff.  \n\nOn a positive note, it was another great cut.  Not good enough to lure me back, though."
"1","I recently had semi-permanent lashes put on for my wedding at the WEXFORD Izzazu salon. Upon completion, I thought they looked a bit odd, but figured I just wasn't used to them yet. The next day was my wedding day, and my bridesmaids and I got our hair and makeup done at the downtown Izzazu salon. The makeup artist (who was great) said they looked terrible (which they did- they were uneven and there was white glue all over them) and had to remove them and reapply. They are supposed to last 2 weeks, so removing them the next morning was very unpleasant and I ended up losing a ton of my real lashes when everything was said and done. This added 1 hour+ onto my appointment and I ended up barely having any time for pictures before my wedding. I would steer clear of Izzazu for semi permanent lashes!"
"1","Awful facial with lulu. Used a groupon and thought it may be why she was so terribly unattentive, but realized she had no idea what I was paying with. Basically I got the 'steam machine' blowing on my face for 40 min!  \nWould give negative stars if I could."
"1","I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back."
"1","Emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself. I was put on hold twice and never picked back up. Emails went unanswered.  :(\n\nI was going to have SO MUCH done, too!! Hair cut, color with highlights, spa manicure/pedicure and an hour massage! All as a graduation present to myself but if they can't be attentive to prospective customers then I can't imagine that they'd be attentive in the store. I'll spend my money elsewhere!"
"1","A"
"1","Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away, 20 minutes later the second person was taken.  I WAITED 50 MINUTES while being ignored by the receptionists.  I can celled because the others were almost done and we would be running late. My stylist finally came out and said he'd quickly do my hair. What !! I'm not paying $100 to get rushed service. We were looking forward to a relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes to pay for the two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions and another was occupied with a wedding party.  I was so close to walking out and not paying. Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont. I am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience."
"1","I have lived in the area of Page's Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs. I have always enjoyed the ice cream until\"" this\"" day. I ordered an artic swirl (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough) I have ordered this same item over and over again. When I took first taste, no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, second taste, same thing, third taste, same thing and so on for approximately 5 or 6 tastes. I took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake, I was denied told it would waste \""their\"" money, nothing about mine, what I had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream. They dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me. Well it wasn't even a medium desert, since it fit into a small cup. I even tipped the girl $2 when I first received my desert. I will never return, to make any other purchases. I will however return to express my disdain to the owner when I can find him there. I hope he reads this."
"2","Considering my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.\n\nAs you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right?\n\nThe people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That \""line\"" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.\n\nA night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff! \n\nHeck, it's snowing today, and I'm probably going to go!"
"2","This place is a great Ice Cream Shop. My Favorite is the birch beer float. Delicious and under $2. A blueberry shake was made with real blueberries. Really, I haven't had a bad item here. Just make sure you bring cash, that's all they take."
"2","I'd rate this joint 10 million stars if I could. Best ice cream in PGH!!! They serve sundaes, milkshakes, and the old school cherry dip cones. Cool historic photos adorn the building in the back, showing how the intersection/ area looked about 100 years ago. I love Page Dairy Mart so much I want to marry it."
"2","Page's has was a staple of my childhood and young adult life.  There ice cream is great and their prices are good--evident by the line that is always out to Carson St.   I wish they had a tent with seating.  It rains. . .ALOT in Pittsburgh.  Eating in your car is the signature of this place but I wish there was some covered seating."
"2","The best ice cream in Pittsburgh! I've had so many different sundaes over the years. I recommend asking for vanilla with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce with graham crackers for a S'mores sundae. It is not posted in their window anymore but they will do it! \nWith the traffic from Liberty Tunnel closures rerouting past here, you should TOTALLY make a stop. It'll be the best part of your commute."
"2","Whoever doesn't give Page a 5 has no soul. It's childhood everyday March-October. I love the pretzel cones, but everything is good."
"2","Mmmmm. Their Egg drop soup is sooo good as is the General Tso's, and they deliver FAST!"
"1","Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:("
"2","I gotta give my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  The upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  Steve and Clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  This is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious he cares and appreciates the business so much.  The food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had.  The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  I  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now.  I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.  There's definitely a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce."
"1","Maybe I went on a bad night, but the service was stunningly bad.  Water glasses stayed empty for almost 15 minutes!  Ordered 5 dishes, all pretty average.  The tab:  $300+.  I won't be back."
"2","The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'."
"2","This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio."
"2","I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant."
"1","The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out."
"2","Gotta say....worth the effort to find this gem of a restaurant off the beaten path. First, the waitstaff at this place are incredible. They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh bread, a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better love garlic!\n\nAppetizer....a tasty softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely spiced red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly seasoned, juicy and delicious.\n\nSalad....wow! Crisp greens, olives, peppers, Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.\n\nPasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously spicy oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.\n\nEntrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful double chop, \""paddled\"" into tenderness, dredged in house made bread crumbs, tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare, tender, well seasoned...rich, decadent and incredible.\n\nDessert....yes...we forced ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light, balanced and very flavorful.\n\nHaven't really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome dining experience."
"2","After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \""Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\""  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again."
"2","Incredible experience up here, I would have to say that this goes down as one of my most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh for a number of reasons. I personally love this style of Italian cooking. Sicilian, so folks who are not familiar should take look at their menu online before coming because it might catch you off guard, it isn't what the \""normal\"" Italian restaurant offers. \n\nI had a great experience dodging potholes on my way through the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh which it makes it much more awarding arriving with my wheels of my vehicle still in alignment. They have valet parking which is great because it takes the stress out of trying to find parking.\n\nUpon entering I almost fainted at the smells and views of this place. Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \""Holy Oil\"" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \n\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\n\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\n\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\n\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!"
"1","No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there."
"2","Fabulous!"
"2","TOTALLY  one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!!  Food and service was just amazing.  The quality of the dishes was better than we had even in New York City.\n\nThis is definitely a restaurant to bookmark and remember for the ages.  Reminds me of the old style Italian restaurants that used to be in Bloomfield when that area was just a horrid place to go.  Well, Alla Famiglia is in the Allentown area which is not a neighborhood of choice.  Yes, your car is guarded in a private secure lot!!\n\nGet over the location, this is the gem of gems!  Old style design in a charming old building with copper and huge fans.  The kitchen is right there for you to watch and its worth watching this chef do his thing!  The dishes come out hot, no waiting, the service staff is like a tag team and they all share duties to get the food to you once its ready.\n\nThe quality of the food was impeccable and the 5 course presentation was really enjoyable...  Oh and dessert was to die for; Belgium chocolate gelato in a fresh waffle cone and the creamiest NY cheesecake you ever had with a hint of orange zest..."
"2","After hearing about AF and reading the reviews, I was expecting an amazing experience. We made reservations weeks in advance and I counted down the days. Finally, D day arrived. We arrived and quickly valeted the car. I would definitely suggest you valet. The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. \n\nWe were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down. For the price, I have had better meals and better service at other restaurants around the city."
"1","Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That, paired with a mediocre menu and overall experience, gives this two stars. Save your money and stay in town. I would probably send you to the (gasp) Olive Garden before I referred you here."
"1","My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last night. We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, \""UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab.\"" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.\n\nI don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.\n\nWhen I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant. Despite how great the food was, I won't be returning. SO disappointed."
"2","Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!"
"2","Very good Italian. The portions are very large, so do not be tempted by the bread early. My fianc\u00e9 and I shared two appetizers and an entree. The entree also gives a huge bowl of salad and penne alla vodka. This was so much food, we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. I would absolutely recommend this place, but would suggest pacing yourself."
"1","Well, the delivery was fast at least. Everything else was yucky. Avoid!"
"2","Best rates and deals. I now live in Arizona and still bank with dollar bank because I've been so satisfied with the offers and customer service!  Free ATM service nation wide, 1% interest on free money savings account and they give me .10 when I use my debit card.  What more could I ask for?"
"1","I was thrilled to finally find a yelp review with 4 stars and only one dollar sign on Yelp in the South Hills. Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails. But sadly, I don't see you at all in my future. 1.5 Stars"
"1","If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again."
"1","Had chicken salad. Was good but very pricey. Their pizza is about 20-30% more expensive than any comparable pizza in the area. And since the pizza is just mediocre it is definitely not a good value so I'll pass!"
"1","Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce was meh. Cheese was okay. Sausage was disgusting. Bishops used to use a delicious hot sausage. I don't know what this sausage was other then disgusting. I don't recommend getting a pizza from Bishops"
"1","The customer service is absolutely horrible. They made me wait an hour before anybody got to me, and there were 3 available beauticians in the back. I complained and got waited on right away. I thought the customer always came first. Why would they want to risk a customer not coming back. I mean I can just go down the road to Borics. These women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs. I won't be back. DISAPPOINTED...:("
"2","Great service, excellent place to get breakfast at any time of the day"
"1","My first trip here was on a Sunday at 4pm. I was surprised to see I was the only customer. We were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu. I wanted a verity so I picked the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, toast, sausage or bacon.\nI ordered my eggs scrambled and sausage links. I also ordered home fries and a glass of white milk. I could smell my food cooking as I waited anxiously ( I was starving)\nMy food was ready in about 8 minutes and looked tasty.\n\nAll in all good bargain and equal food quality I'll give them 2 stars.\nLike a Pirmantis it would probably be better if I had been drinking."
"2","I haven't been here in awhile, but I definitely miss it. They do hold slightly odd hours as it is a mom and pop joint and they are definitely more of a breakfast place than anything else. Their omelettes are to die for. I'm also a huge fan of their potatoes for breakfast and especially with their gravy. Yum!\nMy boyfriend is more of a burger person but he loves their burgers and fries. They have a few breakfast specials that are just as awesome\nIt is very small. And they do not take reservations to my knowledge. If you go on a Sunday morning you will def be waiting for a table.\nThey never used to accept cards but to my knowledge they recently have begun taking credit cards which is a big plus. This is definitely a mom and pop place you need to try."
"1","I'm in the market for a fun little scooter to have fun and commute on, and at the suggestion of a friend, I went to Bohn Cycle Shop to check out what they had in the shop. Immediately upon walking in, it took 15 minutes for someone to ask if we were helped. When I mentioned that I wanted to learn more about a Zuma over in the corner, the dude at the desk was disinterested and unhelpful.\n\nWhen I tried to pay for the scooter and roll it out, an older woman stewed around and gave me annoyed looks for coming into the store and not calling ahead. When I tried to pay with a bank-issued check, I had to wait around for nearly 20 minutes before they told me that they have never seen a bank-issued check and sent me on my way.\n\nThe entire time I was there, it felt like they thought I just stole a bunch of money and were treating me like a crook. I am definitely not going back to complete the transaction. If I'm going to be buying an expensive piece of machinery, I really expect the service to at least be a little more enthusiastic.\n\nLike Nick T. said, I guess it's a good place if you wanna grab a used bike or know exactly what you want. If you're looking to broker a new bike, go to a bigger shop with salesmen that actually sound like they're living beings."
"2","DiCarlos is in my opinion THE BEST pizza in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I will only order DiCarlos if we are in a pizza mood. It's different from your traditional pizza that they only cook the crust with the sauce, all the other toppings are added after it comes out of the oven. The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?)\n\nThis is take out only. No eating there guys. Also, there's not really a \""small\"" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint!\n\nI believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always go for the pizza."
"1","Maybe I just had a bad day.  This was THE WORST \""pizza\"" I've ever had.  I have had Original DiCarlo's in Wheeling, WV in several locations.  This is not even worthy of the name.  I got 3 extra cheese.  First off, the pizza was basically glued to the wax paper.  The crust was unevenly cooked.  First bite the crust was almost raw, dense, and way too chewy.  The sauce tasted sour and the cheese (shredded, not dices provolone like the Original) was slimy.  My second bite, the crust was burned, tasted burned, but at least it was crunchy.  There was no third bite.  The remaining slices got tossed in the garbage.  This was by far the worst \""pizza\"" I've ever had."
"1","I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside, not the drive thru. It seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant. I already sparingly frequent fast food establishments but this will definitely be the last attempt. And yes I have contacted the corp. I dont want anything from them though, they can keep it."
"1","The service here can be hit-or-miss, but more often than not, I don't have problems. Usually, when my friend and I stop by, we're waited on by the same server, and our food comes up relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, when they get busy, it creates problems because they don't have a stock of anything prepared, which in turn creates delays. Their cashiers have a habit of walking away from the counter in the evening, leaving customers waiting for however long it takes them to notice someone is standing there. While I understand that they have to clean up the restaurant for closing, there should always be someone to watch the counter.\n\nAs a side note, their drive-thru speaker went down about a month ago and still hasn't been repaired. It creates delays at the drive-thru window for placing orders, especially later in the evening due to above mentioned cashier habits."
"1","Someone please change the cooking oil!! With the construction on Rt. 51, it has been a very long time since I decided to put up with the craziness that makes up this intersection. A nagging for fried fish however, sent my daughter, and me to this LJS. Mistake number 1 was ignoring the deserted parking lot. Mistake number 2, was placing an order at the drive thru, and eating our 2 piece fish and more dinners, after the smell of old cooking oil put a damper on our nagging for fried fish.\n\nThe service at the drive thru was friendly, the girl at the window friendly, but the smell of old cooking oil, not so much. Not a soul in sight at this LJS. Yes, there are other places to get great fried fish, and after our experience, perhaps it's time to let this LJS walk the plank off our list. The fish was edible, not the usual crunchy, crumbly LJS fish. The hush puppies were soggy from either drowning in old oil too long, or sitting under heat lamps too long. The fries, endured the same sad torture as the others. Cheap, yes, but not worth the money, or Rt. 51 traffic anymore."
"2","Ahh the Park House.\n\nOh so you say you are looking for a bar? Wait what's that, you would like to have a live blue grass night?..Okay Okay...hold up..you want an historic building to house it all? Well then my friends I have a place for you. \n\nGrab your shoes and wallet and make your way there. Hungry? Get a Park House burger or even a Mexican War Street burger..hell try out the hummus..it's all great. Don't let the humble sized kitchen fool you..it cranks out some great meals. \n\nGreat for those who prefer a manly dart board aka a non electric one. Terrific for those who prefer imported beer from all over. If you like free peanuts and popcorn..don't pass this place up. \n\nThe very environment the bar unintentionally spews from the walls themselves will leave you wanting to come back. Think of the show Cheers, the edginess of Ireland and the heart of folk all bended together (for 2-4 mins depending on the blender) and you my friends have the Park House."
"2","After doing some drinking at some other places, we landed at Park House. Load me up with some more drinks and the free popcorn and peanuts (which you can just toss the scraps on the floor). I'm sold!! The beers were reasonably priced and this was the type of place where you can gather with friends and just hang out. No pressure at all. The lighting wasn't too dark so it felt intimate where you were sitting. Seems like a neighborhood bar where everyone knew each other. If I find myself in the area again I would head to Park House though there was the occasional creeper but I guess you can find them anywhere."
"2","Went my first time for Thursday karaoke and had a blast!  They serve mediterranean fare; at least half the menu is vegetarian/easily vegan.  There are at least 2 bike racks outside, cars have decent options too.  At 10pm an improv comedy group showed... you can imagine the energy.  Super fun night, met some cool people, ate healthy food.  Oh yes, and it's no smoking!     \n\nDownside?  It's a little pricey, but the quality is there, so... you decide."
"2","I have driven by this place a bunch of times and just recently realized that A:  it exists, and B: it's a bar.  I was encouraged to come here by the insistence of a friend who comes in enough that it's just a matter of time before he has his own personalized mug.  \n\nThey have a surprisingly excellent beer selection, mostly micros.  The drafts aren't cheap, at $5-$8 a draft but Happy Hour is from 6-8pm and is $2 off a draft. \n\nWe also tried the food.  While nothing to write home about, it's not bad by any means.  Decent falafel, hummus, lamb gyro...very Middle Eastern-centric.  I'm pretty sure I also ate my weight in peanuts and popcorn.\n\nI don't necessarily know that Park House will enter in my regular rotation, but I will absolutely join my friend in support of his quest for the mug."
"2","I first heard of The Park House, due to their Blue Grass night (Wednesdays). My boyfriend is a big blue grass fan, so we rallied some friends and headed over.  Parking is street, but we didn't have any problems finding a spot.  \nI love the look of this place. It's so Pittsburgh. (In a fun architecture way, not a dive bar way)  There was a good crowd for the music, but we were still able to get a table with a big group.  \nAs other Yelpers have pointed out, there's free popcorn and peanuts you can help yourself to.  They have a small menu, but the food is good.  We split an order of the hummus. YUM!  A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy.  The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries.\nThey do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood.  \nWe had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set.  That scores major points in my book.  I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well.\n\nAll in all The Park House is a decent spot to hangout! I will definitely be back!!"
"1","I had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a Groupon. This review is strictly for the food. It was not good. The hummus was okay, and our main plate seemed to be microwaved. \n\nThe bar ambiance seemed cool though. So if you are looking for a bar atmosphere, I'd probably rate this 3.5 stars. For dinner, not that great."
"2","I went here for Bluegrass night following Banjo Night at the nearby Elks Club. What a fun night!!! It is a very fun, friendly, music-loving environment. I believe this happens every Wednesday, so definitely check it out! I will be back for sure!"
"2","Only groups for trivia night. Unless you're okay with meeting random people at the bar, then by all means stay. Just make sure you're watching the game primarily then pipe in when you know the answer and people next to you have absolutely no idea what the answer is.  Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and know the final bonus round question worth a lot more...\nAlso go on live music night...it's free, the music isn't the greatest, but when it's free it's at the very least a good laugh when you've got friends to chill with, watch the game - Pirates for me is always the go to. Oh and did I mention that draft Yuengling is only $2! Doesn't get much better than that on the Northside ladies and gents!\nHope you enjoy the hole in the wall as much as I did!"
"1","Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed with Bernie's.  It's a shame it's the only real photography store in the city, but they could definitley do better.\n\nAs part of a black and white photography class, I needed to pick up film and photo paper, among a few other things.  While Bernie's had everything I needed (and lots of other supplies) I didn't feel all that appreciated for coming in.  I spent a couple hundred bucks and felt like I was being shuffled out the door as quickly as possible.\n\nI will give the one guy at the counter some credit because a woman right before me asked to get a roll or two of film developed in just barely an hour.  I could tell he wanted to get to it quickly, but still felt like I was hassling the guy just being there.\n\nI hate to see real camera stores shut down, but unless I'm in a pinch I'm probably going to order supplies online from now on."
"1","Up-charges most of their products that you can find on B&H for way less money. Sales person treated me like I was a very inexperienced. Not a bad place if you're in need of camera gear without a moments notice, but overall definitely order offline."
"1","I developed my 120 film here the other day, and they charged me an extra 4 dollars a roll for no reason.  On the website they say $8 but they charged me $12.  The owner is very pretentious and rude.  When I told him that it says 8 dollars online he didn't care at all.  When I dropped my film off the high school kid didn't even tell me the price because \""it is too much for me to calculate\""  Also, the photo equipment, darkroom equipment and film are way over priced.  I am never going back to this place.  I strongly urge everyone to never enter or deal with Bernie's Photo.  Rather, use the websites of companies like B&H, Adorama, or Calumet.  The have MUCH better customer service and better prices.  Very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city."
"1","Went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot. He charged me $20 for the same exact item that sells for $6.29 at B&H. I bought it without thinking, as I was stressing on the way to a gig, but was furious when I thought about it in the car.\nUnfortunately, this is the only game in town. Makes me glad I live in New York City. You would think a store in a dying industry would thrive to provide better customer service, pretty much the only reason why I would go to a small store rather than a big one. They don't even offer that."
"1","Just stopped in to see about selling my Canon Rebel T3 to buy a 60D (that they don't have in stock because it's \""old\""). I was offered $50 for my T3, that is currently being sold online for over $300. I asked why such a low price and was told that since it was an older model it wasn't worth as much. Needless to say, I walked out with my T3. Sucks that this is the ONLY camera shop in Pittsburgh."
"2","How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\n\nRandy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \n\nThe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \n\nThe food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. \n\nA really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly)."
"2","Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too."
"2","I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's."
"2","Great atmosphere, wonderful service and really great food. My husband and I shared the Brat sandwich and the sampler with schnitzel Lichtenstein, sauerbraten and something with an 'l' that I can't remember the spelling of (ground loaf)....all were excellent. We had the sauerkraut and spatzle, and cabbage as sides. The bread brought out before the meal included apple butter and sweet & sour relish (cabbage) and those were excellent too. Would love the sweet & sour relish in a side size portion it is so delicious. The red dining room is nicely decorated and love the cuckoo clock that is reminiscent of my grandmother's. The beer out of the mason jar is a fun touch.  Our bill came to $29 (1 beer, 1 diet coke for our drinks) and it was a fabulous meal for so little."
"1","I must of been eating at another Max's in a pararell universe!\n\nFood was terriable, service was worse! Went and got Sushi!"
"2","Have been  eating at Max's for 20 years.  One of the restaurants I misss the most now that I'm out of the 'Burgh.  Visit often and always stop by.  Great food and great Beer....not a bad combo.  I have dreams at night about there wurst platter and spatzele with cheese....definately a don't miss attraction"
"1","Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas, asparagus, and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. Good beer. Yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now..."
"1","Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub, good German beer selection, but food was less than mediocre.  Won't be back. Weisswurst was very bland.  Sauerbraten was dry and tasteless.  Spaetzle was, well, not tradidional German Spaetzle.  Schnitzel and purple cabbage  were the high points, but then again, it's hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet."
"2","Let me start off by saying that I am unfamiliar with German food. I cannot compare what I had with what is served in Germany, but I will describe my experience. \n\nI ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover. \n\nMy dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!! \n\nI NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!"
"1","Let me preface this by saying that my understanding of goulash came from what my mom called goulash.  Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \""world famous\"" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?"
"2","Nice lil bar/restaurant with awesome staff.\nMy favorite thing about this place: The staff.\nFriendly, kind and super nice."
"2","I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats, but if you're ever there when the soup special is beer cheese - ORDER IT!!.  I love their potato pancakes, sauerbraten and the basket of German rolls served with sauerkraut salad and apple butter.  The waitresses have been there for years, they are the best!  Most delicious long island iced tea in the city."
"2","I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.\n\nIts a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome."
"2","been here a number of times and it's my favorite German food in Pgh!"
"1","Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I,m not an employee or another restaurant making trouble for a competitor, just an average consumer that lives on the Northside .\n         When will I ever learn. I really want to like this place. It's a cool building with neat old fashion feel to it. But the food is mediocre at best.The last time I was there I got what they called German goulash. I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages. The only thing I can say is really good is the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. It is a bit over priced for the size, but it is always really good.\n\nSunday brunch\nA neighbor talked me into going here for the brunch and I was glad she did. For an all you can eat brunch they do a nice job keeping things stocked and fresh. The omelet chef was very good making stuff just as you asked him for, yum. The sausage is great and the bacon is cooked in a range of doneness that everyone can find. So, for dinner and lunch my original 2 stars stand but the Sunday brunch is a solid 4 1/2 stars."
"1","My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!"
"2","I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it, I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.\n\nThe menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.  \n\nThey have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back!"
"1","I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunch,except the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet. Cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer.  The chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best. The bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half raw.\nSo much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm. Since they have it in chaffing dishes, I've found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen. Makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is."
"2","Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try."
"2","I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I also don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet."
"2","Overall great German food!  I love the liver and onions above all else.  The kase spatzle is delicious, and you can't eat at Max's without an order of soft pretzels!  !"
"1","This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better."
"1","Max's was good, but I've had better.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a bad area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world tired feeling.\n\nThe menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.\n\nMy wife's Jaeger Schnitzel was good, but I've had better at Das Wald Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/das-waldcafe-newport-news)."
"2","Man, I just love this place.  Pennsylvanian German for sure. Some peeps don't know the Difference. If you want real Pennsylvanian German food, then this is your place. This is the kind of food that my grandmother cooked up in Erie, and my uncle sells at the butcher shop in Girard.  Go in the off hours; cause the bar is packed at lunch and late. Also go ahead and put a coin in the machine! You'll see. It pisses the bar crowd off temporarily but so worth it!"
"2","My first real German food experience and I can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious. I had the Max's Sausage Platter. Loved it all. Left nothing in my plate. I was with a big group of people and no one took a doggie bag home. Big menu. The restaurant has this small down home feel to it. The bar is really pretty. Great place."
"2","Best German food I've ever had. Hubby and I stopped here thinking we'd just have a few beers and grab a bite to eat, but we were surprised to say the least. \n\nEverything is made in house, which is enough to win me over. We started with the sausage and cheese plate, paired with the bread basket. Homemade honey mustard, gouda, Swiss, and the best kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure to bite into. Just as we're polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs, our entrees came. \n\nThe schnitzel was to die for, as was the rabbit, both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy. The sauerkraut was a perfect combination of savory and acidic. The potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour cream were just... Wow. \n\nI would definitely recommend getting the beer sampler, awesome deal and a great way to try all of their German beers without going overboard. We'll be back, for sure."
"1","I cannot believe Max's is going from 5 stars to 2 stars for me.\n\nYou have to understand, I love this place.  Over the years we have had so many family dinners here including my sisters rehearsal dinner, that it's almost become like eating at a relatives house.\n\nBut now that relative has gone senile and needs to go to a nursing home, and they can't cook anymore.\n\nFor the past two years, every time we come here we say, \""This just isn't as good as I remember.\""  For starters, the food is always served cold.  Don't believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.\n\nBTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.\n\nIn fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????\n\nI'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.\n\nPS--thanks for the nausea and hurling about 6 hours after dinner."
"2","This is my favorite place to go when I'm in the steel city.  The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is very friendly.  The beer sampler and Ruben is a solid choice but they also have a wide range of other options including hasenfefer and Wiener schnitzel."
"2","This place has the best beef lo mien I have tasted in Pittsburgh.  They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp.  My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well.  I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.\n\nI can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.\n\nThe obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try.  They're cheap and they give you tons of food.  It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long.  You can call in and order as well.  Not everything on the menu is the best but they have a huge menu to choose from."
"2","I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. If China Taste delivered I could easily see myself eating from here weekly.  This is a hole in the wall in a seedy neighborhood but I just can't get enough.\n\nThe Chinese food is some of the best I've had.  Typically get the Hunan Shrimp or Schezwan shrimp with a side of pork fried rice. The shrimp are big and taste fresh not frozen . large and cooked perfectly and the veggies are always crisp and not soggy and over done. Also we've had the sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken.  \nAlthough the restaurant is tiny and a little run down the food is very good.\nAll the entrees I've ever had were served pipping hot. \n\nThe restaurant is really nothing pretty and there are a total of 3 tables. The restaurant is tiny.  If you're passing through the Northside check this place out."
"2","If you're looking for good Chinese food at relatively inexpensive prices then China Taste is it. Large portions, fantastic steamed (and fried) dumplings, great combo selections all around a solid take-out place. Only downside is they DO NOT deliver. Other than that it is well worth it whenever you have the hankering for some Asian cuisine and a Netflix type of night."
"2","The best sandwiches at amazingly great prices!  The man who owns this is super nice and so helpful!  One sandwich feeds 2 adults and will fill both of you up.  The closest thing to a New York Deli in this area.  Go in here once and you will be hooked."
"2","We love the Priory!\n\nI don't remember how we found this place, but I feel so lucky we did.  A beautiful restoration of a lovely old building, the Priory is a comfortable, tasteful, beautiful hotel in a convenient part of the city.  We found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating, plenty of help and advice for weary holiday travelers, always delivered with a smile.  We will return to the Priory."
"1","I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.\n\nWe found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.\n\nI slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.\n\nEven without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.\n\nFor the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.\n\nPriory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role."
"2","Such a cute hotel!  I like to find non-chain hotels, but sometimes that can be scary...  The Priory was great!  Lots of character, not at all scary, very clean, modern, comfy - all the things you want in a hotel.  Well - the beds COULD be more comfortable.  It amazes me that hotel reviews rarely mention the bed.  To me, that is the most important part.  \n\nThe bed:  Too hard, for one thing.  The linens were great, very soft, and the comforter was perfect - light but warm.  However, the headboard was only loosely connected to the bed and - well, let's just say noisy.\n\nWe only stayed one night, so can't expand too much.  Breakfast didn't look too appetizing, so we went elsewhere.  The stairs are very squeaky but you can't hear them inside the rooms.  The elevator is great.  The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening.  \n\nI had made some specific request - away from the elevator, not facing the street, etc. - they fulfilled all of them.  I love it when a hotel pays attention!\n\nWe would absolutely recommend The Priory!"
"1","We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \""historical\"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \""historical\"" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \""renovated\"" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \""new\"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.\n\nBreakfast was \""eh\"".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.  Honestly, I felt like I was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here..."
"2","I liked this hotel, but it is something of a mixed bag. Would I stay there again? Yes, but be sure you have a car and are okay with gritty cities.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful rooms. We stayed in the historical side and had a very nice if not very large room (queen). Some reviewers said they had a mini-frig. Note that not all rooms have those.\nBreakfast was nice during the week. \nHotel was clean.\nAwesome, fantastic courtyard. You can eat breakfast out there if the weather is nice. \n\nCons:\nLocation. This is not a nice neighborhood. But you can walk to the Strip district, the Warhol Museum, and the stadium. \nEach room is different. It's a bit like playing the lottery.\nVERY small shower.\nBreakfast was less on Sunday, as they rely on local bakeries. It's a true continental.\nYou get yelled at for bringing your own alcohol onto the property. Yeah, we thought that was weird, too. No mention of it on the website, but they don't want you to bring your own drinks into the courtyard."
"2","Located in a kinda run down neighborhood, but worth it to stay in such a unique cool place. Everyone that works here is very friendly. Right after checking in and going up to our room, I noticed it smelled like stale smoke (even though this is a non-smoking hotel). They immediately switched our room, in fact they upgraded us to a much larger king room. Not bad at all for a free breakfast with a small but nice selection of meats, cheeses, and fresh fruit. The kind gentleman who works in the kitchen/tends to the breakfast buffet even went in the back and found us some water crackers for the Brie, upon request."
"2","The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that the area is slighty sketchy. Theres a small grocery store on the corner, & i hated walking by it bc people would hang out outside. They do have a free shuttle! They have excellent customer service besides Matt or something. He was grumpy. Our driver Hank or something was amazing! Soo sweet. We even sent my chocolates from Hawaii to thank him. The room was good size. Bed frame was metal so it was outdated a little. Our tub wouldn't drain like it was a bit clogged. Free breakfast buffet. I loved the Steeler fans we met there. It was our first time in Pittsburgh and we had a blast!"
"2","Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!"
"1","Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills.  Nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the \""people\"" at the priory are cold, miserable and just plain miserable. I get better guest service at Holiday Inn"
"1","I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6.  This room was relatively not cheap, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a last resort.  The next time I am in Pittsburgh it will not include a stay at The Priory, which is a shame because besides this issue it is a nice place. But if you are considering staying at this hotel why take the chance. While the party continues and I am getting no help from the front desk I am tempted to lower my rating to a single star. But, hey, I can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night."
"1","booked through a third party site and they tried to stick us in a queen room even though they had plenty of kings available. definitely gave attitude about it but \""upgraded\"" anyway. he wanted to charge me the difference but I refused. just bad service overall. no one to help with bags morning or night. even the day front desk person was short with us and rude. I couldn't wait to get out of there. the room was clean and charming. the area is definitely rough. I wouldn't stay here again."
"1","We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable."
"1","First I would like to say the Pasta Too of old had good food, this was just average.  The italian and mushroom steak hoagies weren't that great.  The steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun.  The pizza wasn't that good either.  The prices are higher than the food was good. $6.25 for 7\"" italian and $7.50 for 7\"" mushroom steak. So not worth it but I guess they figure they can get from the people who work at the hospital and with all the new housing going up.  I will not get anything from there again."
"2","Best pizza in the North Side by far.   Super friendly staff, too."
"2","No frills, no fake smiling employees, just REALLY GREAT BREAD. Fresh, authentic, all natural ingredients and very good prices. I regularly buy 2 baguettes here for a $1.25 or $1.50. Lots of rolls, breadsticks, rye, wheat and focaccia. It's a small store at the bakery, prices are a lot lower than at Wholey's or somewhere else in the city. Many restaurants use breadworks. Great stuff."
"2","Best in Pittsburgh hands down. Pumpernickel raisin rolls are my favorite, the ciabatta is awesome...salt sticks too. They have just about anything you could think of and it's always bakes fresh that morning."
"2","Breadworks has great bread although I usually only buy it in the summer because I make my own bread. I am rating it 4 stars and not 5 for one thing, the focaccia. They now stick it in pizza box and you can't see what your getting. The last 2 times I got it, the bread was burnt. At the price of this bread it shouldn't be burnt and it never was when you could see it before you got it home. I think I will stick to what I can see."
"2","Went here a couple Fridays ago to go to for lunch. Pretty cool place and the food was pretty good. I had the sausage platter, sauerkraut, coleslaw, and red cabbage...mmmmm! I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes. My only complaint is that the beers were a little small."
"1","I really don't know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty, the carpets, the lighting above the tables and the furniture. I have tried this place 5 times in the past 2 years and this is how it went. The 1st time I had a burger which tasted funny and I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning and was so sick. This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.Now I'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem,next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?.When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good. I no longer have to go to Billy's, my dear friend has passed away and I refuse to go anywhere near the place. To the owner-Please sell the restaurant, you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely."
"2","A trip to the Omnimax Theater is always a good time and I have never left disappointed.  The theater is massive the screen is something like 5 times that of a regular movie screen it's way bigger then the IMAX. \n\nDid you know that ever Christmas season the Omnimax screens Polar Express! I mean guys you really feel like you're riding on the train!  Seeing the Polar Express annually has become something of a family tradition for me and the little ones. \n\nAnd how cool was it that Batman the Dark Knight Raises was also screened here? The massive screen  added a layer of epic to the film viewing experience that in no way could be matched by any other theater around town. \n\nTickets for movies at the Omnimax can be purchased separately from the general admission pass to the museum.  I recall ticket prices for shows being any where for $9-$12.00. \n\nBonus it's all set up like a movie theater and is accompanied by a concession stand that serves ICEEs.  I would not suggest it for very little kids under 5 , the sound is very loud and can prove to be frightening and over whelming. I learned this the hard way."
"2","In my making of places I will visit when going to Pittsburgh the Carnegie Museum had to make the list. With the many hours spent in the adjacent library and the museum itself there is really no way I could not make time when I visit. I am not sure if what seemed like ominous dinosaur skeletons are still there or not but either way it will be a walk down memory lane to go."
"1","How to put this gently?\n\nWhile I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. \n\nIt's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. \n\nIt comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower \""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews\"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...\""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs\"".\n\nOn top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).\n\nIn sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read)."
"2","I had a week off from work recently.  I needed it to take a little break and I decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'Burgh?\n\nTo say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\n\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \""stuffed and mounted\"" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\n\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\n\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \n\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \""Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\"".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \n\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything."
"2","I was trying to decide whether to visit the Carnegie Museum of Art or the Museum of Natural History, and decided to go with the art museum first.  Lo and behold, your admission ticket to one gets you into the other at no charge, and they're connected so you don't even have to go outside.  Score!\n\nSo, two great museums for the price of one.  The art museum, even on a Saturday afternoon, was not crowded.  The galleries don't have the most intuitive layout, and I kept feeling like I was missing something as I walked through the smallish rooms.  Still, it was pretty easy to find the collections that most interested me.  The photography exhibit has some fantastic portraits and slices of Pittsburgh history.\n\nThe natural history museum, on the other hand, was full of kids of all ages running around among the dinosaur skeletons.  I spent less time wandering the exhibits of gemstones and preserved animals than I had spent with the art, but still recommend checking out the badass dioramas of North American and African wildlife.\n\nOverall, a worthwhile diversion on a larger scale than you'd expect in a city Pittsburgh's size, with a bonus museum in the price of your ticket."
"2","Us lucky Carnegie Mellon students could get into this museum for free, sooo I managed to make it here once a year. Looking back, I probably should have gone way more. The architecture of the building is so open, airy and bright. I love the layout and the gigantic staircase up to the galleries. \n\nMy favorite part - the gigantic room with all the dinosaur skeletons and the last room in the art galleries with the modern art... there's a really neat blue painting with concentric circles, which tricks your eyes into thinking it's breathing. crazy."
"2","what can you say? just have a lot of time to spend! because its soo packed with all sorts of great works and exhibitions! dont for get to take art classes! especially if you have children- there are a lot of things to do."
"2","I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum, but nothing this awesome.\n\nThe Carnegie Museum houses two very nice museums. Natural History and Art. The Natural History Museum is very impressive and it's cool knowing that all the specimens belong to the museum and they aren't on loan from some hoity-toity New York museum. It's not huge like the Smithsonian, but it's certainly cool seeing real dinosaur bones. My accompaniment had to stifle all my Jurassic Park \""Mr. DNA\"" references.\n\nThe art section is also quite impressive. I personally still prefer my Detroit Institute of Art, but this museum is still nice. I got a little confused about how to walk around. I prefer my museums in chronological order, not cool to less cool, which is what this seems to be. The modern art is very cool, but after being at the Warhol the day before, I had my fill of high-concept stuff. There's quite a bit of Impressionism, which by scientific fact all women love.\n\nThis is great way to spend a long afternoon and there's plenty to do in Oakland afterwards."
"2","Totally incredible way to spend an afternoon with my family - these museums have it all! Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend), we typically pop in for an hour or two at a time, focusing on different areas of the complex in Oakland every time we go. Our daughter seems to enjoy the dinosaurs the most, but she's also intrigued by the art collection! My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore. Don't miss out on the basement kid's room, because it's full of hands-on activities for the young ones.\n\nWe will definitely keep our membership current as the years go on - it's timeless, and always fun!"
"2","Awesome Dinos and terrific tour guides."
"1","At this point, I am done. I scheduled my kids for the last 2 weeks in August and then due to an emergency, I had to cancel, which I did a month before their camp was to start. I was told they were issuing my refund, and that was 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS and i still dont have it. I live probably 30 minutes from the museum and could have driven there 63838484848485858 times by now and picked it up. Its just sooo unprofessional and annoying. They need to get their office together and deliver refunds in a timely manner. 7-10 business days are fine but 3 WEEKS is UNACCEPTABLE for it to not have even been MAILED YET. So dissapointed and will never use them again."
"1","In response to the response I received from the Museum rep, I called and left a message and never received a reply as of yet, but you reponded on Yelp. This week is the 3rd week. your response stated that my refund was sent this week, if you are speaking about this current week, today is the 14th, monday and the week has just begun. If you are talking about last week, can you please tell me what day since leaving messages do not gain a response except to be contacted here on Yelp. Thank you."
"2","We went for friends bridal shower brunch and stayed for the art. The beauty of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh can only be described as mesmerizing. We enjoyed a beautiful brunch with flawless service. The afternoon was spent among some of the worlds best art collection. I recommend taking a tour, stopping for lunch either in the restaurant or the cafe and then finishing your day with viewing another collection. You can enjoy Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh in a day, but since the price is right why not come twice? Easy parking, friendly staff and beautiful architecture make this place one of our favorite escapes."
"2","This collection is extensive and covers so many styles and periods, there is bound to be something that grabs you. The setting alone is worth the trip. On a clear day you can see all the way from the skyline to the ocean. The gardens are a delight also."
"2","Heinz ketchup and pickles are terrific.  It isn't worth trying to save a nickel with watery condiments."
"1","Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.\n\nPizza Hut , a pizza of last resort."
"2","Ordered online and couldn't believe how fast the food came. Their honey garlic boneless wings are delicious."
"2","This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The food is consistently amazing (I highly recommend the blackened shrimp pasta), the ambiance is great for a casual or more formal gathering, and the service is tremendous.  The prices are also very reasonable.  I literally crave the food from Legends....you must check this place out!"
"2","So Pittsburgh! This is such a neighborhood gem! We took my grandmother here for her 82nd birthday and had such a good time. Nothing too fancy, just good 'ole Italian food, made in the kitchen right in front of you."
"2","Very good home style Italian... Very friendly staff. You should bring a bottle of red to go with your dinner... Worth it!"
"2","Awesome, cozy place. It has a friendly, family style atmosphere. The food is consistently great. The servers are inviting and seem genuinely happy to be there. \n\nI love going here on a whim. So if you're looking for a great new place to go tonight, try it."
"2","Another Northside neighborhood favorite! Although the physical structure and ambiance leave a bit to be desired. The food and staff surely make up for it!  The staff is always super friendly, even when you stroll in late in the evening a glass or two of wine into your night. \n\nThe food is all house made and truly delicious! The Virginia spots are one of my personal favorites. Honesty anything you try you'll be sure to love.\n\nIt is BYOB but beware of the corkage fee per person."
"1","Small, overcrowded, unfriendly staff.\n\nThe food is okay - typical Italian fair that could be better seasoned. \n\nThere are much better options nearby, but in a pinch, it's decent."
"2","This is our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is terrific, the service is top notch, they remember our names and it always feels special when we dine there. I've never had a pasta special I didn't adore. \n\nI truly feel like they are happy to see us when we come in the door and go to extra pains to treat us well and we are just an average couple who aren't spending hundreds. That doesn't matter - we are their customers. \n\nWe've been by for lunch which is very competitive price wise with nearby restaurants."
"2","I go to this place about once a month for lunch and I am consistently impressed with the quality of my meals and the service. It seems like an unassuming cafe, but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly and engaging.\n\nUsually, I will get one of their sandwiches and I am especially impressed with their chicken parmesan panini. It's obvious that the ingredients are fresh and the bread is homemade. It's the kind of meal I would expect in an New York bistro, but it is right here in Pittsburgh. \n\nOverall, this is a great restaurant if you like fresh ingredients and good Italian food. Also, the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun!"
"2","Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends, one would assume sports bar, but not so much. And I very much liked it that way! Let's roll into a pro/con list...\n\nPros:\n-Great, friendly service. Morgan was my server and she was super fantastic. Quick, efficient, sweet. She offered up helpful suggestions and even let me try a sample of the soup of the day before I placed my order.\n-Homemade focaccia: Mmmm rosemary! Tasty and free slivers of love to go with your meal. \n-Portions: Mammoth. From the bowls of soup to the pastas to the pies...sharing is caring.\n-Spinach ravioli: My main dish of choice. Flavorful spinach and cheese pillows of pasta cooked al dente and smothered with tomato basil sauce with a touch of cream. Damn good pasta, my friends.\n\nCons:\n-Menu items price out a few dollars higher than similar Italian joints. But, the value is here, though, because of the increased portions. \n-Restaurant set up/ambiance: Is a bit odd. It's kinda like a diner...with bare tables...and carpet...and a few random pictures on the wall. \n-No booze, beer or wine. It is BYO, but I didn't see the corkage fees listed on their menu.\n\nOverall, a solid place for homecooked Italian eats. I would sprint back to Legends just for that ravioli! Mangia!"
"2","How have I never been here before?  How have I never even heard of Legends?  No more.   I went here for lunch and it was delicious!  The location = little scary, especially if you would go at night.  The atmosphere = not top notch.  The food = excellent.   \n\nI was very pleasantly surprised with my entire meal.  The bread with the rosemary dipping oil was quite good.  The salad was also very tasty.  It had blue cheese and roasted red peppers which I can't get enough of and no iceberg lettuce in sight.  I opted for the spinach and ricotta ravioli in a basil tomato cream sauce.  It was very good.   Not the best I've ever had but solid.  Lots of sauce to dip more of the tasty bread in.   Did I let it end there?  Of course, not.  I had a giant slice of apple pie with ice cream.  The apples were sliced a little too thickly for my liking but it was a darn good slice of apple pie and that's coming from someone who makes an out of this world homemade apple pie.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't get much work done that afternoon because I could barely move."
"1","OK, so based off the recommendation of my date, I thought  that I would like Legends North Shore but I left dinner disappointed and in need of a mint to mask the over abundance of garlic (salt) that I had consumed.\n\nThis restaurant is in a prime location on the North Side and has plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the growth in the area. That said, allow me to jump into some of the minuses:\n\nBeans and Greens appetizer - I love beans and greens, but was shocked by the amount of garlic the chef added. Actually, I don't think it was garlic...I believe it was garlic salt (a huge no-no) Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but there was so much that it killed a simple, rustic dish.\n\nBlackened Shrimp Pasta - My date and I shared this dish. This dish tasted as though an entire container of garlic salt had accidentally been dropped onto the plate before being served. The shrimp and pasta, however, were cooked well. Had the chef backed off the garlic he would have presented a more edible dinner. i was not in the mood to send this dish back to the kitchen, but did call this out to the waitress once our meal concluded.\n\nThe restaurant is cute, in a great location, and service is friendly and prompt. These are all important things to me, but quality and taste takes precedence.  Unfortunately, Legends just didn't do it for me.\n\nWould I go back? Most likely not. There are far too many other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I would like to give a try."
"1","Its okay, but it was just ok.  \n\nThere's a $4 per person corking fee which caught us off guard.  We were expecting that would be for the table.\n\nWe started with the polenta and the mozzarella.  The mozzarella was unremarkable, deep friend mozzarella in breading.  Of course it was good, it is fried cheese!  But it was nothing special.  The polenta was a real stand out, tasted home made and was delicious.\n\nThey give you garlic olive oil and garlic bread sticks to dip in the oil.  This was free so I'm not complaining, but that just seemed a heavy and oily combo to me.  Also, the breadsticks were covered in rosemary, and I loathe rosemary.\n\nMy friend had the special, pan seared shrip over pesto penne, and she loved it.  I had this chicken dish with apricots and it was ... alright.  It was good but I felt like the searing on the chicken could have made this dish excellent.\n\nOverall I would come here again but maybe I'd stick with a staple like chicken parmigana."
"2","Very cool place to have a nice dinner.  I always go for the mussels-delicious!\n\nPasta is always fresh and tasty, too.\n\nFriendly wait staff.  This would be a five-star if they were able to serve adult beverages."
"2","I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving."
"2","What a great place to stop for a good meal before a Pirates game."
"2","This is hands down the best italian restaurant in the city.  Chef Dan makes you feel at home in this cozy little restaurant.  The open kitchen is very entertaining.  I usually get one of the specials as I have worked my way through most of the menu.  Every dish is better than the last.   The Antipasto appetizer is always a good choice."
"1","If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would. We were just asked by our waitress to leave because someone with a reservation was waiting for our table. My father and father-in-law were still finishing up their coffee and we had not yet finished our dessert! I've never been so humiliated. Do NOT go to this restaurant!\nTheir food was mediocre at best. If you want excellent Italian in a small intimate restaurant, go to Dish on the South Side. I will not be going back."
"2","If you're looking for a wide array of malt liquor and/or ice beer Caruso's is the place for you. Aside from their vast selection of high alcohol drinks they have a pretty decent selection of unique beers and all of the standards you would hope to find at a distributor. The prices are good, sometimes a $1 or $2 cheaper than other places."
"1","The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.\n\nWhat was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse, gave me a free beer to drink, and engaged me in plenty of conversation. At one point, though, he said, \""You look oriental, but you also look American.\"" I'm pretty sure he wasn't meaning for it to be offensive, and I just discounted it as his being an old man who didn't know it was no longer politically correct to say things like that.\n\nThis is not why I recommend against Caruso's, however. The reason why I'll never go there again is because Sam knowingly sold me expired beer.\n\nI was on my way back from the North Side to the East End where I live and after seeing these good reviews, I decided to stop by. I wanted a case of Yuengling, but Sam said, \""Why don't you try this instead,\"" and popped open a fresh bottle of Castello, an Italian beer. He had me drink it, all the while espousing its comparative taste to Yuengling at a cheaper price point. It certainly tasted alright, and a case of it was a couple dollars less than what Yuengling was going for.\n\nSince the Castello tasted fine, I ended up buying a case of it on Sam's recommendation. A few days later when I opened the box and drank a couple of the beers, however, I noticed that they tasted funny. That's when I looked at the label and saw how each of the bottles had its \""sell by\"" date marked out in black Sharpie. You could see the numbers underneath the Sharpie, and the dates were for well over two years ago. So basically, Sam had convinced me to buy something he hadn't been able to sell, knowing that I lived in the East End and probably wasn't going to visit again anyway.\n\nStale beer aside, there's another big reason not to go to Caruso's: Their prices are steep--$24 for a case of Yuengling. While Sam might be a more charming character than the young folks at my neighborhood distributor Pistella's, at least I know that Pistella's has significantly lower prices and actually has enough customers and product turnover that they won't purposely sell me something that's not fresh."
"1","Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.\n\nThe last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.\n\nI'm done shopping at this store."
"1","This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \""made in the 70s\"" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's."
"1","Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down, people selling who-knows-what out of their car trunk. Also this is the only Giant Eagle tht gives you a really hard time if you ever forget your advantage card and give your phone no instead (it works at the other ones just fine). Then we leave by waiting for a really dazed/swaying woman to finish wandering around back and forth in front of us, and pass by a drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) on our way out of the parking lot. We are definitely scared to return, and will never need grapes (or any other groceries) so desperately again."
"1","Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse, they are supposed to open at 7.  At 7:10, I was told they were \""still getting ready to open\"" and I should come back \""around 7:30\"""
"1","The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger"
"1","Zero stars? Really terrible store. High prices, THE WORST PRODUCE EVER (And no, it isn't the lighting...) and rude employees. \nNever mind the people hanging out out front and in the parking lot, who cares. What I'm truly concerned about is the vast discrepancy between this store and very nearly all of the other Giant Eagle locations in the Pittsburgh area. One would assume that there would be some quality control within their chain of stores. Truly sad that the North Side has so few options at which to shop for reasonably priced, fresh food. \n\nAlso, enjoy getting followed around by the walleyed \""undercover\"" employee. Looks like Lurch from the Addams Family. Good riddance."
"1","It's close to my neighborhood, hence the 2 star. \nbut seriously, it's like Walmart stuff at Whole Food's price. for the same item, it charges substantially higher (~40%+) than Target -which is not even known for cheap grocery.  \nI still go there because it's close, and I go for specific items on sale so it's not bad. But overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason! which is probably the reason it gets on my nerve the most! over the years I've frequented many pricy groceries: Andronico's (CA), Morton Williams (NY), Wegman (MD), and Whole Foods everywhere - and these stores all had one common quality: they carry nice stuff! When I want to cook pretentious gourmet food, they have every ingredient ready. I don't expect every store to be cheap and carry good stuff like Trader Joe's, ergo I was never the one to oppose stores just because they're pricy. But this one is just pricy unjustifiably. You can over charge me on truffle oil and duck confit, but I'm not happy to be charged double on corn syrup and canola oil. Same brand, same item, nearly double the price. even the CVS downtown don't overcharge as much so don't say this is for the location. This is the definition of a rip off."
"1","So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce, rotten fish, old meat, and security guards that speck you be stealin! This is the Gh**to Eagle!"
"1","This Giant Eagle is one of the few that only use the Giant Eagle name, but is owned independently of the Giant Eagle company. It is a franchise, which may explain why it is such a dump.\n\nTo shop here, you first have to get into the store, which means dodging bums and people selling EBT cards just outside the store. \n\nOnce inside, you have to find a cart that has all 4 wheels, travels in a straight line, doesn't make squeeky noises, and isn't wet or filled with trash. \n\nThen go to the produce department. Whenever I go to the produce department of any other grocer, I notice some of the produce has fallen on the floor, and some has rolled under the shelves. I'm almost positive that this produce is collected and sent to the Cedar ave Giant Eagle.\n\nThis store is not clean.\n\nTo its credit, they still have people who bag groceries for you, and the staff are decent, especially considering the demoralizing nature of their work environment. The location is also very good.\n\nIf the Cedar Ave Giant Eagle wants to improve, it needs to hire security to keep the parking lot clear of panhandlers, get new shopping carts, get rid of the self-checkout registers, improve their produce department, and have an overnight cleaning team. Until then, they will keep pushing me and everyone else to shop with their competition."
"1","The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways. I have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell \""things\"" out of their cars and at the driveway exit. If there is outside cameras, the Pgh police should take a look. I wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside. Kuhns off Brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better."
"1","I hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch, but this is definitely far from the best Eagle in the city. I'll say upfront that I never felt unsafe the three times that I have been here. However, the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor. The lines are always long and take forever to get through. Furthermore, the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par. I'd recommend stopping in another Giant Eagle if you can. However, this location DOES have a Redbox, which is nice."
"1","I've had a lot of bad experiences at this store. The employees have been rude so much that I just expect them to roll there eyes when I get deli meat. Lines are long, and there's always a crowd of people hanging out front begging for money, cigarettes, or trying to sell their food stamps. \n\nI have filed a complaint with corporate about this store before and I was contacted by a manager. I do have to say, that this manager really, sincerely cares about this store and customer experience. I talked to him for 20 minutes and he was polite and friendly. His name is Mr. Youngblood, and he urges you to ask for a manager if you're having a bad experience.\n\nProduce selection is terrible, there is not a meat counter in store, and it's just feels dirty. \n\nThis is the only grocery store on the north side, so it's not as easy to \""just go somewhere else\"" sometimes when you get off work, you don't want to drive 10 minutes to go to Kuhns on mcknight."
"1","This is a small, franchise-owned location that caters to the predominantly low income households in the area. Selection is quite limited throughout the store with limited quantities on the shelf of the items they do carry. Because of the area in which it is located, the store is NOT 24-hours as most Giant Eagle's seem to be. \n\nThe pharmacy inside the store, unlike the store itself, is corporate owned, and it's staff is friendly and efficient. A stark contrast to the rest of the store.\n\nOnce again reflecting the relatively low income of the area this store serves, there will be one of more jitney's (unlicensed cabs, effectively) waiting outside the store willing to take you and your groceries home for a small fee. \n\nIn general, if you CAN shop somewhere else, you will probably want to."
"2","Dave's Barber Shop is good old fashion at its finest!!!!  The convo was perfect, sports and everything in between....cut and price also very nice...."
"1","The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money."
"2","Best Cleaner in Pgh.!  If you have quality clothing , and want your clothing to look beautiful after being cleaned go to Pfennings !!! Excellent services !"
"2","Peanutz is a perfectly good neighborhood bar on East Ohio Street.  Their beer selection is adequate (basically all the American macro lagers, plus a few of the more widely-known craft beers, like Sierra Nevada), and their bar is stocked with the full gamut of booze (except ouzo).  Trish, the bartender, is a fantastic bartender with a hilariously sharp tongue.\n\nI haven't tried very many of the menu items, except for the chicken wings, which are a house specialty.  Everyone recommends the Four-Dip sauce, which is pretty good.  The Cajun rub is good too.\n\nDecor-wise, Peanutz is focused largely on Pittsburgh sports -- there are two large display cases with all sorts of sports memorabilia.  There's a handsome wooden bar in the front room, and a dining room off to the side."
"1","I went here on a Saturday night with a few friends.  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  I'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before, I was taking a chance.  For those that know me, I'm not the gambling kind.  \n\nBut I thought ok it's just $3 so it's not like I'd be going broke.  The music was fairly loud which made it difficult to talk and no one was dancing.  It wasn't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks.  \n\nAm I glad I checked this place out - sure, but have I been to better dance clubs/bars - yes.  If you're in the area and looking for something to do, then check it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip to go here."
"1","Get me some Peanutzz!! We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was $3. This didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money. Peanutz is a small venue. The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!! However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. I won't be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanuts."
"1","I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:\n\n1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. \n2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* \n3. Even with only 10 people in the bar, the music was absolutely deafening. \n4. You charge a $3 cover for no discernible reason.\n5. Rolling blunts is apparently kosher inside the bar, but sharing, not so much.\n\nHowever, I can't let this slide: your claw machine is BULLSHIT. That is the weakest claw of all time, and there's no chance it is EVER picking up anything in that cage. I feel violated, and I want my dollar back. \n___________\n\n*I think that's some sort of weird PA tax thing."
"1","To start, the bathrooms are DISGUSTING, with that being said I would never EAT anything here again.  This is a neighborhood bar for me.  I've been in here a handful of times, the crowd is never rowdy or out of control.  The bar area is clean and the restaurant has a very nice mellow atmosphere. I normally only drink Coor Light drafts which are 2.75!!! that's a lot of beer for less than 3 dollars.  I have had the wings in the past, before I saw what a disaster the bathrooms were.  They fry their wings to order and they come out hot and fresh. \n\nThe patrons are a older work crowd, not too may youngsters here.  \nI have enjoyed myself here and will probably be going back again this weekend."
"2","I've been here a few times. Can't beat five dollar Coors Light pitchers... \n\nThe crowd tends to be black. I tend to be white. And obviously from out of town. People are friendly. It's just a neighborhood bar. People talk to each other and have a good time. \n\nThe food is well priced and good. \n\nThe music is going to blow your ears up, if you care about that, don't come."
"1","Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer"
"2","Best place in the city to get a dog"
"1","STAY AWAY...\nWe've been 3 times over the past few years, each time we say \""let's try it again\"" followed by \""wish we'd done something else\"".\n\nReminds me of the movie line \""Run away, run very far away\""\n\nLast nite after Steelers/Jets was last straw. I hope the owner or general manager reads this. And think the health department should too.\n\nService is mediocre and slow. consistently. Waitress was ok in attitude.\n\nAfter our soup starter (good french onion soup) we waited and waited and waited and waited for our mains. Noticing us staring at her, waitress stopped by, went into kitchen, came back and said we were next. my watch said 8:31. Then her manager came by and argued with me and said we were next, then at 8:52pm the horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes to be next. In that time we watched 4 tables turn from being seated to drinks to mains to check down while we waited for our main. \n\nManager embarrassed himself. Said they were busy and working our food and he had checked and would come soon. I told him about the 4 tables turning and he said no they didn't. then I said I used to manage restaurants and know what customer service and ticket times are and he challenged me and said no I didn;t and I had no idea what I was talking about. What an idiot! First rule of restaurant business is the customer is always right.\n\nThen the food arrived. How hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms, seriously? It was two soggy fried chicken tenders from the deep fryer (not pan sauteed) over a bowl of bowtie pasta with shrooms and a sauce. While the sauce did have some marsala in it, it was full of sour cream and tasted like stroganoff and a little funny. The Penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor. We were so hungry we ate most and left.\n\n1 hour later I was sick on the side of the road from the dinner and still feel really rough this morning."
"1","The food is good and the portions are large.  The service is terrible.  The servers are just \""too cool,\"" to show any sort of hospitality.  No personality or spark.  I don't know if they hate working there or hate serving people.  It's puzzling.  Why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude?  I have been here a couple of times and it doesn't change.  They just look at you blankly, like they don't understand what you are saying.  I've never had a staring contest with a hostess before.  It's bizarre.  I wonder if they are all on Xanax..."
"1","I feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time I go that's exactly how I feel when I leave. Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.\n\nI can't say the food is bad, but it's not really great either. I will say the service is always so. It's almost as if they don't realize you have other places to go; you can just sit at their restaurant all day. On the upside the busboy's and girls are hounding your table filling your water glass after taking a sip. So if you're a horse you won't go thirsty.\n\nHonestly though. you are better off eating the park. I mean who doesn't love Manny's BBQ?"
"1","My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests...."
"1","Ugh, I hate this place.  People from work drag me here to lunch more often than I would like.  The food is overpriced.  The service is snotty and slow.  I can barely get free in under an hour-and-a-half.  The food is forgettable and the menu sparse.  They're terrible for pick-up too - even when you call way ahead, you're made to wait, and they're surly about taking care of you when you arrive for your food.  You can do better for lunch on the northshore pretty much anywhere.  Try SoHo or Finnegan's instead."
"1","The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range, but narrow the menu on Pirates game days. I tried the seared ahi tuna. It was good, but nothing memorable. The location appears to be the best thing about the place. Sitting outside on a warm evening, looking at the city skyline and seeing people walk around before a Pirates game is an interested dinner experience. But don't go for the menu."
"2","Well, everything is just grand in Pittsburgh when the October weather is so beautiful!! But we had a great 'lil Saturday lunch here at Atria's after walking our new puppy around the North Shore. They have plenty of outdoor tables (in the shade) and we grabbed a corner one with our pup. They were totally cool about it, and offered water, etc. The bf was starving per usual, so he started with the crab bisque, which he said was \""awesome\"". He also had their spicy pasta entree, while I opted for a fresh house chopped salad and a glass of pinot grigio. The salad was super fresh, and they didn't skimp on any of the \""good veggies\"". Only gripe is, I asked for no crumbled bleu cheese, and it came out with it. I didn't feel like complaining, so just picked it off. The salad definitely would have been more enjoyable for me without it (I don't eat cheese) but it was a nice size salad for the cost. It was also an Oktoberfest special, so bf got the Dunkel brew to drink. Our waitress was really nice and all in all, it was a good experience. I would definitely come back!"
"1","I wasn't expecting 4 star service. We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes before one of the servers noticed us since the hostess wasn't at her post. He took us to the banquet room and seated us at the last table in the front. The tables had plastic table cloths that have seen better days ours had holes in it and still had some caked on super stain sauce in one area. Then we waited 20 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She took our drink order and our dinner order. (pretty simple since it was a prix fix menu with only choices for soup or salad and a choice of ham or turkey and either Apple or Pumpkin Pie). She brought the drinks right away. Then 10 minutes for the salad/soup -- very tasty, but no rolls were delivered to go with and no sign of the waitress. One of the employees goes out the emergency exit door located directly behind me (BLAST OF COLD AIR) Only after finishing the first course did she bring the rolls/butter and didn't clear the dirty plates. Another 15 minutes passed before the waitress stopped by the table and cleared the dirty dishes. (THE HOSTESS COMES IN FROM OUTSIDE THROUGH THE DOOR WITH A BLAST OF COLD AIR) A minute later she came by and said our main course would be along in a minute and she proceeded to go out the door directly behind me. (MORE COLD AIR) The main course was delivered by a food runner. The turkey was tasty and just a little on the dry side and needed more gravy, but there was no sign of our waitress to even ask for more gravy. Eating as slowly as possible so as to have the opportunity to get gravy for the turkey there simply was no attention paid to us. (ANOTHER EMPLOYEE GOES THROUGH THE DOOR, MORE COLD AIR) Finally the waitress comes over and asks how was it, I explain that the cold air is too much to handle. THE EMPLOYEE WHO WENT OUT CAME BACK IN AND WE ALL GET BLASTED BY COLD AIR. She replies it is what it is and shrugs and walks away. She must have said something to the manager, because he comes over to ask how our meal was. I reply that it was just OK, that the food was good for the most part (he gave a shocked reply because I didn't say it was great) but that I was disturbed with the number of times the employees kept using the door to go outside to smoke. He seemed shocked to learn that that door was being used at all and said he'd put a stop to it. We said that we usually tip 100% on holiday meals like this since the workers have to give up a day with their family but that since the staff didn't seem to care as much about us, so we would not be doing 100% tip this time. I explained that we don't expect any kind of comp, but that he needed to know that his employees were making the dining room uncomfortable by using the emergency exit for their smoke breaks and social encounters. He said he was sorry for our experience and left the table. Our waitress eventually stopped by and we requested our pie packed to go. She delivered the pie and the bill at the same time. -- it isn't over yet. . . .  While in the process of signing the bill the hostess comes over to request the chairs at our table. I explain to her that we are leaving. She was very impatient and said she only needed a minute to take the chairs and I scolded her saying that we are leaving right away and to give us 30 seconds to sign the check and she can have all the chairs at our table she scuffed off to take chairs from an empty table and blocked our attempt to exit while she was struggling to move the chair she grabbed. We chose to exit through the main dining room and bar as should be the practice for all patrons and employees. Like I said to the manager, we consider ourselves to be fairly regular patrons of Atria's PNC Park, and Atria's Fox Chapel -- but this was the worst service I've ever for an Atria's Restaurant. I don't want anything for publishing this review other than people to be highly aware of the lack of common sense by the staff on this particular day. I'll eat at Atria's again but it will be with some trepidation and with high caution that they'll probably screw something up so I have to be on high alert to get what I pay for. Posting this on Facebook and to yelp and tripadvisor might help get the owner's attention. The place could be great if they just had proper training, rules and regulations for their staff and a dose of common sense."
"1","As your standard restaurant, Atria's has no personality: the food is blah, the service is eh, and nothing is really all that memorable.  The patio and it's proximity to the ball parks are its saving grace.  \n\nNow, let's talk about when we reserved a room for a bridal shower...  We had a fixed menu for a group of about 50 ladies.  I understand that.  But when the bride asks for no tomatoes, you as a server do not say, \""No substitutions!\"" in your meanest voice.  Lighten up, it's her day.  I ended up just taking the tomatoes off for her--and just chalked it up to another maid of honor duty.  The server also kept clearing the bride's drinks while she mingled.  This was annoying, but at least we had paid a flat fee for drinks, so it wasn't the hugest deal.\n\nOverall, the server for the bride's table was just awful and kept treating us like little children.  Yes, the table was the bridal party and the bride's cousins.  Yes, we are all under 30.  But we are also young professionals and the ones who booked the event.  The servers who waited on the rest of the tables containing the mothers, aunts, great aunts, and grandmothers were polite...even when my near-senile grandmother started yelling about bandits.  Later, another server apologized on behalf of our bad server and mumbled that, \""he just must be on his period.\""\n\nWhile Atria's is fine for a glass of wine before a Pirate's game if a table is open outside, I certainly would never book it again for a private function."
"1","Located right next to PNC Park, so is a decent place to get a beer and some grub prior to game day. That and outdoor seating are main perks. Otherwise, food and prices are not worth a stop. This place will fill up on game day, but should be avoided when the Pirates aren't in town. It isn't a BAD experience. If you are siting outside and you have a view of Pittsburgh, it can't be that bad."
"1","I have a dream. A dream that some day the North Shore will have a ton of amazing food options. I hope one day it will become a reality. For now, I think there's a smattering of okay-ish places and a lot of mediocrity. \n\nMaybe it's just the built in crowd. You come to a game, you gotta eat, right? And what are you going to eat? Either at a restaurant outside the stadium or inside. At this point I'd stick with inside for the novelty of it all. \n\nI stopped into Atria's on game day, but came in right as the first pitch was going out, so it wasn't packed in the least. Our server was obviously not into us, as well as serving that day, as she was pretty short with us the entire time. Sorry we bothered you...\n\nThe menu is incredibly limited with around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches and 5 main courses. I get that they're probably just limiting things for the crowded times, but I felt like nothing really called to me. I settled on going halfies and ordering an app and waiting until I was inside the stadium to get my \""main course.\"" Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside the point.\n\nThe pieorgies we ordered were okay. They were doused in Parmesan cheese and a little overcooked, but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't the best either. I think what really turned me off was the whole experience. Service, small selection and mediocre food. I should have just ordered two buckets of crab fries and called it a night!"
"1","Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS, a Sunday. Game at 4:30, got here at 2:30. Packed both inside and out. Can't comment on any other time but this really hectic one. \n\nOrdered Pepsi and brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, some shredded beef drenched in sweet generic BBQ sauce, a blanket of cold congealed cheese spotted with jalape\u00f1o slices. Not a degree above room temp. \n\nWill give them 1 star for tasty Pepsi and keeping it filled."
"1","Came in late night during Light the Night, just for for drinks and a snack. Service was fast, but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing. The chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot. I was excited about the crab bisque, but they must have been running low and it must have been half sherry because it tasted like I was taking a shot of cheap white wine with every bite. Hope the dinner fare is better."
"1","ok, i don't want to judge all atria's by this one. in fact, i wouldn't even judge this atria's solely by this one experience. but let me tell you, i was highly disappointed.\ni will point out the good parts of the night first. we arrived to see a band play. the entertainment was great, didn't cost extra (although there was a $20 minimum per person), and i liked the set up in the room where they played. also, the soup i got (crab bisque) was delicious!\nok, now, for the rest of the experience. first of all, our service was AWFUL. i don't know our server's name, and i know some of the wait wasn't his fault, as there was a large party upstairs. but it took at least ten minutes to even order our drinks, another 15 before we even got them. ten more minutes before we could order our food, and after the meal, we must have waited at least 15 if not 20 minutes for our check before one of the members in our party finally had to go up to our waiter and complain. i saw him checking on other tables, and it didn't seem like he had many tables to keep him so busy. as a server, myself, i always give my servers the benefit of the doubt, but it really got to be too much. the one thing i will say for him though, was that he was very nice. but for how much we waited, we should have had something comped or at least got some sort of apology BEFORE we had to complain.\nthe rest of the food and drinks were okay. good, but not enough to make up for the service. i had the berry mojito to drink and the greek salad to eat.\ni'd try another atria's before i'd go back to this one. but now i'm weary of the restaurant all together."
"2","I came here just before a Pirates game so it was extremely busy. As a result I sat at the bar. I ordered the Pacific Salmon salad and it was absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive. The price seemed reasonable. My only issues were that there were some left over plates of food nearby that were waiting to be taken away that sort of detracted from the experience. Also, my plate did not seem 100% clean although it really wasn't a big issue. Given how busy they were I do understand and still give high marks for the tasty food and excellent service."
"1","I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  What a shame."
"1","After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.\n\nGradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.\n\nThe fish \""special\"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.\n\nThey have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there."
"1","I was meeting up with 3 other people there. But I was a few minutes late.  Because I wasn't there at the time,  they refused to seat the others.  Not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered.  So they left to go to some place that would serve them (Dominic's)  This place clearly couldn't be bothered to have our business,  which seems like an odd way to run an organization.  One star because we didn't get anything that we wanted."
"1","When you walk into a buzzing restaurant, you'd expect to be greeted by someone, be that a server, a greeter or the bartender. I went in last night, stood around for almost 10 minutes, and was completely ignored. I was meeting a few friends, so I decided to walk across the street and grab a beer and make a reservation (using open table) for 45 minutes later.  Reservation confirmed, and beer finished, I walk back over, walk in to the place and someone's at the computer in the entryway on the phone. He finishes, we make eye contact, he nods and walks away. My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \""CEO doesn't like us to do that\"". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does? It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements."
"1","I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. \n-hair in the food\n-crab cakes were touted as amazing, in reality disgusting ice cream scoops of poor crab and mayonnaise \n-\""risotto\"" uncooked and congealed to plate. \n-vegetables gummy and soaked in oil. Not properly prepped and served with woody stems. \n\nI was shocked this place turns a profit"
"2","Absolutely the best!!!  \n\nNot from Pittsburgh.  Was there on vacation with my kids.  They absolutely LOVED IT.  Even my youngest, who is hard to entertain, left the place praising it.  If you have kids and are in Pittsburgh, this is a great place to take them.  We have been to other city's children's museums and this is one of the best.\n\nThere are tons of stuff for them to do.  There is also a nice variety.  Something for everyone.  Even my wife and I were entertained.  The price of admission was well worth it considering movies are about $10 for only 1-2 hours.  We were there for at least 5 hrs and it didn't even feel like it.  The best was there were activities that left you with free \""souvenirs\"".  We left with various art creations that the kids made that were really cool."
"2","Oh my God. They're playing the chicken dance song on their website! Bahaha!\n\nSo what is so great about this place? Mister Rogers of course! For those not in the know, Fred Rogers was from Pittsburgh, so of course there will be a great display of his world somewhere in the city. And here it is. \n\nBeyond that there are always cool displays up in the rest of the museem. Bottom line: Great for adults and kids alike, another of the must see Pittsburgh sites."
"2","really great place to bring kids. brought my 2 year old here on vacation and she had a blast. Her favorite parts were the painting room and the water room. a must visit if you have kids."
"2","I wish we'd had more time here - this place was a blast.  I speak from experience when I say you can keep an almost-two year old happy for AS LONG AS YOU WANT here.  There is even a little cafe so you don't have to leave if you get hungry.  I also witnessed a birthday party at which the kids were encouraged to yell and scream and be happy.\n\nSome of the exhibits could have used a little bit of maintenence.  The coolest thing we did was play in the water area, but a couple of the features were broken and the (young) museum employees didn't know how they were supposed to work.\n\nWe found street parking, but you can park on site for $5."
"2","Awesome. Nuff sed"
"1","Can't get an order right! 6 of the last 8 times we ordered they have messed it up.   I know, each time I forgive them and think they can't possibly mess up again, but they do.  Not only that, but they quote 45 minutes then take anywhere from 1-2 hours to deliver.  Wont be ordering from here again!"
"2","Stumbled on this place on a Sunday afternoon when looking for Yelp recommended Bistro-to-go across the street was closed.\n\nLittle leery - but very pleasantly surprised!  Nice tables and chairs, pleasant service and it was fairly fast.  Woman recommended a large basket of fries to share and they were great!  The Reuben sandwiches were really good!  Two of those, a Gyro, basket of fries and drinks...a $20 bill!   \n\nAbout the only thing odd was the tiling around their deli case.  No biggie.  \n\nWe'll go back, I want to try the Pizza.  It was really good food and the prices were great!\n\nOh yeah, the Pickles were excellent and HUGE!"
"2","Pickles looks like a dive. The bathroom is a disgrace to mankind. The clientele...or should I say the non-client, just sitting there bothering paying customers, are a little off putting. \n\nBUT, the food is awesome... I would not want to look too closely into the kitchen... but the food is awesome!"
"1","I lived off of pickles in college!  The only downfall was their delivery time.  It always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food, 10 minutes down the road. \n\nI moved, still in delivery distance, and had a terrible experience.\nI called my order in and had a total of 11 and some change.  I told them I'd be laying cash.  When the delivery guy arrived he couldn't stop complaining about walking up my steps and I would have to meet him downstairs next time.  When I handed him a 20 he told me, sorry I don't have any change.  So he walked off with a 9 dollar tip after being terribly late, rude, and forgot my drink.\n\nGood food, but rude service on the phone and in person. \nI have not been back since."
"1","I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind, I tried my food.  I must admit it was good.  Not great, but good.  I didn't have an issue with the place or the other patrons.  I dig that kind of place.  But if you tell someone a time, you should be able to deliver.  The food itself warrents a higher rating, but the overall experience was a disappointment."
"1","Don't do it! \n\nThe ribs are average at best. The sides are just as average as well. The bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. The greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it. \n\nThis place is almost as bad as the now closed Mr Willie's BBQ in Squirrel Hill! I had such high hopes for this place. Oh well. That's what I get for trying to cheat on Showcase BBQ in Homewood. Now those are the best ribs in Pittsburgh and some of the best in the country! \n\nThey don't take debit or credit cards. Cash Only!"
"2","One of my favorite places for take-out in Pittsburgh.  The ribs are cooked Southern style, and just the way I love them.  This is extremely satisfying slow cooked wood fire BBQ.  You have to get there early in the evening to get the chicken.\n\nThe service is quirky, but I find it charming.  The decor is \""down home.\""\n\nThe hot sauce is hotter than you might expect...so I recommend you ask for a mix, or just go for the mild.\n\nLet's just say I every so often get a craving for Wilson's BBQ, and it's always a special treat."
"2","Here we go, Steelers, he we go.  Pittsburghs goin' to the superbowl!\n\n\n\""Y'ins kicked ass this yir, playin dawn-tawn at the new stadium.\""  \n\nI love you, the best things about Pittsburgh- ever."
"2","No equal. Here we go stillers here we go!!!"
"2","I am starting to love you guys more and more. I first fell in love in 2005. I did not have a football team growing up and it took me a while to find the right one. As I started to follow your games, I became more excited, more involved. I stuck with you through thick and thin. No jumping off the bandwagon.  I look forward to watching you guys play football every Sunday. I go out of my way going to restaurants, bars, etc, just to catch your games if it is not on local tv. I am a hardcore devoted fan that appreciates all the excitement and joy you bring me along with the frustrations and anger. I will be waving my Terrible Towel, loud and proud for you guys. Bring back the Superbowl this year and every year after that! I bleed Black and Gold. Go Steelers!"
"2","Been a fan since I was a little kid.  I don't know why my dad and I, who couldn't agree on anything, both loved the Steelers.  And we were from California.\n\nBut you talk about a team for all seasons and all reasons!  It took over 40 years for me to finally get to a game out here.  Unfortunately you didn't win, but we love you still the same!  Anyone willing to wear their Steelers Gear to a Raider Game, ride BART for over 20 miles to get there and walk back to the train afterwards - is a FAN Dammit!\n\nAnd one day, the five of us are going to get in an RV and drive across the country and go to a game..... right there in Pittsburgh.  Look out!"
"2","On a less serious note, I want to thank all the bitches who keep saying Sixburgh got lucky. I waited six days to post this, one for each Super Bowl the Steelers have won. One for each Super Bowl we've exceeded the Cardinals by. One for each Super Bowl we've won that make the Steelers the best of the best.\n\nSo ya. Thanks, suckas! You're funny."
"1","1 star for your cover-2 defense that lost me $100 on the Super Bowl.  I thought yall were going to shut down Fitzgerald.  You disappointed me.  Wouldn't have mattered if that Big Ben TD didn't get called back and turned into a field goal, but damn your cover-2 D that let Fitz run wild on yall.\n\nNational Fixed League on them spread busters.  Vegas owns the NFL!  Sheiiit!!!"
"2","Not crazy about football like I use to be when I was a small fry but as far as football teams goes the Steeler are a SOLID TEAM! And their fans are crazy good crazy. Unless you come up against em and then their crazy bad crazy. So upon moving to Pittsburgh several years back I often hid the fact that I always worshiped the Dallas Cowboys for fear of being ridiculed beaten or both. If you live in Pittsburgh you will learn that it is wise to pay respect to the Steelers or else..."
"2","Not much you say about the Steelers that the sports world doesn't already know. The Steelers are the model for what all Professional Football teams strive to be. From the ownership, the players, stadium, to the fan base we have it all. The ONLY downfall of being a Steeler fan is that trying to get tickets is about as difficult as trying to catch a cheetah in the open prairie. \n\nFor those that want to experience what this is like bad can't land tickets to the game I would recommend going 2-3 hours before the game and join in the tailgating festivities. Once the game starts take your friends over to one of the many northside bars to enjoy the game. McFaddens and Bettis's are tops on that list."
"2","I'm  not crazy about football but it's a nice stadium and fun to come with other people. The games are fun and the fans are great they are very into the game which fans should be."
"2","Whoops - 6 time Super Bowl Champs!"
"2","As a '70s Raiders fan Jack Lambert's missing teeth caused me much pain as did a certain Immaculate Reception by Franco Harris. As time has passed and having visited the beautiful city of Pitssburgh, I now respect the Steelers organization and more NFL teams should be run this way.\n\nThey have great unis, cool logo only on one side of the helmet, fantastic Heinz Field and a fab base of displaced Pittsburghers all over the nation."
"2","Thanks Steelers for a great 2010 season, even though WE came up short in winning our seventh championship, you've made this city proud! We'll do it in 2011 and Super Bowl XLVI in indianapolis! Here we go Steelers, Here we go!!"
"2","Benchmark of professional football.  Most superbowls in the sport.  Have the biggest fan following of all the teams.  Picked up steam during its dynasty years in the 1970s.  Before then, the Steelers were a terrible team.  Right draft picks, right coaching staff changes everything.  Today is one of the most feared teams in the NFL.  Their play represents the city.  Tough, blue collared in which any north east resident can appreciate.\n\nGrade: A"
"1","I have been a Steelers fan as long as I can remember. I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\""\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days. So NOT COOL STEELERS!"
"2","Perfect experience for this Steelers fan from Maryland. Had the walk up tour, tour guide knew exactly what she was talking about with a great personality to match. Had a really great time :)"
"1","My friend lives near here so I came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving. The inside is super dingy deli/convenience store, so I was excited for a real, down and dirty deli sandwich. They have a lot of weird items in their grocery section which can be kind of fun to look through.\n\nI got an Italian \""hoagie\"" as I feel is the appropriate term for this ultra-Pittsburgh spot. It was bad. Totally skimpy on the meat, and it had American cheese and mayo, which don't go well with Italian meats at all...provolone and oil & vinegar would have made way more sense. The bread was a squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it. It made me kind of sad. It was just a sad, floppy excuse for a sandwich. At least it was cheap?\n\nMaybe I should have gotten the chipped ham instead, since that's what they are famous for. I also suspect the location in the North Hills has to be at least marginally better...this Isaly's is clearly past its prime."
"1","Out of business."
"1","It's cathartic to give this sorry organization 1 star.\n\nNote: this is a review of the baseball club, not the stadium in which they play"
"1","O my Pittsburgh Pirates.  What a storied history you have!  But the last time you went to the post season was in 1992,  and I remember it well.    I worked as a ticket taker at the old Three Rivers Stadium and I have such fond memories of working there.  I was 17 when you won your last divisional title and I don't think you've had a winning season in my entire adult life.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my Bucs!  I do love you so much.  In a way, I have to.  See, you're like the boy I knew in grammar school who was such a sweet kid, but he was constantly failing his classes--and he lived in a nice house!  \n\nLet's take a look at your records since 2000.  I warn you dear Pirates--it won't be pretty.  But it's something you have to come to terms with:\n\n2001:  62-100 (last pl)\n2002:  72-89 (4th Pl)\n2003:  75-87 (4th pl)\n2004:  72-89 (5th pl)\n2005:  67-95 (last)\n2006:  67-95 (5th pl)\n2007:  68-94 (last)\n2008:  67-95 (last)\n2009:  62-99 (last)\n2010:  56-101 (last)*     *As of 09-29-2010\n\nSo that's six seasons in last place, two 100 loss seasons, and this season has been the worst so far.\n\nYes, I'll still go to your games next season.  I'll still go with my husband, my co-workers, and my Girl Posse.  My dad and I will still have our father-daughter nights out here.  But like the parents of that sweet little boy in grammar school with the failing grades, you're really trying my patience.  And don't forget, the Washington Wild Things have been wooing me for the longest!"
"2","We're over .500 so far this year!  Whoo-hoo!  We're actually mediocre!  And for once the Cubs are keeping us out of last place instead of the other way around!"
"2","I love the buccos, win or lose.  Going to the games are always a good time, and when they are on TV at the bar, I always find myself happy to enjoy my meal and watch the game.  Gotta love them battling bucs.  Please just let me see one round of Playoffs in Pittsburgh before I die.."
"1","Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man, weren't we in first place at the All-Star Break?  What happened?  I wasn't expecting a World Series Champ or even a Pennant winner.  But was a winning season too much to ask for?  This marks the 20th anniversary since the Pirates' last winning season.  That's right folks--it's been since 1992.  Let's take a look at the world of 1992.\n\nBASEBALL:  The Pirates' roster that year included Stan Belinda, Doug Drabek, Zane Smith, Denny Neagle, Jay Bell, Orlando Merced, Andy Van Slyke, and of course Barry Bonds.  All have since retired.  The only new ballparks were New Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) and Camden Yards.  No stadiums had corporate names.  The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies, the Miami Marlins, and the Tampa Bay (Devil) Rays didn't exist.  The Washington Nationals were the Montreal Expos.  The Milwaukee Brewers were in the AL.  Both the NL and the AL only had two divisions each.  The minor league Washington Wild Things didn't exist either and nor did their league.  KBL was the big cable sports channel.\n\nTV:  \""Saturday NIght Live's\"" cast included Dana Carvey, Ellen Cleghorne, Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Mike Myers, Kevin Nealon, Phil Hartman,  Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and David Spade.  \""Seinfeld\"" hadn't become a huge hit yet and no one knew Kramer's first name.  Monday nights on NBC included \""Murphy Brown\"", \""Evening Shade\"" and \"" Northern Exposure\"".\n\nMOVIES:  The top movies included \""Lethal Weapon 3\"", \""Basic Instinct\"", \""Hone Alone 2\"", \""The Bodyguard\"" and \""Aladdin\"".  When you wanted to watch movies at home, you had to rent them from the video store and you watched them on VHS tapes or laserdiscs.  \n\nMUSIC:  Bruce Springsteen released \""Lucky Town\"" and \""Human Touch\""  on the same day.  R.E.M. had \""Automatic for the People\"".  Gin Blossoms released their first album \""New Miserable Experience\"", which stayed on the charts for almost two years.  Bare Naked Ladies \""Gordon\"" featured the cult classic \""If I Had a Million Dollars.\""  You either listened to albums on cassette or CD and you bought them at record stores like National Record Mart.  Doug Hopkins (Gin Blossoms), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Shannon Hoon (Bline Melon) and Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) were all alive.\n\nTECHNOLOGY:  Few people had internet access.  You also used pay phones because you didn't have a cell phone.  You watched movies on a VCR.  You met up with your friends without texting them.  You ordered merchandise by \""sending in\"" or by calling an \""800\"" number.  You had to buy tickets by waiting in line.  \n\nAnd OJ Simpson was still a football hero.\n\nSo that's it, Pittsburgh Pirates.  I feel like telling you I'm done with you guys.  I'm no fair weather fan, but 20+ years of losing is enough."
"2","I've lived in Pittsburgh for 20 years and JUST discovered St. Anthony's Chapel.   A friend of mine was visiting from NYC and, though not at all religious, he's an antiques and history freak.  He discovered SAC and urged us to take him there.\n\nThis is home to the largest collection of relics open to the public in the world and to a life-sized version of statuary of the Stations of the Cross.  The experience is breathtaking.   The tour guides -- free tours Sat through Thu at 1, 2, and 3pm -- are extremely knowledgeable and open to any and all questions.\n\nWe were just blown away by the rich history and beauty of the place plunked down in the middle of a rather ordinary corner of the North Side.\n\nIf you have guests in town looking for something out of the ordinary or if you've never been, it's well worth the schlep."
"1","I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice), and have always been fascinated by relics and the stories of saints--so I was really looking forward to our tour of St Anthony's. BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who \""led\"" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our \""charisms\"" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics. After an hour of his sermon--and nary a single fact about the hundreds of relics that surrounded us--we left. What a disappointment. What a huckster."
"1","Jason, you are right on the money!  Scaife is part of the ultra-right-wing bunch.  I certainly don't bemoan an individual's right to his/her politics (I'll admit I'm a little left-of-center), but this Scaife guy makes Rupert Murdoch look like Al Gore.  And your tabloid comments are oh, so true.\n\nI do give it two stars because its......oh, wait a minute.... can't think of a reason for two stars.  So I'll just give it one!"
"1","I wouldn't pay attention to the Trib's news coverage, since it's mostly far-right propaganda. Two stars for their decent sports coverage - Mike Prisuta and Joe Starkey are worth reading."
"2","Much better than Pravda, er the Gazette."
"1","This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city."
"1","So, this is what happened.\n\nI went their complaining about a possible over heating and requesting a change of oil. This was my first visit there. They topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil. I had a check engine light on for which I knew the code and was holding off on repairing it. \n\nThey charged me $20 for reading the check engine light code and turning it off. I didn't want that. I pointed this out on the bill and he said that, its fine, I can just pay for the oil change (~$42). He asked me if I had $42 cash on me. If I did, I could have paid and left a happy customer. But I didn't, so I gave him my card and he went in the back and swiped it for the full price ($42 + $20 + tax). When I was signing the transaction receipt, I told him that he swiped for the full price. This apparently pissed him off a lot, he very rudely handed $20 from his pocket and asked me to \""Get out of there\"" - and walked out. I tried to talk to him and explain my reason of asking - it not being the matter of $20 but of the principle that he said he wasn't going to charge me for what I didn't want. But he wouldn't listen, was very rude and said \""You're Done\"" and \""Get out\"" more times. I left. \n\nI ain't going back where they treat customers like that."
"2","I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!"
"1","Although I've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro, I wish I would have gone elsewhere. Since I can only comment on their gyro; here goes... First, the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something), second; they don't include enough dressing, third; there are way, way too many onions, forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe, fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty, sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita, - to be quite honest, it just tastes bad."
"1","Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad."
"2","Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!"
"2","This place is fantastic!  Very reasonably priced, they do a wonderful job with my German Shepherd.  Nails, ears, bath, and grooming- she looks like a new woman when they're done with her!"
"1","\""grossest hostess\""\nOkay, so you know when you go into  place and it's close to closing time?  You aren't sure whether the staff will be cordial and inviting or straight up rude.  Well my wife and I went into Millers at 9:15 pm for dinner.  The hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat.  she said \""ughhhh you know it's close to closing time, right\""?  my wife said, \""what time do you close\""?  The older, short blond curly haired hostess with glasses said \""we close at ten\"".  TEN???  TEN????  They weren't closing for 45 minutes!!!!  This was the second time she did this to us and it will be the last because they have lost our business for good.  We even heard a phone ring at quarter to ten and she didn't even answer the phone, she just picked it up and snarled \""closed\"" and hung up on the person!  Our server however, was spot on and the food was decent but the hostess or manager or whatever she was left the worst taste in our moths and spoiled Millers Seafood forever.  If you go to Miller's Seafood and you see her at the front, turn and run!"
"1","I have eaten here twice. Both times I thought the food was sub-par. The first time was a birthday lunch that was lousy, but I was feeling under the weather, so I gave it another try about a year later for dinner. It was just as lousy as the lunch. My wife definitely agreed, and although we can walk there in 15 minutes, we will never eat there again."
"1","After seeing a Google Offer for Miller's, my Mom mentioned how she had been there before and remembered good food and fond memories from her childhood.  So I offered to go with her and see if the food was still as good.  \n\nOnce we were seated and greeted by our waitress, we presented the paperwork for our Google Offer.  The waitress handed it to the hostess.  I guess they have to call for us to redeem it/verify that it's legit.  Well apparently one of the numbers was missing off the print-out and the hostess could not have been more rude about it.  In the end she talked to someone and figured it out, but she made it seem like we did something wrong.  Or, she could have told us there was a problem but then politely taken care of it since it is her job and there wasn't much else going on for her to do.  Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.  I later noticed signs up all over the place about restrictions with restaurant.com offers - I guess they have several patrons who use those regularly.  Apparently with this kind of reception, no one wants to pay full price.\n\nMom and I both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was creamy and the fish sandwich was a large portion and very tasty.  I ended up having to eat mine with a knife and fork, not even attempting to lift and eat it as a sandwich.  We left with full and happy tummies.\n\nTo comment on previous reviews....yes, this is not the cleanest place.  But I expected that and find it part of the charm.  The smoke from the bar is no longer an issue as a closed door separates the bar area from the dining room.\n\nOverall, it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich.  I'd like to give it 3 stars at least, but the whole attitude from the hostess still left a bad taste in my mouth that the mac n cheese couldn't wash away."
"1","I've been there twice, and they have yet to impress me. The decor is old and dingy at best, the seats are gross, and the carpet looks to be 30 years old and identified to my grandma's. My biggest issue was the food. I just assumed that a sea food restaurant would serve fresh fish, but I was sadly mistaken. Every meal I, or friends, have had here was poorly prepared, greasy, and clearly had been frozen for an extended period of time.\nThe only plus side of the place was that it was dirt cheap, but be prepared to get what you pay for."
"1","I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  The place is dated and could use updating.\n\nThe waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.\n\nThe food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home, but when it was served, I told her that there are variations to it.  Her first bite she made a sour face.  My son and I then tasted it...understood the face after that.  Way too much lemon juice in it, soaked in oil and not quite sure what the seasoning was, but seemed like pesto.  The pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there. \n\nMy son and I had the fried seafood platter.  Aside from overcooked breading and soaked in grease, the oysters were raw, and the battered fish had no flavor.  The breaded shrimp tasted weird too.  Needless to say, none of us finished our food. Underneath the food, the plate had a puddle of grease. \n\nOn the upside, the coleslaw, bread, and crab cake was good.  The make and cheese was edible, but seemed to comparable to Stauffer's.\n\nThis was our first, and more than likely, our last, visit.  For a $65 dollar meal, it wasn't worth $10. ."
"1","I worked at millers back in the nineties. The fish was fresh every day from wholeys, the bread was fresh everyday from mancini's, and the perogies were made by little old babushka women at St. George's down the street. \nIt was a great place to eat. People cared about the food and it showed. I can only attribute it's decline to a change in ownership. \nI stopped in to satisfy a craving for fish and was very disappointed by the grease pile I got instead. \nI used to be proud to cook there. Now I wouldn't put it on a resume for fear that people have experienced it lately."
"2","been ordering chubbys for over ten years.  solid pizza at a great price.  one time, steve offered to deliver a pizza over an hour after they closed on xmas eve just because.  doesnt get any better than that."
"1","Ordered a lg pizza for pick up, 30-40 min wait. Went to pick up my pizza and I arrived to have no pizza at all. They told a driver must have taken by accident. The skinny, is it took an hour for a new pizza, and they offered me nothing"
"1","Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy, at best. Staff was really rude both times."
"1","We just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we'd try them out. Their prices are great but, seriously, worst customer service I've ever seen. I walked in and the guy had to finish his cell phone game before helping me. I get home and realize we were given the wrong pizza. When I called to see if they had our correct one the guy tells me that's what we ordered. I assured him we didn't, I was there when my girlfriend called the order in. He just said \""sorry man\"" and didn't offer any solutions. So we just picked off the garbage toppings that we didn't order and threw most of it away. It would've taken very little effort to fix it for us. All this after it took them an hour to make the thing. I'd go back if I were desperate but it's seriously amateur hour."
"1","Too much cheese on their pizzas, and the customer service is incredibly poor.  This is nothing new, we have been in Brighton Heights for many years.  My husband LOVES their buffalo chicken pizza, but after his last experience waiting over an hour for pick up, we would only order from Chubby's if every other local pizza joint was closed."
"2","Even though I lived out in Bloomfield, I chose to drive out to this vet because I'd heard good reviews about Dr. Dorn's handling of rats and other small exotic breeds. I had two rats and Dr. Dorn was excellent with both. He was the best vet I could have hoped for. \n\nWith rats, it's sometimes hard to find (even highly experienced) vets who understand that a rat has a personality and bonds with its owner to the same degree as a dog--many people act like pet rats are just large gerbils. Dr. Dorn understood, and never made me feel silly about being anxious about them. He calmed my pets down and they loved him immediately, even falling asleep during the exam. He never tried to up-sell, and when one rat had an operable tumor (a $200 surgery) he didn't make me feel guilty for choosing euthanasia instead (he was a very old rat). When the time came, the entire staff was incredibly patient with me, and let me spend as much time as I needed in the private exam room with my rat. Afterwards, they even sent me a condolence card. \n\nThe vet techs were all professional and cheerful. The small office seemed like a friendly, casual environment. Exams for a rat were around $60 with medicine and so forth... I can't remember the specific prices, but they seemed reasonable. They were always able to see me on the same day I called. If I hadn't moved out of town, I would certainly still be making the lengthy drive from Bloomfield to get here--it was worth it."
"2","My dog means the world to me and I couldn't imagine anyone better to handle her care than Dr. Dorn. I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. \n\nMy first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment, plus medicine, plus taking out her stitches (for free) was $45. I was in shock! It was very reasonable.\n\nNo matter where you live in the city, I highly recommend Dr. Dorn!"
"2","We had food delivered to our house last night from Knossos. I tried their pierogi which I found to be quite good. Also tasty are their broccoli bites and their huge ice cream sandwiches (homemade). Very recommended!"
"1","This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro, I was waiting for him at the table outside near the street with a drink and hotdog I had gotten elsewhere, there was absolutely no one else in their establishment. The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro. He canceled his order and we sat at the friendly place next door. Not only did Knossos lose my boyfriend's business that day, but they also lost both of us as future customers. What a petty and pathetic place."
"2","Honestly, it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside it's a tiny greek diner, albeit some \""Americanized\"" choices on the menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro!\n\nBut if you are craving for a fixin' of some stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, or halushki, this is your place. And for dirt cheap too. I think our total bill was like $10. \n\nObviously you'll get the traditional gyro's here as well, with the twist of the buffalo chicken one. Obviously, I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream, which if I wasn't so full from my meal, I definitely would have indulged in!"
"1","Very disappointed. Delivery was late, our gyros were cold and fries were soggy. I wont be ordering from here again."
"1","Awful poor excuse for a gyro. Food is always soggy. Meat is pure horsec*ck. Very unfriendly staff, but what do you expect from Greek f@ggots. Will never order from here again, total trash."
"1","Called on a Tuesday to inquire about replacement sheet of glass for my TEC grill. The gentleman who answered the phone said it would cost $149, take about 3 weeks, and he wanted 50% down to place the order. Then I called TEC directly. TEC said it would be $70 and I'd get it by the end of the week. It arrived today, Friday. Talk about price gouging!"
"2","Love this place.  I used to live within walking distance and that was a treat!  Karaoke is a great time.  The drinks are great and inexpensive and there are always great people to meet there.\n\nI miss the pickles.  ;)"
"1","This place is terrible and the management has acted like an entitled prick every time I was there lol... Id rather get shot at R Bar"
"2","What a hidden gem in the South Hills. This fun Little store carters to a wide range a spiritual curiosities. You can explore your psychic side with a modest selection of power crystals, tarot cards and scents. I found the selection of books to be helpful and spanned a wide range of interest."
"2","Great shop in Dormont - very large with lots of variety.  Seems to cater to all different walks. The shopkeepers are always very friendly and helpful.  They have a great collection of candles, beads, and herbs.  My only complaint, ironically, are their stones.  The jewelry is nice (and arguably the largest collection in the city for this type of store), but the tumbled stones are buried deep in the back of the store in such gloom you can barely make them out.  They also look like they were tumbled by a lawnmower.  It's such a shame.  I wish they would bring the tumbled rocks out into the sunlight and stock up with some fresh stones.  Other than that though, they're doing a great job and we enjoy visiting often."
"2","I have to say, as far \""new age bookstores\"" go, this one is the most impressive shop I have had the privilege to visit thus far. Moonstones is deceptively small looking from the outside, but on the inside there are as many things to see as there are spiritual paths. \n\nAfter years of searching, I found a pendulum! I was so surprised to find the unassuming tiny metal acorn literally jump at me! I had assumed that what I needed would be an ornate crystal pendulum, but \""great things come in small packages\"". After I took it home it took no time to get acquainted with it. \n\nThe store contains many crystals, gems, jewelry, oils, and even jars of dried herbs. There were around 60 different bumper stickers to chooses from. And hard to find matchstick incense. It is exactly what you think, a match you strike that burns as incense. Speaking of which, I was disappointed to not find any \""pick your own\"" incense sticks. My supply is quite depleted, and I need more. I did but a very dainty scarf from the selection of hats and clothing on the top most floor of the labyrinth. \n\nI hope to attend one of the interesting classes that I have seen mentioned. It does appear that the list needs to be updated. \n\nI also LOVE how the shopkeepers don't keep a hawk's eyes on you. Instead they allow you to spend your time browsing the merchandise alone. After all, it is difficult to hear a small voice when an item is calling out to you if you are anxious from unwelcome stares."
"2","Moonstones is an excellent shop. I am from out of town but was able to order a gift basket of incense, stones and oils over the phone and have it delivered to a sick relative nearby.  Tell them what/who you need it for (e.g. a sick friend) and they will personally construct the gift basket and deliver it if not too far away Worked perfectly for me and--again--they are very nice. Ask for Amy."
"1","you can't beat a fairly centrally-located grocery store that is open 24-7 BUTTT the smell in there is ughhh.  Years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc.    You get the picture .    The high-point is perhaps the hot foods that you can get over in the deli.-area.  Some really good \""soul-food\"" .  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and etc... I will go out of my way for that stuff, sometimes ..."
"1","Kuhn's is really the only convenient grocery for where we live and they do have a great selection of higher end lunch meats, etc., but I had a terrible experience with their poultry. It took several minutes to sort through the grey, fatty boneless, skinless chicken breasts and when I finally found a package that didn't appear to have spoiled, I came home to find that the breasts had never been cut into breasts. There were several large pieces with a ton of trimming to be done. Drive the extra distance to Giant Eagle if you need anything from the meat department."
"2","Kuhn's automatically receive 1  for being open 24 hours. Beyond that, customer service has been great, the shelves are stocked well, prepared food and deli items are better for you than fast food with better ingredients at a better value! When I'm in the the are, this is my go-to shopping spot."
"2","Really nice place.  We shop here all the time. great service, great selection."
"1","Had a friend who went here. REALLY BAD experience"
"2","Best shop by far in the South Hills.  Purchased a Cannondale 29er there, and have had numerous service visits for various bikes.  Always helpful and always call to let you know when service is fixed.  If you are in the market for a Cannondale in the South Hills this place has better customer service BY FAR than the other South Hills Cannondale dealer."
"2","Okay these guys are really good guys, they provided free bike tune-ups along the MS 150 route if you guys are familiar with that. I had an issue with my ride within 200 miles of riding and brought it in and they only charged me for parts,no labor. I really appreciate their demeanor and customer service they provided to me. I never get a pretentious d-bag attitude when I come here."
"2","Absolute best place to buy a quality bike in Pittsburgh. The staff really loves cycling and shares their extensive knowledge with you to help find the best bike for you. I didn't feel like I was being up-sold anything. I really trust this place. Frequent customer for life."
"2","Nice, quiet neighborhood coffee bar.  However, the elementary school a block away gets out at 3:25, and from 3-4 it can be crowded with moms and younger siblings stopping in to pass the time.  Outside those times, it's always quiet with nice music and delicious pastries."
"2","Good coffee, nice walking street, good selection of teas and little gifty things, good pastries, *excellent* scones, and it's not that other green-logo'd coffee place."
"1","Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God, the cupcakes are the worst EVER!!!  There is a bakery right beside them; they should really consider selling the bakery's sweets or none at all.  I think a fake/display cupcake would have been fresher... and maybe even taste better.  Yes, it was that bad!  Mr. Manager... try your stuff before you sell it!"
"1","I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually, I bought coffee and espresso and two lattes and something to munch on (not all for me I had a friend with me). When I ordered the 2nd latte I sat down and realized I didn't have any foam so went back to the counter to ask for some and and she wanted to charge me!? Really!? Maybe it sound petty to you but I like my lattes fixed a certain way and foam is the best part! It's all about customer service and considering I had just spent over $25.00 a little foam wasn't much to ask. Good coffee. Bad customer service."
"2","First,  I love CTR's coffee.\nSecond,  this location has great batistas and it's less congested than other CTR'S I've been to. \n\nThat about covers it"
"2","It's past 10pm, we're hungry, coming home from a wedding party that served small portions of non-edible food. We're visitors from the West Coast, know nothing of the area. Yelped for an establishment that is open late, and still serves food within a 2-mile radius from our hotel. Voila! Yelp has sent us to Huddle. Not only did we get some bomb-ass fish and chips, we got stiff drinks for cheap. WOW! I wouldn't mind coming back here just to hang out if we're in town again. Only thing is it's cash only. Good thing we still had some handy."
"2","Who doesn't love being able to walk across the street to an awesome dive bar with a GREAT menu!\nMy husband and I used to go to The Huddle once a week... They have REALLY good wings (also wing nights) and food, including daily specials.  The soup was always a must have, with seafood chowder being my favorite.  I always ended up ordering way too much food because it is so reasonable priced.  We'd spend $30 tip included (always at 25% because that's what a good waitress deserves) and leave with boxes of food! Definitely a place to be checked out!!!"
"1","I like the double cooked wings, but they're like chick wings they're so mini.  The thing that turns me off the most about this place is they have cardboard disposable bowls for their complimentary popcorn - however they get upset if u try and use it to put wing bones or other things in it because they insist on wiping out & reusing the disposable bowls. Disgusting & totally unsanitary IMO. If they insist on reusing those, imagine where they are cutting corners behind closed kitchen doors. I'd go back for bottled beer, that's about it."
"1","... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)\n\nI have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with \""yinzers\"" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. \n\nWe have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a \""U\"" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. \n\nThis is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the \""full\"" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and \""tanned\"" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) \n\nMy dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to \""hangry\"" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).\n\nYes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle."
"2","Best salon in Dormont, if not the city."
"1","Another ugly haircut like everywhere in Pittsburgh. For $60 with the owner. Trusted the reviews, but now look like a Pittsburgh redneck. No hair on the sides and long on the back!"
"2","I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63, I got soup, salad, vegetables tempura, 6 avocado rolls, steamed rice, and pickles.  It was a ton of food and more than filling enough - I didn't even eat the salad and I was stuffed.  I will agree that the wasabi was pretty weak - I added tons of it and it added almost no spice or flavor.  Even though it was a bit pricier than I was expecting (my menu was outdated and said the lunch would be $6.95.  Oops.), it was also very filling and worth it for a once-in-a-while treat."
"1","sushi was dry and unenjoyable. the place itself is clean and the decor was minimal.  I was not a fan and probably won't be back."
"1","Well, finally tried the place with the Green door and High Step!  Always seem to be people going in and out.  Heard from one of my kids it was just OK, cause he had take out once with some buddies.  Well, we ventured in and ordered a few things so we could share.  General Ts0's chicken was  to be crisp and Ouch spicy...Well, the outer crust was crisp, chicken was hard..hard to chew, tasteless and somewhat sweet sauce???  The Shrimp Lo Mein was Ok but the shrimp was overcooked.  The Moo Shu Pork was forgettable."
"1","Yeah, don't order from here, unless it's for dumplings. since they arev fast and the potstickers are really good. Everything else we had sucked. Shrimp and Scallop with garlic was bland as hell. The Beef on a Stick was liked eating a marinated shoe with a skewer in it. Yuk."
"1","Pool hall and pretty crappy bar. Not much else to write home about. Was not a fan and won't be back here."
"1","Brought the family to Tom's last weekend, and was disappointed.  On the positive side, the prices were excellent, much better than the canonical breakfast spots in the strip.  However, the food was heavy, greasy, and made from mediocre ingredients.  I didn't care for the spinach  / feta omelet, the kids' pancakes were heavy, and the home fries were greasy.  True, the place felt 50s, but kind of worn out.   We won't go again."
"1","Below par diner food. Fried zucchini is all breading and no zucchini. Anything fried always comes dripping in grease, I know, I know it's diner food but it doesn't have to be so greasy it makes you physically ill. I'm a big fan of blt's and there's is pretty poor. Small portion with very little meat and dry bread.\n\nBesides the food, the service is so so. Last time I was in I asked for a lemonade and the waitress forgot it, asked for mayo and there was none on my sandwich, and this was on a slow day\n\nWith eat n park down the street and Pamela's not too far away it seems you have much better places to get you're grub on. I'm giving it one star because I can't see myself ever coming back or recommending the place to anyone else."
"1","I know Tom's is a South Hills staple, but other than the convenience of it being open 24 hours a day, I'm not impressed. Even by greasy spoon standards this isn't great. The wait staff is hit and miss. Some are friendly and attentive (there's an awesome Greek lady there that I love), but just as often drinks sit unrefreshed for an entire meal and I can't get anyone's attention to prepare the check. The food is really bland (hard to make a boring grilled cheese, but they manage it) and priced pretty high for what it is. I've been there five or six times in an effort to find a reliably good menu item, but I've given up. It's just bad."
"1","I've given this place enough 2nd chances and have had my last meal at this DIVE.\nFood is mediocre at best and you can't get any service because the \nwait staff is always outside having a cigarette. Very unappetizing to watch\nthem and the cook smoking then come back inside and NOT WASH THEIR\nHANDS. DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","After living in Seattle and going to a number of amazing diners, I was thrilled to find Tom's. It tends to be a little greasy, but I love the food. I've been there at least 6-7 times, never a bad experience.\nDISLIKED that the bathroom is hard to find without asking.\nPERFECT hangover food. \n\nI will be back!"
"2","Excellent food and a great Dormont staple. Open late so that is awesome. Just had their wings for the first time. I have to say, The wings are scrawny, but the sauce is great. So great that it almost completely makes up for the lack of wing size. The gyros are excellent too. Great prices and great food."
"1","Tom's Diner is one of those places I really, really want to like. You see it when driving down the street and it looks like a cool, retro place that got picked up from the past and dropped in the present next to the chain stores and abandoned buildings lining the rest of the street. If only the experience here matched the charming exterior.\n\nI don't have a problem with the diner food, first of all; it's not great, but hey, for cheap eats, it's not bad. They make a mean French onion soup, I admit. \n\nMy problem is more with the maintenance of the place. The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.\n\nThe biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. \n\nSeriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh. Ketchup is mandatory.\n\nI may poke in for a quick bite again, but I'll be honest with my final opinion: considering how mediocre my experience was on a slow Saturday night, I suspect some fast food chains could knock Tom's out of the park on a busy day at this diner."
"2","Any place where I can crack up, cut up, let my hair down and be loose is a place I love to be. It's a diner , kinda of self explanatory seeing as to how that's part of the name.  So they have your typical dinner fare, breakfast items, sandwichs CHICKEN TENDERS.  You get it, I don't need to explain a diner to you. \n\n\n Don't judge me I'm usually wasted upon arrival to Tom's Diner it's not a place where I plan on ending up just a place that I manage to get lol.\n\nAnyhow the pancakes are good and the wait staff is down to earth and very tolerant. \nIn my opinion it's not worth a trip across town, but with friends in Dormont it's a sure stop if I'm visiting over that way. \n\nEnjoy!"
"1","I came in and a waitress came to our table , took our order and then walked away. Another lady came to us and asked what we wanted , then the first girl came back and asked us again!!! The restaurant has 4 people. This is not good! Write it down you dumb blonde"
"2","I stopped by Monday, the first day I felt it was nice enough to take my munchkin for a stroller ride.I like the simple clean layout of this place,no clutter and you can see a lot of the kitchen always a good sign. I asked the woman working the counter for suggestion. She pointed out the chocolate thumbprints and while she bagged those up I spied individual pineapple upside down cakes. So I scored 4 cookies and 2 lil cakes. The cookies were very good mixture of firm and gooey. The cake was realllllly delicious.Moist with a crispy kinda crust outside,just perfect. My husband did get his cake but i really had to restrain myself because he left it for over 24 hours! I ate all 4 cookies."
"1","Read my first review... loved this place... Today I stopped in to look around,my niece was with me and I remembered that they had help wanted postings somewhere.. she inquired and the teenage girl behind the counter was SO rude, full on glaring and rolling of the eyes! NO JOKE. I wish that the manager had been in but hopefully she keeps track and knows what her counter staff is like when she is gone! I will go to party Cake shop from here on...There are too many great places to put up with attitude!"
"2","I stopped in after breakfast at The Dor-Stop to see what they had to offer.  Potomac has yummy pastries at a good price.  That's pretty much all I can say.  They have a wide variety of goodies to choose from, something to make everyone happy I'm sure.  It seemed like every time I asked, \""What is that?\"" I wouldn't even let the woman behind the counter finish her description before I would reply, \""I'll take one of those.\""  I will definitely return."
"2","One of the best pastries I've had in my life I got here. I think it's called a \""French bearclaw.\"""
"1","Pastries are nice but I bought a cake for my sisters bridal shower and they PUT THE WORDING ON THE CAKE INCORRECTLY! it was a Saturday and \""could not call a baker in to fix it so they could refund me the cake and just take this one, go somewhere else to buy a new cake, or try to fix the writing ourselves and just remove the word that was INCORRECT.\"" I spent hours on the phone with the manager and she was not very helpful or empathetic to the situation.  \n\nI then went to go pick up another cake for my sister for her husbands birthday and THE CAKE TOPPLED OVER IN THE BOX IN THEIR OWN FRIDGE!  I asked the lady if this happens often and she goes nope your just \""special\"".  Being really rude about it.  They patched the cake up and THEN showed me the cake and THERE WAS A WOODEN STAKE IN THE CAKE to \""keep it together\"".  I then said that there is a hole in the cake now and the counter lady said, \""Just smooth the hole over with your finger a little bit.\"" \n\n\nThe counter girls are always rude.  I honestly think they don't like me because they are nice to everyone else but myself. But if I would suggest I would NOT go here."
"2","Ok , SOOOO I feel the need to try these places ! Please let me know if you agree ?\n\nhttp://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-doughnut-shops-in-pittsburgh/\n\nI just made a stop here on my way to work this morning as my first Donut challange.\nThese guy's KNOW how to make a big man SMILE ! \nWhat A NICE selection , great people , Excellent yummie donuts.\nAll I can say to Potomac Bakery so far is WOW !\nI intend to try the other Bakery's on CBS's list , and I'll keep ya updated ."
"1","We were having a Gender Naming Party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family. When we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order. The mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby! Without her husband! This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive, condescending, and there was no effort to compensate her for her pain in finding out the gender at the bakery. We have done wedding cakes here, and many special events over the years. Never again!! Potomac Bakery you should be ashamed."
"2","Their baked goods are simple and DELICIOUS. The taste speaks for itself, no frills necessary. Potomac is the best bakery in the South Hills. \nLifelong regular here and I will always be!"
"2","A Dormont treasure!  We love their cookies and pastries, going there for goodies is a time honored special treat."
"1","This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel."
"1","I've never been to Pittsburgh before and I planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so I booked this hotel the day before I drove up. I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.\n\nI checked in around 2am, the girl who checked me in barely said anything to me besides \""initial here and sign here and your room is over there\"". The room smelt like hot dogs, the AC wasn't working at all so I was dripping in sweat all night, none of the lamps worked at all, there were holes in the pillow cases and bedding, there was a tiny blood stain on the sheet, I went down for the continental breakfast at 9:30am (it ends at 10am) and they already stopped serving, the shower was ice cold. I then checked for bed bugs after realizing the shithole I spent the night in last night (coast is clear). I checked out and went back to Baltimore, which seems like heaven on earth compared to Shittsburgh."
"2","Square Pizza is a great Pittsburgh area thing that alot of people just don't understand Beto's is new to me there is Tons of Cheese and Pepperoni and great Sauce very generous with toppings a little expensive but well worth it.  If you like this pizza try Osso's in Washington PA."
"1","From reading other reviews and dining guides, it looks like this is very much a hit or miss place. Either you love pizza with toppings thrown on after cooking, or you don't. I fall into the later category: I didn't like it at all.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese pizza and a grilled chicken salad. For the pizza, the crust was salvageable after I pushed aside a good quantity of cheese (most of it). The salad was...nothing short of horrific. Overloaded with fries and (big surprise) more cheese, getting to the lettuce and other toppings took some digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below.\n\nI don't get this place."
"1","Sorry, but our pizza was cold.  All nine cuts of it.  And the garlic wings didn't taste like garlic.  Maybe it was an off night?"
"1","There are only so many ways to make the American bastardized version of a pizza, but for some reason there are as many \""pizza shops\"" as there are stars in a clear night sky. As they may be stunning to behold, from afar each one is pretty much the same thing. This shop is another place that tosses sauce and cheese on bread and serves it to their patrons. Ok, so they DO have a slightly different take, throwing the cold shredded cheese onto the pie as soon as the dough is out of the oven. This does not melt the cheese, and I do see how the pizza would be cold after heaping on the cheese.  Some customers may like it, me, not so much. I tried the Italian hoagie.  It was a good size and the meat was flavorful. But that's about it. They put oil on the sandwich, but no other dressing. I expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed. My date ordered a hot sausage hoagie. I didn't sample it, he liked it, but it was way too messy. The bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart. It looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich.  The staff did seem pretty nice, even trying to keep a smile while dealing with the stress of a busy crowded restaurant. The dining room is also a bit cramped. There are plenty of booths, but the tables are rather close together and hard to maneuver between. Hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain. When they are busy, it is a claustrophobic nightmare."
"2","This is my Man's favorite pizza place.  When he has visited Pittsburgh in the past without me, he sends me picture messages of his slices.  On the plane ride coming into Pittsburgh last week, all he could talk about was Beto's.  So, when we landed we of course drove right over (after being awake all night on a red eye flight) so that I could taste all that is awesome in Beto's pizza slices.  It was very good.  We ordered the simple extra cheese pizza.  For those of you who are like me (from Oregon where I guess NO pizza is good), this pizza was hot crust, sauce, and minimal melted cheese, with fresh cold mozzarella piled HIGH on top.  I have never had a slice of pizza put in front of me with so much cold cheese piled on it before.  I wasn't exactly sure how to eat it, but figured it out, and it was very good, different but good.  I would take Beto's pizza over Oregon pizza any day."
"1","This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here."
"1","This is the kind of pizza where the toppings are added after the crust is cooked. Cheese included. It's a novelty, and for some folks it's their favorite pizza. The taste is good, if a little weird, but for me, it didn't satisfy my pizza craving.\n\nThis location was crowded and the wait was long, but the people were nice."
"2","I absolutely LOVE betos\n\nWhen i first moved to Pittsburgh i actually hated it and refused to get the pizza, so i would just stick with the Italian Hoagie..... Yummmm it is probably the best hoagie in the burgh, no jokes.\n\nThe pizza i grew to, and i assume that some people have to do the same. But boy did i grow to it fast once i did. I remember one day just trying a slice and was in love with it. I think it has to be the sauce, it is so so so so sweet and just abosultely amazing. The cheese is also amazing because it makes the hot cold sensation just that much better. I always get 2 slices, 1 mushroom 1 plain and an italian hoagie with lettuce pickles mayo \n\nI truely cant wait to get back to the burgh to have some betos\n\nA down side to betos is it gets pricey if you eat alot. But hey if thats what good pizza costs then so be it, im happy with it"
"1","I tried the \""cold cheese and toppings\"" slice that Beto's is famous for.  If you have heard about there style of serving pizza, and are wondering what the punch line is, there isn't one.   They make a big square tomato-sauce pizza and throw cold shredded cheese and other cold toppings on it, and that's it. There's no secret ingredient or special something  that makes it tastes like anything other than what you would get it you grabbed pizza fixings from your kitchen and forgot to bake them.\n  \n I guess a lot of people like it, and more power too them. But I don't get it. Ramblin' Boy didn't get it. I see zero reason to agree with people that say that this is the \""best\"" pizza in the region. \n\n Maybe their hoagies will be better."
"1","Canned green peppers!?! Way too much cheese. The yinzers seem to like it. The average BMI in that place was probably close to 30 and no wonder; the food is incredibly unhealthy. The pizza crust tasted like Pizza Hut. Maybe this place gets good reviews because it's a unique twist on unhealthy; loads of uncooked mozzarella."
"1","Wow, just wow. That was without a doubt the worst \""pizza\"" I've ever had in my life. Maybe you would like it. Do you like all of your toppings out of a can? I didn't even know you could get canned green bell peppers. Do you like your slices of pizza to be covered with a huge several inch thick mound of uncooked mozzarella cheese? If answer is yes, then maybe this place is for you. It is definitely not for me."
"2","My first half cooked Pizza!\n\nSo I have heard about Beto's for quite some time now. From my main man, and Dormont's own Anthony Pecora (now), to my other main man, Nick Rockwell, who used to play at Dormont park and eat the pizza as a kid.\n\nMy first imprecision, \""Damn, they didn't cook my pie!\"" I have heard a lot about this pizza but know one has ever said anything about a \""Raw\"": slice of pizza! But to no avail, it was an illusion. It seems as if they cook there pizza and then top it with the toppings....? Strange..? Well, yes it is strange to this jedi, but Beto's knows what they are doing! \n\nThe crust is in word, umm, ahhh, AWESOME! Nice and crunhcy, light and flaky, and also has the moistness of a biscuit.......if that makes any sense. Sauce is also good, nothing crazy, just good ole pizza sauce. The sauce reminds me of Kiddyland Pizza at Kennywood, or it has the feel of Della Sala's Pizza (Verona). \n\nI went with my favorite pizza combination, Mushroom & Onion. I was excited because they use canned mushrooms and loaded them on. Call me weird, but i love canned mushroom on my pizza. Another delight, the onion was sliced into rings. Onions HAVE to be sliced into rings for pie....plain an simple. Diced? One pissed of jedi! Like I said before, raw toppings, so it was a shock to bite into raw cheese and onion. The raw onion went well with the whole Beto's thing they have going on. I was pleased.\n\nI will be back to Beto's and it is a great change of pace. I do not know if it is blaspheme to order the pie \""double cooked\"", but I would like to try that. It would definitely be a knife & fork pie. \n\n * JEDI APPROVED *"
"1","This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten."
"1","I don't get it. Cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza? Why does Pittsburgh have to be so weird? I just got accustomed to fries and coleslaw on my sandwiches but a guy has to draw the line somewhere. And what's with everyone bagging up their extra cheese and taking it home? \n\nMy gut tells me this would be an awesome pizza if only they'd cook it."
"2","This is a place you either love or hate   I love it!  every time I am in Pittsburgh I have to stop in and get enough so I have take home.  The pizza is sold by the square slice.  The sauce is chunky tomato based and baked with cheese. period. after it comes out of the oven it is sliced and heaped with more cheese and what ever topping you want.  I suggest just sticking to the peperoni.  The toppings are not cooked, the cheese melts a bit but not all the way and the peperoni is lukewarm at best.  My mouth is watering while I write this.  You probably will not see 3 stars on any reviews.  Give it a shot"
"2","I love this place.  Every time I am town I have to stop and pick up a couple cuts.  I even take them home with me to Baltimore.  They are great even days later.  Coming to town in a couple weeks and am I definitely taking some home to my fiance.  Cheese cheese and more cheese please.  This is my favorite pizza ever."
"1","The pizza was fine. My issue is that, if you aren't like other pizza places with your pricing, you should maybe tell me that when I call to order a medium with two toppings. We ended up with a $36 pizza that will take us days to eat, when I THOUGHT I ordered a medium with pepperoni and sausage on half. All young kids working there. No professionalism. No explaination of anything. 50 cents per slice for every topping? Well yeah we got 14 slices, so do the math. NOT a medium. Boxed up horribly, so on our 3 minute ride home, the box was leaking grease out of the corner. I was so upset over spending nearly $40 on something that I thought would be cheap and easy, I couldn't even enjoy the pizza. Its just whatever pizza anyway. \n\nSave your money and go to Slice on Broadway. 1/3 of the price,  staff is wonderful,  and they have a liquor license and fair prices. Slice should get half the publicity this place gets. \n\nNever mind that I've lived in Pittsburgh all my life and have never heard of Betos until I moved 3 streets behind it. NOT a \""Pittsburgh institution.\"""
"2","Great food and great pricing."
"1","No way. A ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza? No no no. No beer either."
"2","Been going here for years, and will continue...I agree with some of the others, you will either love it or hate it.. It's just different, but classic in its own way... Square cut pizza with cold toppings... So frigging good...just let the cheese melt....."
"1","I knew the original owner of Beto's and she would be furious for what is being done to it, now.  If the pizza slice gets any smaller, you'll have to call it a breadstick.  There was almost NO meat, on my Italian hoagie, which used to be the best around.  Whoever recently took over, should be ASHAMED.  Betos now STINKS."
"1","Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away."
"1","First off, had my boyfriend not told me that every topping on the pizza was cold (including the cheese!), I would have never known. They should really have an illuminated sign that advises the customers.\n\n I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. \n\nHad this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full.  They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings\n. \nI feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth. I would eat here again if I get the craving - some people in the restaurant had ordered other menu items that looked to be pretty good. I wouldn't take somewhere here as a Pittsburgh Destination though. \nThere is about 10 tables in the restaurant (booths/tables) ... clean/reputable."
"2","Good pizza as well as other great menu options.  Good prices too."
"1","Didn't live up to my expectations at all.  Waste of time and money.  Sloooooow service."
"1","My husband and I had this pizza for the first time last night.  He suggested it after hearing recommendations from friends.  This was the most disgusting excuse for a pizza I've ever had! We ordered pizza for pick up.  The girl told my husband 20 minutes and he picked our pizza up in a timely fashion.  The best thing about this pizza was the crust.  That was it! It was cold! It was not even warm like it had been warmed up before my husband picked up our order.  We got two extra toppings, which were just heaped in a pile on the middle of our slices.  These were cold too. And mushrooms from a can!!! Why am I paying extra for disgusting canned vegetables.  The sauce had absolutely no flavor and was completely cold. I would never go to this place ever again.  It was a lazy excuse for a pizza.  Who gives someone a COLD pizza for pick up?!?!?"
"2","I love Beto's pizza! It is not always the same though. Occasionally you get a day when it's off. It is also not for everyone. Tons of unmelted cheese, whole tomatoes, very crispy crust. If your up to try something different, Beto's is it. Their hoagies are also very good. They aren't super expensive, and I like how you can get as many cuts as you want. Sometimes I just don't want a whole pizza!"
"2","Either you get it or you dont.  \n\nThe cold cheese might sound weird, the toppings being cold might not sound good, just shut up and try it.  This pizza is unlike any you've had before but if you like pizza it is a must have.  I dont make a trip to Pittsburgh with out stopping by Betos.  The toppings are plentiful, the cheese is ridiculous and the crust is super crispy.  Love this place."
"2","Whaaaat?! Noone's reviewd Scoops? This place is the ultimate hangout. Young and old alike. The prices are average, the flavors are plentiful, and the staff is always friendly (always a plus on my list.) \n\nIt's a few blocks from my house and I remember on hot summer days grabbing my sisters, yelling upstairs to our parents \""We're going to Scoops!\""  and walking up there. We'd taste the flavors we were trying to decide over (they give you little spoons to do this!) and then we'd pick. There's also an assortment of frozen yogurt, sorbet, milkshakes, toppings, candy, and sodas, too! After paying, we'd take our cones outside and sit on the steps chatting well into dusk. \n\nMany people come here all year round. Everyone in the neighborhood knows each other and you're bound to run into someone you know.\n\nGreat place for ice cream and making memories."
"2","Sweet little shop - great place to take the kiddos, and nice to see a huge selection of hand dipped cones and it's a nice departure from the yogurt bars."
"1","I've never, EVER experienced such poor customer service before at any beer distributor.  Yes, I called them and asked for a price on ordering a case of import beer.  When they called me back with the price, I decilned purchase.  I was talking at the same time to another distributor who was doing a lot more leg work for me tracking down the supply chain.  When he informed me he could have a case shipped to wherever I bought my beer, I gave him Banksville Beer's name thinking I was giving them some extra business.  I don't normally get my beer from there.  When I stopped into Banksville to pick it up, a person who I assume was the owner got immediately defensive with me, raised his voice saying \""You told me you didn't want it.\""  I tried to explain what had happened, but he continuously interupted me with a constantly rising voice level barely allowing me to get a word in.  He claimed he did not speak to the guy I had spoken to, which was obviously a lie since he referred specifically to \""that person you (meaning me) talked to.\""  I finally had to cut him off and say, \""Listen, do you have the case here or not?\""  He said they did not, so I left.\n\nI can understand his frustration if what I did caused him any loss or inconveneince, but he did not need to take the majorly unprofessional approach that he did.  I honestly had no idea that I did anything wrong, and on the contrary thought I had actually done them a favor.  Had he explained the circumstance, it would have been no harm, no foul and lesson learned.  And I just would have asked them to order me a case straight out and would have returned for more cases to be orderd in the future.  But because of that reaction, I will NEVER step foot in there again under any circumstance.  No beer is worth dealing with a world class A-hole like that."
"2","Eat'n Park is known for their \""Smiley\"" cookie (like a chewy black-and-white sugar cookie, but white, with a smiley face drawn in icing).  My wife insisted on going to Eat'n Park on our trip to Pittsburgh.  But she hates the Smiley cookie.  What drew her was the strawberry pie.\n\nThe pie itself merits four stars.  It's inexpensive ($2.99, and a whole pie is less than $10) and bursting with fresh, huge berries.\n\nFried zucchini ($5-6) is listed as an appetizer, but is enough for a meal, and comes from a local farm in Butler.  The freshness really shows in the taste.  It's breaded with a cornmeal batter, which produced some really tragic consequences for me an hour later.  90 minutes after that, however, I no longer regretted eating the fried zucchini.  Yes, it was that good.  I wouldn't do it again, mind you, but in retrospect, it was worth it."
"1","Mediocre and poorly made! You can get better quality food from Mcdonalds don't waste your time or money"
"1","I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11:41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes.  That is outrageous to me, I've never had anything good to say about this location and will not be visiting again."
"2","We come here a LOT and are usually quite happy. The fried pickles are ridiculously good!! Decent off street parking, good selection, open 24 hours and the staff is usually great."
"1","My experience here was not good my family and I were seated all the way in the back of the Resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. We were the ONLY African Americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that, the food wasn't good it lacked lots of flavor \nI wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone keep driving"
"2","Who does not love a DQ Blizzard? And I heart the Girl Scout Thin Mint Blizzard. Next time, I will get the mini size. The small filled me up before I finished!"
"2","Peanut Buster Parfaits rule! I'm glad we have one so close. Nuff said!"
"1","This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \""I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\"" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\n\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \""Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\"" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \n\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \""I don't know\"" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask."
"2","When my favorite lamp stopped working, I went to Lighting by Erik because they were close to my home. I was initially pleased by the private parking lot as parking can be an issue in that area. The service I received was outstanding.. I was told that I could save about $30 by fixing the lamp myself, and was directed to the technicion who quickly showed me the parts and how to do the repair. I was very impressed by his expertise and customer service, and learned he has been doing this for 45 years. They really went out of their way to help me out on the spot, and it made my morning. I was also impressed by their chandelier selection and will definitely visit again to shop."
"1","I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed. If you are thinking about going here know this:\n\nIf you grew up in the South Hills, all the people from high school that turned out to be real losers will be hanging out here. (Hey, I've been there, so I am not throwing stones.)\n\nIt is otherwise your typical South Pittsburgh yinzer bar. There is always a seat, and there are free pretzels."
"2","Almost but not quite perfect. Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \""Codfather\"" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \""Codfather\"" is prepared 3 ways - \""Part 1\"" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \""Part 2\"" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \""Part 3\"" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \""express lunch\"" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings."
"2","Yum. \n\nI love when places surprise you! Brunch is my passion so I am always on the hunt for new spots. I love the Pamela's scene but sometimes you need that bloody mary to hold you off until you can dig into your home fries. \n\nBLOODY MARY BAR, O HEY! \n\nPros: breakfast and booze, huge portions ( I got a side of oatmeal and it was double a meal portion), CHEAP!!!!, Early hours \n\nCons: Parking is a bitch, slower (a huge party sat before us though) \n\nDef will be back for some day drinking"
"1","I've been to Cain's quite a few times, since I live right down the street.\n\n\nThe best times I have had at Cain's consist of myself going into the establishment with the predetermined mentality of spending way too much for drinks ( $7.00 for a Jameson and Ginger!!??) and already being three sheets to the wind. \n\nDon't get me wrong, if you like going to a place that mildly reminds me more of a mosh pit at times than an actual drinking establishment, you would love Cain's. Definitely, avoid going on the weekends.\n\nBut, I will admit that Cain's is an awesome place to post up at the bar, drink a few beers, and catch a Pen's game on one of their million TV's. \n\nBottom line : This place is not a place where you and your buds can go and get poopy drunk at. Cains is, at best, a bar where you stop during a bar crawl for a beer and a shot. \n\nNothing more, and nothing less."
"2","It was our first visit to Cains and we were very pleased. Food was very good and reasonably priced. We will be back if ever in Dormont"
"2","This was a solid stop for a lunch with my grandma and my mother.  As we drove by, my mother said, \""Oh, Cain's that place brings back memories.\""  So, I told her to pull on over because we were going in.\n\nAfter seeing the abundant sauces, I had to go with the wings.  I was very happy with them.  The sauces were plentyful and very different.  I got the mild garlic parm and the signature Mean Green, which was a mix of peppers.  Both were delicious and came with carrots, celery, and ranch free of charge!!\n\nMy mom's mushroom chicken wrap was huge and delicious, and her sweet potato waffle fries were great.  They could have been a little more crispy, but that is just how I like them.\n\nNow my grandma's sandwich was good, but it were the homemade chips that had me in love.  They were phenomenal.  Next time I night jut make a meal out of their chips."
"1","This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!\n\nI have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. \n\nSincerely,\n Matt K.\n\nHere is the response that I got\n\nPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.\nThank you for making me aware of the situation.\nJoey DeMarco \n\nI promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!"
"2","HELLO new neighborhood watering hole!  \n\nThis place is legit!  Moving to the new hood in Dormont means finding a new go to bar.  I need a my hood bar to have a good selection of beer (I accept Yuengling and hopefully a rotating seasonal list) and good bar food.  Good bar food doesn't have to be good.  I mean, it has to be good, but it doesn't have be gourmet poutine, if you know what I'm sayin'?  \n\nCain's totally surprised me because they have a mega beer list, with lots of drafts on tap, and this particular night Southern Tier Pumking was in the hizzouse!  Their menu is HUGE too!  Tons of faves like wings and burgers but the intriguing \""Codfather,\"" which I will take part in at some point!  I was in the mood for a Rachel, because well, why not... it's my name!  \n\nThe Rachel was awesome, with a good amount of turkey, but not overwhelming and lots of coleslaw, which is totally how I like it!  The rye was fresh and toasted and it all came together perfectly.  But the fries, the fries win my seal of approval!  They were crisp and seasoned correctly, which is a winning fry in my opinion.  \n\nI'll see you soon Cains, and will be working my way through your extensive draft list and food menu on the reg!"
"2","Have heard that Cain's serves a mean breakfast.   Sure enough, they do!\nA large menu to select from and a Bloody Mary bar.  \nMany big groups and families chowing down.  \nIt was crowded but when we walked in there was an empty table.  \nService was pretty good.  It did take a little while for the food to come out but the place as packed and we were not in any hurry.  \nMy fritata was good and the home fries were good too.\nJust get there before noon, if you want breakfast."
"2","Great beer on tap selection.  Stopped there for lunch recently and had a salad that will bring me back there again soon.  Many, many TVs in the bar area, so this would be a great place to watch a sporting event."
"2","Went here because the Chinese restaurant a couple of doors down from Cain's that we were going to was closed. The noise in this place is over the top, so much so that we couldn't have a conversation. We were hungry so we stayed and I'm glad. I got the \""Cod father 2\"" with a side of onion rings. This comes served with french fries and coleslaw and hot sauce served on top. I asked if all the stuff be served on the side because I'm picky about coleslaw. This is a great sandwich, even deconstructed. The cole slaw is creamy without being soggy and the fries are fresh.The onion rings were stellar. My companion got a rubin and she said that it was pretty good.I was too full, but she got a brownie with ice cream and she was very pleased."
"1","This place is just average. The service is subpar at best and the waitresses always seem rushed. However, their wings and wing flavors are good, and they have so many tv's there isn't a bad seat in the house if you're there for a game. Now that the parking lot across the street is gone, good luck looking for a spot. I would go back, but only for the wings and the spicy cheese bites."
"2","Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time."
"2","I just moved in the neighborhood and don't have my laundry room set up yet. I went here to wash my bed sheets and it was a pretty typical laundromat. The woman working was very friendly and helpful (telling me the best machines to use for what I was doing)"
"2","Pretty good laundromat, though not without it's...quirks.\n\nSince my apartment doesn't have a laundry room, this is the closest laundromat for me to wash my clothes.  \n\nWhat I like about this place is that it's bright, pretty clean, and the attendant is very friendly.  If you go at a good time (weekday evening or early morning on weekends) it's also pretty empty -- which I like.  They also have a little sitting area to hang out in, rather than having to lean against your washing machine.\n\nThe downside is that it's more expensive than other laundromats I've been to, and the dryers are pretty tricky (some take forever to dry your clothes, some run too hot, sometimes make your clothes smell like gas... not sure about that last one) so that part is a bit of a guessing game.\n\nOverall, the positives outweigh the negatives.  Any laundromat you go to is going to have some inconveniences, but this is by far one of the nicer ones I've used."
"2","I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \""with it.\"" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!"
"2","The banana oatmeal pancakes were really special."
"2","Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here"
"2","OMG!  Hands down the best pancakes I have ever put in my mouth. Sometimes I day dream about Dor Stop pancakes.  Too bad I live 6 hours away or I'd go there everyday.  \n\nThe service was just ok, but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait."
"2","The Dor-Stop is my new favorite place to have breakfast, narrowly beating out my own kitchen table. I love the eggs, the home fries, and the friendly but harried service. The Dor-Stop is almost always packed with customers, and for good reason. \n\nOne small quibble: please, for the love of all that is holy, get rid of the fake-o Mrs. Butterworths and put out some real maple syrup for those tasty pancakes. Really, Dor-Stop, you're worth it. I believe in you."
"1","Been here twice. Hate to say it but nothing special. The usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation."
"2","After remembering seeing the Dor-Stop on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, we stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning at around 10AM.  Beating the brunch rush was great.  We had a short wait but were seated quickly.  Service was friendly, if a bit rushed.  My omelette was tasty, as were the accompanying home fries.  Everything was fresh and well-prepared.  I would return, and it's the kind of local joint I'll look forward to bringing out-of-town guests to."
"2","My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!"
"2","The Dor-Stop restaurant has an enchanting, old fashioned look inside and out that effectively conveys its main appeal: good simple cooking at reasonable prices. The menu has typical diner favorites. I ordered the ham off the bone breakfast (with their special ham, potato pancakes, eggs, and toast) and true to form, it was very good (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7.   \n\nI went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full, so I didn't have to wait. Food came quickly and service was good (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as \""honey\"" every time).  As I was finishing up, an older gentleman, seemingly a \""regular,\"" came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff. He took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him. (He ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup.) And he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch. I'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great place this is and keep coming back."
"2","Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.\n\nThe place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.\n\nNow lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.\n\nI got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.\n\nMy girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.\n\nOh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world."
"2","Ahhh Dor-Stop. A nice little brunch spot. I ordered the egg combo this time around. The eggs were average, and the bacon was pretty skimpy, but the pancakes. Ohhhhhhh the pancakes! If it wasn't for these scrumptious staples of breakfast I would never know why it was worth waiting 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes. These this are filling! I could only eat 1 1/2 before being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkey. Mmmm stuff a turkey with pumpkin pancake .............. anyway. I usually need syrup to add flavor to this sweet treat, but I didn't need any here! I also tried Darren's chocolate chip pancakes. The had so many semisweet chips in them I thought they were stuffed pancakes at first! Soooooo good but even one round cake would make me feel a bit sick from sugar overload. The staff seems able to keep up with the tidal wave of a crowd and get everyone in and out rather quickly. I like that! If you're looking for a place to relax and take your time, this ain't it. if you want some quality pancakes or French toast (poor man's egg sandwich as the Britts call it) and a show watching the cooks do their thang, come here and and be amazed!"
"1","Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype."
"2","This place has some seriously good breakfast.  They have many good things.  The pancakes looked awesome and I would get them next.  I had the Guy's version of the jumbot and it was delicious.  The cinnamon rolls are great too!  \nIt is a busy place for good reason."
"2","For my group of friends, this is the ultimate post-5K run reward!\n\nHere are the rules (they are my rules, but you should adopt them for Dor-Stop success):\n1. Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating)\n2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait, consider yourself the luckiest person alive.\n3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name, so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special, don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too).\n4. Order specialty pancakes \""for the table\"" (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick, yet so fluffy at the same time!\n\nThe surprising news: they take credit cards (it gives off a \""cash only\"" vibe).\n\nThe opportunity area: syrup that does not come in an old-fashioned squeeze bottle!  It takes me about 15 minutes to get the disgusting amount of syrup I want atop my fluffy pancakes."
"2","Another 5-star find in the Pittsburgh area. I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually, I don't know that for sure, but I dare you to find a better diner anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe food here is made with love and that's what makes it stand out out. You can taste the love in every single bite.  The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat day.\n\nI had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. It was more than enough for Jim and I to share.  We also shared the fantastic pumpkin pancakes. They do not need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious and gut-busting.  Why do I have to live in D.C?  I would be here every weekend for brunch.  There is nothing like this place over here..wahhh!   This place is great for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family style. The portions are gigantic and unforgiving! \n\nAnyway, do not come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  of their appearance on the Food Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no nonsense  service and absolutely amazing food.  If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat at Dor-Stop.  This is a glutton's dream come true."
"1","Guy's Jumbot Plate O'Crap - Made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the Dor-Stop.We both made the same order Guy's Jumbot. When the order arrived mine was over cooked , the egg portion resembled the dry pressed paper used in the egg carton. My serving was served without cheese. My son's was fine. When I went to pay and said something I got a vacant stare and I am so sorry. I ended up with a take out for my dog to eat. teh toast was perfect though. I started makeing this hour long trek with family members about a year ago. We would come out about every 4-6 weeks. The last two trips the quality has started to slip a little...but never to this extent that it really mattered.Save yourself the effort ....This is not a Diner, this is not a drive-in...this does not even rank high enough to be a Dive. Denny's would be a better choice."
"2","The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  \n\nThe Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.\n\nMy coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?\n\nBreakfast Breakdown,\n\nThe Food: Delicious!\nThe Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.\nThe Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!\nWould I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.\n5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!\n\nBonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review? Points to the winner!"
"1","While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street, I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about. The food was only fair and they don't even have real cream for your coffee. It's that nasty fake nondairy crap. It also gave me the heebeegeebees due to the \""Christianesgue\"" motif."
"2","We used to live right around the corner from this delicious Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives spot, and I'm so sad to now live 30 minutes away. The pancakes are definitely the best item at this dive - the chocolate chip and pumpkin are to die for! Service is also pretty quick for a location that has such a cramped dining room and tiny kitchen space. Plan to wait a bit (maybe 30 minutes or so) for a table on Saturday mornings!"
"2","I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.\n\nIrregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.\n\nThe pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).\n\nLori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.\n\nThe jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \""ham off the bone\"".\n\nOne other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.\n\nIf you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve)."
"2","Didn't even know this was a DDD place. We just searched Yelp for something decent in Pittsburgh. The Dor-Stop did not disappoint. The stuffed raspberry French toast was insane. The waitress warned me it was really sweet, but I felt that it was perfectly balanced.\n\nDefinitely check this place out, and don't be freaked out at the potential of long waits. We waited 20 mins at 10 am on a Saturday. You'll be fine."
"2","I recently walked to the Dor-Stop from my new place in Dormont. I've heard good things, including (of course) that they were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.\n\nIt was a weekday at around 11am, and the place was still packed. I sat at the counter after a brief wait, because it was the only available seat in the house. The gentleman next to me, as it turns out, is related to the restaurant owner. He gets a five-star review, but I swear I'm not even taking that into account with my official five-star Yelp rating.\n\nThe wait staff was very busy, but also attentive. Great mix of friendly and efficient. I couldn't decide what to order - everything sounded amazing. I ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever tasted. A little crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I used ZERO syrup. I prefer my bacon a little crispier, but it was still good.\n\nI'll be back to sample a more lunch-y entree. In the mean time, though, five stars for sure!"
"2","You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! \n\nWhile Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!\n\nI split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!\n\nThe only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! \n\nI think there's some other stuff on the menu, but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes!"
"2","AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.\n\nWe went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!\n\nOnce I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it, really really good.  There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.\n\nI would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good."
"2","Fantastic. Best hotcakes around and I've never had a bad meal here.  The staff is friendly and personable."
"2","Wow!!  My wife and I had breakfast at the Dor-Stop this morning and it was outstanding!!  We had about a 20 minute wait to get in but it was worth it.  The service was fast and the food was great.  We will surely return......"
"2","Stopped by this place as we were in Pittsburgh for the day. We went in for brunch and there was a long line of people waiting. We were told that the wait would be 20 minutes, so we put our names down and stepped outside to kill some time. When we came back 20 mins. later we were told that they had called our names 5 mins. ago but the hostess was nice enough to tell me that she would seat us next. \n\nI ordered the oatmeal walnut pancakes with a side of sausages. The pancakes were really good and I was pleasantly surprised since I didn't know what to expect.\n\nThe only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is that when we were done eating and ready to pay our waitress all of sudden brought me a pancake and said there was a shortage of pancakes so she was sorry. I thought it was a bit deceptive on her end for not mentioning this to me earlier when she served us our food.\n\nBecause when we received our food I thought it was strange that I only received two stacks of pancakes, but didn't question it thinking that since it was a \""specialty pancake\"" I was suppose to only get two. It couldve been an honest mistake, but I still felt that she should have mention this to me earlier."
"2","I stopped by for lunch and had the steak salad.  It was pretty yummy but the steak had too much fat on it. The reason why I am giving it only 4 stars is because my steak was not done the way I requested and our waitress had zero personality.  I recommend going here for breakfast and not for lunch."
"2","LOVE this place!!  Awesome pancakes.  Awesome food."
"2","I am always up for trying out one of those places featured on food network. The wait to get into this place was long and goes out the door. Its a very small restaurant with about 15 tables at best. Its one of the divey places where the staff clearly knows what they're doing and does it right. when we finally did sit and order service was fast. I had a meat omelet with hashbrowns. Im not much of a breakfast person so I wasnt overly impressed with it. Large portions though. I would come back here to try more of the menu."
"2","I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's, I just couldn't see this place making me happy when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot cakes, SUPERB hash browns, and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!\n\nI prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat, and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - true lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm insides, and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.\n\nDespite the long wait and weird waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!"
"1","Folks this is very overrated.. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back.. Very small and uncomfortable. They have a large sign in window to play on Guy's visit a number of years ago. Dont fall for it."
"1","For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever."
"1","I really, really wanted to try Dor - Stop, but it wasn't open when I went! My wife and I woke up early just to go there, and the diner was closed for the next few days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such a waste of time. If you're going to go, make sure you call ahead, just so you don't get screwed over like we did."
"1","Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.\n\nWe came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \n\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\n\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \""Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\"" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \n\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\n\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience."
"2","great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast, and the bob's special. french toast was crisp and cooked perfectly, although not really stuffed, just an extra slather of raspberry jam. Bob's special was very tasty, German potato pancakes were a little under cooked but great tasting.  Service was quick and brisk, waited about 25 minutes on a Sunday morning, which was not bad but it was raining this day."
"2","I stopped in here after seeing the place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I had a late breakfast with my boss, as we were both in town from Miami to do some research for the travel section in the magazine I edit.\nUnfortunately, this was the first DDD meal that didn't leave me wanting more. The marquee dish on the show was the Jumbot. I had it and it didn't do very much for me. That said, it wasn't bad either.\nOn the bright side, my boss said that Dor-Stop's was one of the best eggs benedicts he'd ever had. He's very critical of restaurants, so I take that praise pretty seriously.\nService was as friendly and informal as yo"
"2","They have one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I have never had anything bad here. Great meat products, just don't get the sausage patties. They are not of high quality, but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good, but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed, it is always packed, and there is always a wait."
"2","A little biased since I live so close, but I love the Dor-Stop. Great, typical, greasy spoon diner. Always give the special a shot."
"1","Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes.  Everybody told me I HAD to try and their pancakes.\nWell, the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes."
"2","Great Breakfasts!  Worth the wait to get a table since Diners,Drive ins and Dives had been there. Pancakes are very fluffy and waffles too!"
"2","Great little local diner!! Must go if your in town.  Food was amazing and all made from scratch!!  Had the Pumkin Stuffed French Toast today!! Perfect size portions. Wait staff super friendly. Gets crowded, but never a long wait. Highly recommend."
"1","We were in Pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on Don Campiti's Pizza. Urban Spoon rated 91% favorite. This pizza is not good. Honestly, it tastes like Geno's frozen pizza from the grocery store. The pepperoni was very good. The crust was super thin and tasted like a salteen cracker. I've had much better pizza and will be exploring other options next time I'm in the burg."
"2","I First Met Don in 1973 when I ordered my first Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza.\n\nDon use to work the counter himself and was always a very customer service kinda guy.\n\nI really miss him , but I'll never miss this Pizza cause I'll ALWAYS be a customer.\n\nAs far as rateing , this place will be on my TOP 5 till I die."
"2","Great pie...I could eat a whole large though...if you like a thin crust, you will love this"
"1","People really are nuts about their pizza in the 'burgh - this I'm learning. \n\nI ordered a pizza from here because it's in my hood (walking distance, even) and because someone told me it's been their favorite pizza since they were wee little. I think a lot of places in Pit have false-yum status because people are just emotionally attached to things they've eaten for so many years... I don't fault them for that, but this just isn't great pizza, in my opinion."
"1","The Hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment.  We moved in to the neighborhood, and all we heard was Campiti's this Campiti's that, and how it is without a doubt, the best pizza in the Burgh.\n\nSo, of course we tried it, and were pretty excited to do so. Now I have lived in several different Pittsburgh neighborhoods, and you always find the pizza you like where you live. Campiti's pizza is not the pizza I like. I wouldn't order a pizza from them again.\n\nHonestly, it was about up to a frozen pizza standard. Now, I'm not saying they are making frozen pizzas, they aren't but, I have even had better frozen pizzas than the pizza we got from Campiti's.\n\nAnother reviewer hit the nail on the head saying people who say this is the best pizza around probably have some long running emotional attachment to this place That can be he only logical reason that people actually say it.\n\n."
"1","Disappointed after hearing so many good things. Pizza crust is like a cracker. Hoagie is pretty good, but does not remove the disappointment over the pizza. I think Molly's Pizza next door is a lot better....I won't order from here again."
"1","Compared to the original Don Campiti Pizza of the 60's and 70's this is not even close. The legacy of a superior pizza in Dormont has lost it. No longer up there with Beto's and area best. Sad to say this pizza was so bad. I have been a diehard customer of the 60's and 70's. Crust was like cardboard. Toppings were worse. What happened to the legacy Don Campitis Pizza ?"
"1","When my car died, I originally had it towed to Ruffing because it was close to where my car broke down.  After I saw the good reviews, I figured it'd be worth a shot, and was surprised at how awful the people were.\n\nRuffing originally suggested I take my car to a dealer, since it's an uncommon model and they didn't know what the problem was.  I asked if I could just pay for a vehicle diagnostic, since they're more likely to be honest than a dealership. They said it would take around a day-and-a-half to get to it.\n\nAlmost three days later, I hadn't heard back from them.  Since I need my car on a daily basis, it was frustrating that they were well past their quoted time with no updates as to what was going on.  The repairs are what should take time - not a diagnostic.\n\nMy biggest issue was the attitude I received when I called.  When I called to see why there was a delay, the mechanic became agitated.  His tone became condescending when he told me it's my fault for leaving the car with him -- that I just HAD to have him look at it and I was SO against going elsewhere.  He said he had cars sitting there for weeks that he hasn't even touched yet (?) so he can't bother with mine. Ultimately I had to get my car towed to a dealership anyway, since I couldn't afford to have my car sit at their shop for \""weeks\"".\n\nI wished they were more up front with how back logged they were, rather than trying to give me a schedule they couldn't abide by, and then take their stress out on me when I followed up with them.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this mechanic to anyone.  You're better off going somewhere that has realistic wait-times and up front communication.  And you definitely don't want to deal with a mechanic who is going to lose his cool with you at the drop of a hat."
"1","You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair, I've had my fair share of terrible haircuts. The one I had at this salon was among the worst. I explained to the owner of the salon how I wanted my layering, but apparently because I didn't tell him exactly how to cut my hair - since after all, I figured he's the one who should know how to cut hair, including curly hair - it's my fault that I received such a terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair (exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do with curly hair). The owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair. And he's overpriced to boot. The other stylists may give better cuts, but the owner's attitude (\""It's not my fault\"") suggests this salon deserves no one's business."
"2","My husband and I have been coming here for the past six years and cannot say enough about the salon.  Prior to finding Geno Como, I could never get the correct looking highlights/lowlights until I found Lisa here (I'm 44!).  My hair has never looked so beautiful and I am so glad that we found such a great place.  Everyone is so friendly and I love coming here as the salon has a light and airy look to it which is very relaxing, yet the prices are very reasonable.  I have recommended more people to this salon and they are also very happy.  You cannot go wrong with Geno Como!!!"
"1","Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. \n\nProceed with caution.."
"1","My mistake that I went to Namaste India with my cousin. \nPappad were served in the beginning and that was the only moment we could afford a smile! Rest was a complete disaster..\n\nWe ordered aloo tikki and \""much recommended\"" samosa Chaat!!  Samosa chaat was cold to touch- looked like a heap of poorly cooked samosa.. worse was the RED CHILLI powder used as garnishing ( we asked it to be a bit spicy- our fault) ..that too in plenty... we could have used that amount of red chiili powder for cooking food for some 6-7 people!! Taste was below average...\n\nwe could barely think of ordering main course after the initial encounter.. Malai kofta is what we ordered besides daal... Malai Kofta looked like stuffed with samosa!! ( Pun intended) ... bland and tasteless.. NAAN were good ..thin , baked properly...out only consolation... No wonder we left half of the  ordered dishes...\n\nWorth mentioning is the fact that..Kohli's store is adjacent and we saw some samosas there..I wonder if the ones we had at namaste were part of the same deal? \n\nPlease beware of this place- you may end up cursing yourself for your visit later on... as we are doing right now..."
"1","I am not impressed.  The food was so-so and my boyfriend and I had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. I bought it that morning, sorry if it should have been taken off the website but you should honor it. I would not pay their full price for it, but with a nice coupon then maybe it could be worth it. The quality of the food was not good enough to outweigh the service."
"1","Mediocre  Food  Service and Atmosphere.\nBetter to stay clear and save your money.  \nJudging from the empty tables the luster and joy of the Namaste we remembered is no longer.\n\nWe experienced the following sub par  dishes while dining after 8 pm on a Friday evening in an empty restaurant:\n\nBland reheated Samosas.\nFlavorless Malek Paneer. ( the cheese pcs were quite good despite)  inconsistent  and barely there flavors of certainly fresh frozen spinach mix. \nBarely reheated Naan. \n\nWe traveled to eat at Namaste specifically based on delightful past experience. Obviously that feeling is long gone.  The staff  were content to chat with friends and answer frequent texts and cell phone calls while we ate. \n\nThe loud thump of bass from modern indian music with the  electric din of the TV playing Bollywood extracts might have been a nice distraction in a busy restaurant.  Instead  when added to the ding of texts and cell phone calls the loud background noises detracted rather than added  anything to an already mediocre dining experience."
"2","My wife and I have been eating here for many years now. We almost always go for the lunch buffet and have eaten here at least 25-30 times now. The menu items change every time we're here so sometimes we like it better than others and range from really thrilled by the food to feeling it's ok but are never disappointed. The owners/staff are really very nice too and they serve you fresh naan to order. I am writing now after all these years because another Indian restaurant opened a stones throw away and I want to make sure you try Namaste instead. The service and attitude at the other are just this side of rude and indifferent. Yesterday, I had baigan bharta, chana masala, palak paneer, pakora, chicken tandoor, onion naan and masala tea and all were very very good.  I skipped the chicken curry, carrots/peas, rice and tomato soup but thought I would list them to give you an idea of what else they had yesterday.  All for $7.95. I hope you'll stop by and give it a try."
"2","Loved the food! The food has a home made feel to it! \n\nYes, the old lady seemed rude. but we did not deal with her.  The cook (guy in apron) was very friendly and kept coming back to us to see if we need anything."
"2","I really liked this food. I'm not Indian, but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! \n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken 65, lamb biryani, Lamb vindaloo, and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough, but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. \n\nErythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? \n\nService was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... \n\nI would return. \n\nPortions were small, but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although, prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless."
"2","Just to let everyone know, Namaste Indian Restaurant has moved (January 2013) from it's old location in the Banksville Plaza to 1150 Banksville Rd, adjacent to The Days Inn. I've notified Yelp."
"1","I was very excited to try this place since the closure of Maharaja left us without a good Indian buffet on the side of Pittsburgh where I live, and I wasn't crazy about the restaurant that moved in afterward.  The place was relatively deserted on a Saturday afternoon and we were soon greeted by a woman who asked us what kind of naan we wanted (onion or plain).  The food tasted fairly good but what really turned us off was the woman who worked there and her constant coughing, hacking and wheezing without even covering her mouth!  Clearly she had a nasty cold and should've stayed home that day!  I cringed every time she went back into the kitchen (we could here her back there hacking up a lung) or came over to our table.  It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.  Ick, I'm cringing right now thinking of it.  On the plus side though, it did keep me from overeating.  Maybe I should have my husband cough and hack at me whenever we go to buffets from now on!\n\nAnyway, I hate to trash a restaurant but I had to voice my concerns.  I am very conflicted about giving the second star, but the food itself wasn't bad.  Try at your own risk!"
"1","This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while . I'm not sure what was worse food or service . Never again , the coupon we bought and weren't allowed to use left on the table"
"1","I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \""thank you\"" and \""how are you\"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners."
"1","I wish I could give this place \""-5\"" stars for its terrible food quality. Oily, greasy and bad taste. All 4 members of our party fell sick, throwing up and/or with a running stomach."
"1","Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-\n\nI and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party, just one hour before lunch, told that they did not get the \""PANEER/cheese\"". They can substitute it for \""MALAI KOFTA\"". It was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / \""PANEER\"" entree. On the other hand the \""MALAI KOFTA\"" was just \""POTATO\"" in the gravy. The quality of food in this party was awfully bad. \n\nThis is a humble request to all INDIAN Americans and all NON-INDIAN Americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. We are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. You can confirm these details with me anytime, I am engineer by profession. I was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but I am lucky to get an experience before hand. I will NEVER NEVER recommend this place EVER."
"1","Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low, but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm, the food was obviously left over from lunch, the rice was so old it was crunchy, all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues."
"1","I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But, I got adjusted to that in a few moments. I found only 4 or 5 items in the buffet. None of them looked fresh. I tried this place only because of the other yelp reviews. I would never go there again."
"2","The hotel has a little listing for Maharaja which includes some pretty specific and weird hours, none of which include Mondays. I called on a Monday to confirm and got a dude saying they close 9ish. I showed up and they have a menu that states pretty simply, 11am - 10pm 7 days a week.. Buffet closes at 9:30.\n\nThey didn't speak about, point to or even half heartedly gesture to the menu. I was immediately pointed to the buffet and told \""have whatever you want\"" or something similar. There were 6 veg options,  4 meats (biryanis and curries), nan, poori and bhajis, kheer and pleasantly hot gulab jamun, average (free, unlimited) lassi, some good chai,  and decent chutneys and lemon pickles.\n\nMeals ends with mukhwa, but the candy and plain fennel seeds are kept in seperate bowls. The emphasis on customer self-reliance here could be construed as bad or lazy service, but I appreciate the lax environment."
"1","Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd, and we tried it one day for lunch. Not really understanding the positive reviews here, but to each his/her own. I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street."
"1","Terrible place to eat and not very clean at all. Way over priced foe fast food. 5$ for a plain roast beef forget that!"
"1","I'm not about reviewing fast food places, but I found out this Arby's was the first in Pittsburgh. It even has the HUGE cowboy hat out front as a marker. \n\nIt has all the stuff you'd expect, Roast Beef sandwiches, and those amazing Jamocha Shakes Arby's is known for."
"1","I actually don't mind the Arby's chain; I certainly don't go to one on a regular basis, but when I do I usually enjoy the treat that is a nice giant sandwich and a side of curly fries. Usually what I get from an Arby's is an a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, while greasy, is still very tasty and doesn't leave me feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nThat said, I never enjoy the food I pick up from this particular Arby's. Firstly, often when I've placed an order in their drive-thru I've found that I've had to sit and wait for my \""fast food\"" for 10 to 15 minutes. After waiting for my food - on the days that I didn't leave the line in frustration before placing an order at all because I couldn't even do so in a reasonable amount of time - I've found that what I've gotten has been mediocre compared to what I've experienced at other Arby's. Common issues I've come across include the lack of sauces when I've asked for them, overcooked food, and so much grease that the sandwich begins coming apart AND after eating I begin to feel sick to my stomach.\n \nSorry, guys. I may not expect a lot from a fast food joint, but this Arby's just doesn't impress me."
"1","This is a very typical neighborhood Foodland.  It looks like it hasn't been renovated since the days of the Steelers \""Immaculate Reception\"", but it kind of has a certain well-worn charm.  The place is crowded and cramped too, but not unpleasant.  The parking lot is very small, but as I was taking the \""T\"", it wasn't an issue.   I stopped here last night because I was in the neighborhood attending a meeting at someone's house close by and I volunteered to pick up a treat. \n\nI'd say that this place is worth it for your run-of-the-mill staples and nothing else."
"1","It's an IGA now."
"1","Sadly really went downhill. They switched to a new vendor, the prices went up and they are no longer having sales."
"2","One of my favorite hometown pizza places. Try the white pizza, you won't be disappointed. Great place to grab a beer on Beverly road and catch up with old friends."
"2","I live in walking distance so I have been here many times . The place is very clean and the menu has many choices ... Not just pizza and hoagies . The bar is well stocked and has many varieties of beer . I would suggest coming here for breakfast or brunch on the weekends . The omlettes are huge . The only drawback is the place very small and can get crowded . You can't have a discussion without hearing what the people sitting at the next table are talking about as well . There is sometimes a wait to get a table . Good place to take the family , a date or just yourself . This place is alot like Vincents of  Green Tree."
"1","Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. \n\nMy sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. \n\nI guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  \n\nPro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection\nCon: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, not many healthy options, no dinner entrees besides pasta,"
"2","I really enjoy going to Bado's. We mostly order the Gourmet Bianco Pizza, 4 slice for the two of us, with an appetizer and that is more than enough! We draws us there is the pizza and beer. The pizza is always amazing, and they have a great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. If you want to taste a beer on tap, just ask and they will bring you a little to try. The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat.\nThe one drawback for me is how it's a bit \""too\"" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud, parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed. I frequent this restaurant, and this seems to be he case most weekday evenings and weekends."
"1","Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places."
"1","I went with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers to this joint for lunch last week. As the rating suggests - meh.\n\nIt wasn't terrible and the service was fine. I just feel like I've had much better pizza elsewhere around town. And for sure a better margherita. Theirs fell into the category that I find most end up in: a regular cheese pizza. Quite a few places seem to not understand the differences between the two, and this place was no different.\n\nNow, the cheese/margherita pizza they served me was pretty good, but it didn't stand out for me. The other two ordered sandwiches of some sort that they both really seemed to like. The beer selection was also a bit lacking for my taste, but that may just be because they didn't have anything I liked so I stuck with water (that's me when I go out to eat: alcohol or water ;)."
"2","I have been a patron of Bado's several times now, and this is a great spot to have few beers, watch a game, and meet up with friends.  Their beer selection is commendable and is frequently updated.  I have sat a the bar and had a table.  I've never had a problem with service.  Staff is knowledgeable and makes great suggestions.  \nNow for the food...their pizza is so yummy!  I love everything about it. The cheese, sauce, toppings...all great.  Their wings are also good.  \nIt can get quite packed during a game or on a weekend evening, so there can be a wait.  Grab a beer and wait b/c it's worth it."
"1","pricey, pricey pricey and it isnt that good!"
"1","I just want to like it due to its location and great beer selection, but the food is awful."
"2","Love Bado's. Any pizza is really good and their rueben is very tasty. Lots of beer choices and they give out free samples."
"1","one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. \n\ni would never eat here again"
"2","I stopped by Bado's on a recent Wednesday for an early dinner with a friend. When I first walked in, I was rather surprised at the decor. The way Bado's is talked about and with this prime location, I imagined it to be more modern. I was wrong. Inside, it is your typical neighborhood pizza place/bar. Clean, well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu, I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous, we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup, a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise, I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out, the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust. Overall, good food for a neighborhood bar."
"1","We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude, unfriendly, just a miserable male server. Drinks were lousy , service was lousy, food just o.k., nothing to write home about, and at 9:00 on a Friday night they were putting chairs on the tables and vacuuming, hinting it was time for us to leave. The whole experince was horrible... and the bill was outrageous.  Save your money and Go somewhere else!!!!"
"2","The service is a little off and the staff doesn't seem very attentive to your needs. However the food is worth having bad service. They have a great selection of pizzas but my personal favorite is the buffalo chicken."
"2","Delicious pizza. Amazing beer selection. We don't live anywhere close to this place, and will drive 45+ minutes for their food and ambience. Whenever I have family visiting, and we have the time, we trek over for a delicious dinner at Bado's. Be sure to check out their chalkboard with the drink and food specials!\n\nWe've never had any problems with the service or the food, and will definitely be back!"
"1","I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had.\n\n I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese. \n\nWhile my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight. \n\nI will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable."
"2","I always get burgers and beer here even though they're known for their pizza. No regrets! Love their growlers too!"
"1","I will never go back. Besides the gnocchi coming from a vacuum sealed bag, they offer a \"" Pittsburgh Sandwich \"" they don't know how to make. Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks, or e on a customer.  Same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment, waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change, finally got them change, as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip inside.So unprofessional. Food from a box and under trained staff. Not if they begged would I go back."
"2","An impromptu party/picnic in the yard.   Lots of kids and friends stopped by to see an old neighbor that was in town visiting.  All of a sudden, it was time to eat.  Little Nipper's to the rescue.   Ordered a few different style pizza's and some wings.  Nice crust not thin but not to thick, the sauce is tasty, cheese was nice... gummy, stringy, good.  The pizza's disappeared fast.  The wings were good and a little crunchy, just right."
"2","best pizza on beverly rd"
"1","Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too."
"1","Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. \n\nThey have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables, the \""vegetable calzone.\"" \n\nThey ended up delivering a \""Mediterranean calzone,\"" which was also vegetarian, but it wasn't what I ordered. The small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh, so I give them another half star for this. I didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.\n\nThey told me it would be about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. I give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. \n\nThis place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese, but it's not a vegan delight!"
"1","I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all."
"1","I used to live in the area and would always patronize and recommend this business.  However with the last experience I will have to rethink that. My aunt and uncle ordered a gift basket for my grandmother for her birthday. When it was delivered it looked beautiful.  However once opened not so much.  Inside it was filled with....Dollar General brand goods. When I stopped down to tell them the owner and another worker told me what do you expect. If it was a busy season we would have gotten stuff from the strip. So moral of the tale. If you want to pay a whole lot of money for stuff from the Dollar Store you know where to go. To make it even more special the owner will provide a blank stare and a warm welcoming attitude that clearly shows she does not care."
"1","I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner, not even a worker.  I was yelled at, mocked, and generally treated like crap for checking up on a remounting job that was supposed to be done within a week.  Emotional mess the rest of the day.  I have never been treated that way with any owner of a business.   I work with restaurant owners for god's sake!   Unbelievable.   If you want the full story, email me and I will tell you the whole thing.  As it is right now, DO NOT patronize this business.   There was absolutely no excuse for his attitude."
"2","I had to wait half an hour to get my hair cut.  Yes I was a walk-in, but I never wait this long to get my hair cut.  I was bit apprehensive about this experience since it is so difficult to go to a new place and the barber/stylist not know what you want.  Kimmie was awesome though, she KNOWS how to cut a guys hair.  I was surprised to find that she was using Barber Clippers rather than the Stylist Clippers with guards that are used in Florida.  I could have gotten a Five-Aught had I wanted to go that short -- TOO COLD!  \n\nKimmie worked wonders and moved rather quickly.  I was very happy with the hair cut she gave me for two very big reasons:\n1. She could do a true military high taper without having to be coached.\n2. She actually listened to what I wanted and didn't impose her own thoughts on the situation.\n\nYES!  HOME RUN!  I will return!  And no, I did not have an appointment.  I just showed up 30 minutes before they closed. \n\nCAUTION: This store is located in an odd strip plaza.  Don't park in the one way parking area or you will get stuck in traffic.  Park in the area between the PNC and the Bruesters.  You may have to walk an extra 5 feet, but you will cut 30 minutes out of your wait time."
"1","I guess that I sport a very simple haircut and like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the person who cut my hair here must have slipped with the razor just behind my ear and tried to make it look normal by cleaning it up and making the other side look the same. Since I don't typically look at myself for extended periods of time, I actually didn't notice until last night when I was washing my hands in a resteraunt bathroom.  I will be speaking with manager come Monday. \n\nI had no wait and the lady who can't cut my simple hair do was very nice, until she didn't say oops I sort of f*'d your hair up. It isn't really bad and I'm not horribly upset but it IS noticeable! It would have been nice if she said something to me about it. I think this warrants a refund of my money. I will let you all know if I got my money back."
"2","Don't buy those old pre-made arrangements from the grocery store or the overpriced stingy bunch of flowers from other places.  Come here- the service is great and the price is very reasonable.  \n\nWithout realizing it, we walked in 5 minutes before closing time.  Regardless, the owner greeted us warmly and said she would be happy to help us.  I told her I didn't know anything about flowers, so she asked for a price range and the proceeded to select and arrange a fresh bouquet.  Even though it was the end of the day, the flowers were still perky and the arrangement was spectacular.  Couldn't have been happier and will recommend it to everyone I know."
"1","An abomination....the billing department is run by a level of incompetence of which the likes have never been seen.  Ever get a bill 2 yrs late, then pay over the phone with a credit card, only to have the payment never recorded and then receive harassing phone calls?  Well I just did...."
"1","Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general."
"1","If I could leave ADT Security a negative review I would.  This is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned.  I work for a General Contractor on the West Coast and we use ADT for our clients.  Security patrol is standard, but the problem is that their invoices are obscure to the point of insensible, referencing 3 other invoices that were never received.  The only way that you can view the invoices is to login to their website with a password no one has, from a letter that is only mailed out the jobsite.  I AM NOT AT THE JOBSITE WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE, I am in the business office where we pay bills.  Their CSRs put you on hold for 10-15 minutes at a time only to tell you lies about what they can do, then you have to call back and deal with them all over again when the lies are uncovered.  They are the worst company, do yourself a favor and stay away from them."
"1","The service is not that amazing, it's almost as if they don't care to have a business. I've dealt with them for large orders and while meeting the deadlines they request, it's never enough. They usually don't have your requested kegs and will tell you to order earlier (which by experience still does not help). \n\nThe saving grace is likely for individual sales. From the times I've had go to the store to pick up our \""deliveries\"" (ie. nearly every time), it looked like they had a decent selection from the wall for cases...but who knows if they actually carry the selection."
"2","Come here instead of D's if you need to buy cases of beer. They're cheaper than D's and everything is easy to find. Thanks to the peeps at D's for the referral."
"2","This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said, however, I was really excited by the beer selection and the neon green relish. If you're looking for a chill meal, this is a great place to check out!"
"2","This is a great place to go if you're in the 'burgh. This small joint expanded in the last year. great dogs and a huge selection of beer, imported and otherwise. Service has always been decent and better. Sports agames are often on the TV so get ready for that. Atmosphere is pretty neat- there's a weird mural in the larger seating area that's worth a peek and a air duct in top of the room that's cleverly painted like a wooden beam- can't get over that. I am a fan. Go here- then go catch a movie at Regent Square theater up the street."
"2","Frosty drafts, the best veggie dog I've ever tasted, and delicious whole wheat-crust pizza.  Thankfully, since their beer selection is vast and ranges from relatively cheap to ridiculous, the food is generally well-priced.  Toning it down on the drinks can easily bring your bill down to a manageable twenty bucks for two people.  They get a little extra bump from me because they so graciously hosted the Pittsburgh Beer Society for a long time, AND gave PBS members 10% off their beers.  The downside?  Service can be spastic, and I've never seen each person at a table get each of their meals at the same time.  One person can scarf down two (delicious) Chicago dogs long before their partner receives their (equally delicious) calzone.  \n\nBut Omar, hipsters and yuppies?  Aside from the occasional pair of skinny jeans and a trucker cap or two, I've seen mostly families taking advantage of D's great prices and groups of friends chatting and sharing drinks.  It's definitely not a place to go to see and be seen, which suits me just fine."
"2","One of the few reasons I may miss Pittsburgh when I go to grad school. The hot dogs are piled on high with the best, fattiest stuff I can muster up, and the beer selection is one of the best in Allegheny Co. Great for a night out with friends, followed by indie movies at the Regent Square Theatre across the street."
"2","In my final meal in Pittsburgh, I finally had the closest thing to a Pittsburgh sandwich and that was the Big Ben Hot Dog with cole slaw, fries, and a cheese sauce. It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot."
"2","D's is the 'it' place for Pittsburgh... especially for those that like beer. There are several Belgian pubs around Pittsburgh, but D's is a whole different experience. \n\nYes, the cave is like a candy shop. The cave is located in the back of the left side. The first time I went (after reading Yelp reviews) I was a little intimidated to head straight past the bar. It's not like BevMo so don't expect to save a lot on a six pack but if you're interested in sampling and trying out different craft or imported beer it's the place. Plus, who can resist a cheap, filling hot dog?\n\nHm.. hungry. I'm going there now."
"2","I came here with a bunch of Russian language students who go to the University of Pittsburgh, figuring locals and Russian speakers would know the best bars.  I was not wrong.\n\nThis place is absolutely awesome, with an impressive beer selection and great prices.  The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  \n\nFor the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. \n\nThe music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.\n\nTo Rob, ogromnoye spaceba!"
"2","great beer selection and good dogz."

"1","good selection of beers*, but the food is appalling. sysco-truk curly fries and run-of-the-mill hotdogs that don't even have natural casings. puh-leez. if you're gonna put \""dogz\"" in the name of your restaurant at least try to serve something better than what you can get on sale at giant eagle. \n\nno joke: I prefer the O. their fries are made out of potatoes and their dogs have real casings. \n\n* and by \""good\"" I mean \""good for PA\"" where liquor laws are an absurd kafkaesque mess and a lindeman's geuze is about as interesting as it gets (for like $15, natch)"
"2","This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve \""bar food\"", but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs, pizza, and soft pretzels. \n\nYou can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take-out beer for an even larger selection."
"2","First stop on my Midwest Brew Crawl with the BF! \nThe BF ate here once last year and loved it so much that we decided that we needed to make it our first stop on our road trip to Minnesota. We planned our departure time so that we could get here at lunch (it was a mere 7 hour drive!) \nWe both ordered the Bacon Cheese all beef dog (hot dog with bacon and melted cheddar on top) plus a corn dog, dusted wings and two root beers. We didn't try any of the beers on tap since we still had a lot of driving ahead of us. The Bacon Cheese was ridiculously good and I wished that I could have finished it. Unfortunately I hogged pretty much all of the corn dog since it was AMAZING!!!  The wings were also really good, maybe even among the top three chicken wings that we had the whole trip.\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the Pittsburgh area or anyone who is crazy enough to drive 7 hours for a hot dog."
"1","I'm over it. \n\nToo many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. \n\nThe beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.\n\n(The Monroeville location is better, imo.)"
"2","I'm not from PA, I'm from VA.  In VA I worked at a wine and beer bar, where we served and I tasted some of the best beers in the world.  And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  \n\nAlso, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally, parking sucks there's a lot of very busy restaurants and businesses on the same street, so expect to walk a little."
"2","Draft Belgian beer and a Mason Dixon dog."
"2","Enter into D's (after figuring out the correct door - I still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. For Chrissakes, they have Delirium on tap! The real jewel, though, is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery, perhaps the best beer I've ever had.\n\nWhile D's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not bad either. The pizza is average, but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.\n\nFinally, bring a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding."
"2","Beer cave!!"
"1","I don't understand the hype for D's, although I guess their beer selection *does* rule.  If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. \n\nI know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.  If this was just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd be forgiving, but 3 years is long enough to judge."
"1","Obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  A lot of bottles.  Decent tap selection, though you are guaranteed to have a rather lopsided selection among the taps.\n\nFood is fair; I've yet to go there with others and have our whole meal come out at once.  Salad will come first, then a couple of dogs, then fries.  If you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served, well, let's just say that no one ever taught the manager, cooks or servers here that lesson.\n\nNow, their service:  Really lackluster.  \""Entitled\"" is the word I would use.  It pains me to give them 15%, because honestly, they don't earn it, even when I was a regular and knew some of them by name. Meh."
"2","Everyone is so nice, tons of different beers to choose from, including a mix your own 6 pack deal and, just 3 words, Mason Dixon Dog!"
"2","D's is a fantastic place with food! Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere! Can get crowded but that's because it's soooo good! I love the selection of beer, it always me to try out a new beer without having to buy a whole case!"
"2","I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However, I am huge on add-ons. This is where D's comes in. I totally recommend the chihuahua hot dog. It has avocado!!! The wings are delish too. This place is a must go for beer lovers. I am still the light and sweet kinda beer person, so I tried something with raspberry notes in it, and LOVED it! Oh and the fries are awe-frickin-some!! My second fave in the city after Point Brugge."
"1","Awful service; took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items (then added a few beers we didn't order on to our tab; I'm assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice.) Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check? In the time we argued about it, you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.\n\nHad to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful, with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch. I would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if I could have; but we got gratted so I didn't even have that option.\n\nIf you want to come here with more than 3 people, avoid D's. Their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer I can get at Sharp Edge for $6? no thanks!) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn other words, don't come here. I used to like this place, but tonight was such a bad experience I'll just go to one of the other places in Pittsburgh that serves hot dogs, french fries and beer. There are plenty of them, I won't miss D's at all."
"2","Crowded bar atmosphere, spectacular beer selection, good bar food.  Great hot dogs."
"2","we love to go to this place when we are in visiting the in-laws. it's a great place to meet up with old friends, order greasy food, drink craft beer, and catch up in a relaxed setting. The place can get kind of loud at night so make sure your group of friends aren't hard of hearing. The craft beer selection is excellent. You can make your own six pack to go or drink any one of the unique beers in-house. They also have beers on tap for a cheap price. Food wise, their wings are decent and the pizza is greasy and cheesy. The place is pretty bare bones 'burgh style. Not trying to be something it's not, but still offering unique, quality beer from around the world. For that I give it my fandome and return business."
"2","It was either Mother Theresa or the Baha Men who said \""Who let the dogs out?\"" and I must say, I was glad someone let my bacon cheddar dog out of the kitchen and into my stomach.  Dee-licious!\n\nStopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers, dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of \""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"" so this was a while ago.)\n\nAlso, since I was just visiting town, I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!\n\nSo the point is, you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer, and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie."
"2","Yum! I think Ive been here three times since moving to PGH, \n\nFav dogs: Chihuahua , Brat, and Chicago style dog. Never tried other entrees but their fries are nice and crispy. \n\nThey have plenty of Belgian beers to choose from a bonus in my beer book.\n\nBeers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back. \n\nWarning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first. \n\nAlso this doesn't really bother me i still ate my food but the guy cooking the food didn't wear gloves and did touch the food with his bare hands often. If you're OCD maybe just get a beer or don't sit at the bar where you can see this. Don't worry he didn't pick anything up off the floor and put it back on plates, i checked. :)"
"2","This place is like my second home. Not just because of the beer. Not just because of the great food - like hot dogs, pizza, burgers, salads.  But, because I just love the atmosphere there. The staff is awesome. The people who eat/drink there are always there to just have a good time while enjoying having a few great beers.\nI recommend this place for anyone that just wants a beer, anyone who loves hot dogs, etc.  Their pizza is actually REALLY good.\n\nOh, and they have gluten free beers, which is good since I don't eat/drink anything with gluten in it!"
"2","This is paradise for beer connoisseurs. A range of beer that confuses, bedazzles and quenches you thirst for quality brews. The selection on lager and ales on tap as well as in the 'beer cave' make this place one of a kind. The special hummus, fries, hot dogz, and pizza make it the perfect hangout place any given day in Pittsburgh"
"2","The mac n cheese dog I had was just ok, but the Mason Dixon with its slaw and chili was killer. The fries and barbeque wings were just as good. I also liked the atmosphere, the mural, and the employees who were really nice and honest and helpful. It's in a cool neighborhood too. Go!"
"2","D's is a great dive bar in Regent Square.  I had a Chicago-style dog with bacon, and fries to go, for around $6.  The dog looked like a chef put some real love into it - it was picture perfect, lightly dusted with celery salt, relish tucked in like it was ready for a commercial.  The taste was perfect!  The fries were awesome - batter-dipped, super hot, crispy and just salty enough to not need extra.  I'll definitely be back.  Not a lot of joints know how to do a good Chicago dog.  Good cheap eats."
"2","I love this place. My fiance and I moved to the Regent Square area in May and we've been to D's multiple times in the three or so months since. The food is good--fairly typical bar fare--but it's the beer that keeps bringing us back. Their selection is huge (see: beer cave) and I've had some amazing beers that I didn't know even existed. The employees really know their stuff and will help you pick a beer if you don't know what you want. My fiancee is not a huge beer fan but the bartenders/waitstaff have been successful in finding him something he likes. They also have at least three gluten-free beers for those with gluten sensitivities. The atmosphere is not too loud or crazy and is a nice place to go if you want to be able to hear your companions.\n\nThe sad part is that D's closes fairly early--the bar closes at 11 on Sunday-Wednesday and midnight on Thursday-Saturday. The kitchen closes an hour before the bar."
"2","If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. \n\nWhat? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.\n\nIf you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. \n\nNo? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.\n\nI came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.\n\nWe walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.\n\nOn the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. \n\nTheir beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me. Very nice people those Pittsburgh folk are."
"2","Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too!"
"2","I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!"
"1","I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.\n\nThe first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.\n\n I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place."
"2","Came here for lunch after a long day on the road\n\nIt's a beer and bar place.\n\nThey have a variety of beer, they have a room all the way in the back with lots of different beer and a separate room displaying other kinds of beer.  They also have outdoor seating.  It's like 2 shops next to each other separated by a hall way.  I didn't even know there was a spot next door until I went to the restroom.\n\nThe fries are good.\nThey offer pizza and other goodies too.\nThey have many types of different types of dogs.  I had the veggie red alert which is spicy.  They have 3 kinds of hot dogs so it caters even to the vegetarian.  Regular dog, beef dog and veggie dog.  You have unlimited toppings - mushrooms, onions, creamy avocado etc.  The dog came in this little boat sized paper tray.  I find it very hard to eat because all of the toppings would fall off to the table, but they do have paper towels for you to put underneath if you want to do this so you can eat whatever falls off.  The veggie dog tasted like the real thing.  They also have dogs of the day.  \nQuite an interesting place but worth the visit in a little town."
"2","Hot dogs were delicious and fun to mix and match toppings. They do fried dogs too and it's great. Beer selection is obviously fantastic. Check our their beer cave!"
"2","D'z is hands down my favorite go to spot for good eats. I love their wings and their hot dogs. \nEverytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:\n\nI love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. \n\nIf your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. \n\nDue to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z. We truly regret not waiting to go here but time was of the essence. D'z you truly are my favorite spot to be any day at any time and you will always be the place i wish i would have been proposed to at!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","D'z dogs is the best. All the employees seem to want to be here. Nothing is better then when your food provider is excited about what he/she is doing. Come try a scorpion dog.!!!!"
"2","Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park, which I felt gave me license to have a (delicious) hot dog washed down with a few great beers. I can't wait to return!"
"2","Last night was my first time at D's. The beer cave was amazing! I'm not a fan of beer but can appreciate a vast selection. I went straight for the cider. The lively energy of this place was incontestable. No frills, down-to-earth place where you can kick it back with a beer (or in my case a cider) and enjoy company with friends. It was a perfect ending to our movie night at the Regent Square Theater. With smiles planted on our faces after watching a dark comedy, going to D's only extended our happy mood. Before leaving I went back to the beer cave for more cider. Good stuff, good stuff!"
"2","This really is a great place. It's hard to find fault with anything here! Great owner, superb bar food, and oh, the huge selection of craft beer. And I'm not talking about the massive collection in the beer cave!! The commitment to have 5 or 6 local brews (Helltown included) on tap in a rotating  \""local\"" draft corner is music to my ears. Had Helltown's Reaper Harvest Ale last night and it was fabulous. I've had quite a few local brews here as well as a selection of other crafts. I love having exciting draft beer choices!\n\nThe food is really good too! Wings, dogs, veggie dogs...these aren't just your typical ballpark quality dogs. Nah, these are amazing. The buns, the all beef dog with that welcome \""snap\"" when you bite it...yum. Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!\n\nSince they don't serve cheapo food or beer, the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  is close to $25. But hey, enjoy it. The crowd is cool, the atmosphere is terrific, and the beer selection is among the best in the city. I'll keep coming back. For sure!"
"2","Was at D's this afternoon! I was so excited to find real vienna Hot Dogs in Pittsburgh since I am a born and raised Chicago guy. They were good dogs, had mine Chicago Style of course! Not sure it was Pollmans Mustard. It the buns had poppy seeds! A great place with plenty of atmosphere!"
"2","i really like this place and if i were in squirrel hill more often, i'd definitely visit more. there is only one reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, but i'll get to that in a minute.\nthe first i had heard of d's was their six pack shop. they have a large selection of room-temp, cold, domestic, craft, import, normal-size, giant bottles that you can make your own 6 pack with. this was the first place i had ever been to with those kind of options, but now i realize (here's why one star is taken off) the prices for 6 packs are not nearly as wonderful as the selection. now, obviously, with mixed bottles, the price will go up, especially if you have expensive kinds in there. but it seems they charge full price per bottle, which is a pretty lousy deal in the end.\nbut prices for eat/drink-in are totally acceptable! in fact, i don't believe i had ever eaten at d's until a recent yelp event. their hot dogz are FANTASTIC and i only had a beef dog with sauerkraut, not exactly anything fancy. i also got to sample their hummus and dry-rub bbq wings, both of which were also super tasty.\nthe service is always really friendly here too. there's plenty of room to sit down (bar, table, \""loft\"" upstairs with a bar and a few tables). and there's even darts upstairs, too.\nd's is definitely worth checking out and if you've never seen the 6-pack \""cave\"", at least take a browse, buy one if you're feeling spendy or simply don't have a place like this anywhere near you."
"2","Wonderful place for a great casual meal! Their Beer Cave and excellent make your own 6-pack/draft beer selection are well known. As someone who was not able to drink I was equally impressed by their delicious rootbeer also on draft. We had the Vegetarian Pub Fries to start, which was a large helping of french fries smothered in cheese and avocado with a side of ranch. I had the Chihuahua hot dog with a veggie hot dog and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty Octoberfest hot dog. Both were large and delicious. We did not have to wait long for a Friday night and the service was excellent. The space tends to be crowded so this is not the place to go for a quiet fancy dinner, but the food and drinks were excellent and we will definitely be back."
"2","My favorite place in regent square.  you haven't experienced pittsburgh until you've had a hot dog and a beer at d's.if you go on thursday nights the typically have a different brewery featured where they'll have 5 or 6 of their beers on tap"
"2","D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. \n\nTheir beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. \n\nSince we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.\n\nFor a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's."
"2","Went here today for the first time and I couldn't be more pleased with my experience. We sat downstairs in the dining area, on the same side where they keep all their beers. We were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us. My boyfriend and I each ordered a draft beer. He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome and their draft list is decent. About 15-20 craft beers on tap. \n\nWe each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food, definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalape\u00f1os. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection.. Over 1,000 beers in their beer room (all beers are warm) but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not a bad selection. \n\nI honestly couldn't be happier with my experience."
"2","As if this place needs another glowing review!\n\nWhen I first moved to Pittsburgh, a local clued me in to the wonders of D's. She leaned forward and whispered, \""....yeah 'suchandsuchbar' is alright, but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff, go to D's Six Pax and Dogz.\"" \n\nShe proceeded to give me directions. Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) \n\nWalking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better, you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go. \n\nBobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course, this isn't D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive. \n\nI love this place so good."
"2","Best fries around and a really good beer selection.  A little bit of a drive for us, but we always find a reason to go.  The staff is beyond friendly"
"2","I absolutely loved this place. First off, I love Regent Square. It's the cutest place, and this is the perfect place for a night out or even to get beer for a night in. My boyfriend is obsessed with the create your own six pack from the beer cave. We ate here on a friday and the place was packed but we got sat right away and our food came out fast. Amazing specialty hummus of the day ( i think it was chipotle ranch) and great sandwiches. The portions are huge and you won't leave hungry."
"2","I agree with others that the beer cave is wonderful.  I could stay in there for hours!  The pizza ain't bad either!"
"2","I've been trying to find new and different restaurants recently, and this is one I found:\n\nAbout the place:\n- It's small\n- It's packed and crowded.\n- Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward and can't be comfortable.\n- I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.\n- There is free parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space\n\nThe food:\n- NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.\n- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries.\n- The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.\n- You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest.\n- The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.\n\nThe staff:\n- They are overworked but they are nice.\n- One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.\n\nSuggestions for D's:\n- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!\n- Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.\n- Try to get a bigger place\n- Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.\n\nWould I go back? Definitely."
"1","While awaiting the arrival of your wedding dress, you should feel excitement and joy, not desparation and hopelessness.  The delivery date was \""pushed back\"" many times until it finally came in over 3 months after they said it would, and gave me the run-around throughout the entire process.  I didn't think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest.  I had un-returned phone calls and was lied to by Donetta, the owner.  Janie was the consultant I worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful; however, the store overall struggles and I would never go back.  If you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place.  Seriously, take my word for it.  I ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what I went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come.  I have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Shame on me.  Check out the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  Brides by Candalina is rated an F.  They have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really don't care. Shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life, not a nightmare.  There are many other bridal shops-avoid this one."
"1","I went to pick up my wife's bridesmaid dress (she was the maid of honor) on a very boring Wednesday afternoon around 12:30. From the outside the place looks like a bomb shelter with dresses in the window.\n\nThe show room is upstairs, but you would never know it from the drab, basement-like entrance. As I walked up the stairs I notices ZERO customers in the store, however; two employees were working on the sales floor. I stood there like a jerk for a bit while both employees (one was the owner) kept to themselves. The owner did not respond to me for, at least, 10 minutes even though the store was empty and another employee was just walking around \""dusting\"" (the store smalls like the inside of a mascot costume).\n\nWhen the owner, finally, saw me she made a little annoying noise like \""What the hell are YOU doing here!!\"". She walked over slowly, like a zombie looking for fresh brains and giving a crap why I was there. She asked me to follow her as she took me downstairs to an absolutely empty storeroom (by that I mean: what was she doing that was was so important that she couldn't wait on a customer) and took her sweet-ass time to get the dress which, by the way, was a second alteration. You see, they screwed up the first time they altered the dress (even after my wife tried it on there and markings or whatever were made!). So everyone is entitled to a mistake even a business that claims perfection; it's important to give them a chance to redeem themselves. But, to my surprise, she handed me a bill for the second alteration!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!!!\n\nI argued a bit, but then gave in; what was I supposed to do? We were leaving to go 200 miles away the next day for the wedding. So I paid. Do not go here ladies!\n\nOh, if you think I'm exaggerating, feel free to Google this company and read the many reviews that make mine look like a compliment. If you have ever needed a dress for a wedding or YOUR wedding, these reviews will scare you!"
"1","I was pleased that Candalina Bide ordered my gown as a rush and it did arrive in time for the wedding.  The downside:  the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done.  The hem looked as if a high student just learning to sew had done it and I had to make some repairs and press the hem once I got it home.  The alterations to the bodicve were incomplete and i ended up with a poor fit and lots of excess materialright across the bust.  I would order from them again, but definitely take my dress to a professional seamstress."
"1","Last Friday I dropped off my best interview suit at Regency Cleaners and verified that I needed it back by Monday because of an interview on Wednesday. They assured me I could pick it up on Monday morning. \n\nMonday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning, she went into the back and came out with what I first thought was the suit but turned out to be only the jacket. She told me to come back after 5:00PM. When I asked to speak with the manager, she informed me that she was the only person there. I asked her to have the manager call me - she said the manager wouldn't answer the phone and reiterated the 5:00PM time when the last delivery came and petulantly informed me that none of this was her fault.\n\nAt 5:30PM I called and was told that the last delivery hadn't come yet and I'd have to call later. I again asked them to have the manager call me and she told me she couldn't give me the manager's phone number - which I hadn't asked for. I was again told this wasn't her fault. As of 7:00PM, the delivery finally arrived but not my pants.\n\nI was told the manager would call me after she arrived in the morning. I finally called at 9:00AM and was criticized by the manager for demanding her home phone number and told that there was never any guarantee about when clothes would be returned even when a rush was placed on them. \n\nApparently a *lot* of clothes were missing from the Monday delivery so I wasn't the only person upset about this situation.\n\nWhen I told them they'd lost my business for good, I was told that was fine and hung up on, forcing me to call again to find out exactly *when* I might be able to expect my missing pants.\n\nAt this point I'm still waiting and will be for the next three hours. In the meantime, I have to go out and try to find a suit that I can afford as a replacement just in case. \n\nI absolutely cannot recommend Regency Cleaners. They leave high school kids with no customer service experience or training in charge of the store with no manager available for unexpected situations. And there is no guarantee about when or if your clothes will ever come back.\n\nThis was my first and last time dealing with them."
"1","Worst dry cleaners EVER.  \n\nNot only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes, but the staff are particularly nasty and rude.  The kids who work there are fine, but the older ladies are just plain miserable.  I would rather spend more money someplace else than go back to this hell hole."
"1","I only got a tear in my sweater sewn together, but my experience was far from pleasant, even expecting nothing special when I walked into the place.  \n\nI went to the dry cleaner out of convenience as I live right in Regent Square.  I took my sweater to the dry cleaner on 2/19/2013 for a tear in the seem, and they told me it would not be available for pickup on 2/25/2013 after 5:00PM.... almost a week later.  What? \n\nAlso, the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders.  I'm not entirely sure how their cleaning/sewing process works, but it's slow as molasses and I don't have time for that.  Their lack of urgency coupled with their lack of customer service or even cracking a smile means I will never go back to this dry cleaner."
"1","I just moved to the neighborhood and needed to find a dry cleaner close by. Regency Cleaners is fine for dry cleaning but do not entrust any tailoring or hemming to this place! I had the sleeves of my coat hemmed and the tailor (or whoever) did a shitty job (THANKS).\n\nThe owner (larger woman) is rude and dismissive of my questions.\n\nI won't be coming here again."
"1","There's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place. Maybe it's that spending thirty minutes in the main bar area will make you spontaneously asphyxiate.  They seriously need to invest in an air purifier.  The bar itself is a huge space, though very few will ever make it into the back room.  It's essentially a dead zone.  There's a fancy back bar that remains closed so that two bartenders can roost on top of each other like Master/Blaster in Beyond Thunderdome and watch TV.  This kind of forces patrons to hover near the front.  So, uh, invest in a second TV, a nice coat of paint, maybe some dimmer light bulbs.  You know, gussy yourself up a bit Murphy's.  It will make you feel more confident.  Who doesn't want a new coat of paint? Huh? HUH? The reason that this place is a two, is that it has an unbelievable amount of potential that's just squandered."
"2","After reading a majority of the prior reviews of this place, I feel like I should get out the soapbox again, because some of you should be ashamed of yourselves.  Especially the one that never stepped foot inside.  I mean how do you write a review of a place you NEVER experienced.  And all the complaining about the smoke...get used to it.  What did you do years ago when people were allowed to smoke wherever they went?  Yes, I know it's a nuisance.  Yes, I am a smoker myself, but I have enough common sense to be a polite smoker (this is my personal choice, and it is your personal choice not to smoke, as it is a business' choice to allow or not allow smoking in its establishment).\n\nAnyway, let's move forward.  I was skeptical of this place long before ever reading reviews, and long before I discovered Yelp.  The outside of the bar looks old, which may have been a factor in deterring me for so long.  It looks like it would be a one room tiny bar, but looks are deceiving, it is actually a big space.\n\nThe front is a typical barroom.  The bar takes up a good part of the room.  But there is a fair amount of space for people to walk about freely when going to the door.  Behind the bar is a small seating area where there are bar stools.  In the back of the place they appear to have just about everything you would expect a bar to have.  Pool table, multiple dart boards, and I even believe a shuffleboard table.  I cannot speak of how it is in the back as I only glanced on my way to the bathroom.  The bathroom I had used however, was rather small.  Just enough room for you to do your business and turn around to wash your hands.\n\nThe staff here on the particular night I attended were polite, funny and nice to chat with.  They were knowledgeable about the brews on tap and every beer they had in stock.  The drinks, by the way, were truly amazing.  Just the right mixture of everything when they made up your drink of choice.  And just to make sure you were enjoying the drink, the bartender came back around and asked if it was to your liking.  The bartender even made sure it wasn't too strong and offered to add to the drink to balance it better.\n\nAs for the limited food they had to offer, I cannot really talk about.  The food I did see that patrons ordered looked palatable, so on my next visit I might give it a try.  I have to say, that any place that offers popcorn for $.25 is alright by me (better than having it sitting on the bar and you have no idea who has put their hands in there)."
"1","I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc.  She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.  They refuse to put in the ramp.  I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship.  Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!  SHAME ON YOU CATHY!"
"2","I was referred to Edgewood Dental Associates by a friend (who happens to be a doctor). My experience was so positive I feel compelled to pass on this great find. The staff is professional and friendly - they looked up what my insurance covered before I sat down.  They keep digital records (vs. old skewl film x-rays) and you can book your appointment online and do your paperwork in advance.  The office is clean and up-to-date. Plus, the reception area has nice amenities - espresso, current magazines etc.\nhttp://www.edgewooddentalassociates.com/"
"1","Let me start off by saying, I HATE the dentist.  It is my worst fear.  I came to Edgewood Dental after stellar reviews.. and let me tell you my first impression was amazing.  They were professional, so nice, easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that I didn't feel a thing.  Although I had 7 cavities filled (my teeth are horrible) I felt good that they did a good job.  Flash forward 3 months later, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings.  First, I was very upset that I was never told of this downgrade.  I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.  Meanwhile, I have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill.  I have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word.  Jerks."
"2","Best dentist ever!!\n\nI had a stretch of maybe five years where I didn't go to the dentist at all. I was pretty anxious about going since it had been quite some time. My first time going to Edgewood Dental, everyone was really nice, respectful, and professional. No one criticized me or made me feel bad that I hadn't gone for awhile. The staff is also very knowledgeable and very open to any questions you have or anything you'd like to discuss with them.\n\nI now have been going twice a year, and it's pleasant experience (never thought I'd say that about the dentist!).  The office is very nice, clean, and modern. There are many nice \""extras\"" such as free beverages (water, etc) in the lobby and I was even offered an iPod to listen to music when I had a filling done. They also have very flexible hours - open pretty early as well as late some evenings.\n\nI will most definitely keep going to Edgewood  Dental as long as I live in this area."
"2","This is a charming little place overshadowed by D'z Dogs (which is amazing as well) but we're not always in the mood for hot dogs and french fries. Dunnigan's provides an adequate bar with daily specials. The menu is an upgrade from your typical bar/grill. Of course the star item on the menu would have to be the French Onion soup which boasts rich broth soaked up by a thick slice of chewy bread that holds up well and plentiful caramelized onions all smothered by gooey cheese broiled until bubbling to golden perfection. Mmmm.....\n\nThe restaurant is roomy and comfortable. Perfect for a nice night out with your sweetheart."
"1","Yeah, not impressed. We ordered the fried zucchini to start. It's great that it's freshly hand battered, but they seem to have forgotten something -- the FLAVOR. This stuff had no seasoning on it at all, so we have to pour on a generous helping of salt to get it to taste like anything. And for $8 that's disappointing.\n\nWe each ordered burgers. At $10 a pop I was expecting a nice juicy burger. What I got was dry and totally tasteless. The whole burger just tasted like nothing. Perhaps their salt shaker fell on the floor and rolled under the fridge or something tonight. It was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For a $40 night out I really shouldn't have to dump salt all over everything I order. \n\nThe service...meh. Our server was so meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes a bit of personality, no? When we asked what the happy hour specials were, she said \""Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends on the drink.\"" What? What does that mean? Basically it means you get a random discount on whatever you order, maybe, perhaps. There is no list, no standard \""$5.00 well drinks\"" or anything normal like that. It's basically \""order something and hope it's on our happy hour specials.\""\n\nRather disappointed. They need to either lower their prices or kick it up a notch on the food and service."
"1","Dark, spacious, and neighborhood friendly is how I'd describe Dunnings, a fixture on Braddock Ave for years. \n\nI met my friend Jean here, she is a once a week customer. Lucky her living on Biddle Street, she lunches daily at different eateries on Braddock ave. One day the Square Cafe (read my review), one day the Map Room, another day D's Packs n Dogs. \n\nLooking over the menu, my choices were limited to a veggie wrap or salads. I chose a veggie wrap, sans cheese with a side of apple sauce. The wrap was nothing special, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, tomato, and a side of canned applesauce.\n\nJean had a buffalo chicken wrap and iced tea. She complained the tea was weak, I never noticed. She said he wrap was good, a chicken breast fried, then drenched in buffalo chicken sauce, then drenched in blue cheese dressing and wrapped in a flour tortilla. \n\nDunnings is nothing special, it's a long time establishment that gets by on regulars. This day, the most I saw in the place was 9 people in the bar and dinning room. \n\nService was ok, out waitress seemed to be preoccupied with something or someone in the kitchen and it took forever for her to bring the bill to the table."
"1","I live in Regent Square and have been to Dunning.s about a half-dozen times over the past several years.  It was never a great restaurant, in fact, it was never even an average restaurant.  At best, the food was mediocre, and the only time that I would eat here was when I was too tired to get in my car and travel the three or so miles to the Union Grill in Oakland (which offers similar fare as Dunning.s - and does an incomparably better job of it).\n\nRecently, however, things have taken a nosedive at Dunning's.  I now consider Dunning's to be the single worst restaurant in the city that I've ever had the misfortune of entering.  \n\nI recently had the worst restaurant service experience of my life at Dunning's when our waitress first ignored our party, then hurried us through our order, then left us sit for over 20 minutes waiting for food with empty drinks.  We then received terrible food (soggy sandwiches, brown lettuce in a salad, and cold french fries - stone cold), and when we complained about our fries, the waitress launched into an angry tirade (nearly yelling at us) about how it wasn't her fault, that she just picks up the food, and that there wasn't anything she could do about it.  When I asked to speak to the manager, he just shook his head sadly and offered us free desserts.  I told him that I didn't want to eat anything that came out of a kitchen that clearly showed that the people working in it simply didn't care - at all, and we didn't want to eat anything, not even the food sitting in front of us, and just wanted to pay our bill and leave.  He said that he was going to \""comp\"" our meal.  \n\nIt was a disastrous experience - the single worst restaurant experience of my life - and I will never return until the restaurant is under new management.  It is crystal-clear that the current manager and/or owner isn't doing his job, and I cannot understand how anyone would choose to spend their hard-earned money at this establishment when virtually every other restaurant in town offers far better service and food.  \n\nIn short: no one - not the manager, not the waitresses, not the cooks - cares about the customer.  Not at all."
"2","Yes. As the previous folks have said, Dunnings is really nothing special, in terms of what most people percieve as a special dining experience. I beg to differ. I always have great, prompt service and the same window seat every time I come here. Then again, I always come in the middle of the afternoon and only order one drink and the French Onion Soup. However I have had dinner here before.\n\nI like Dunnings because it is not tying to be anything other than an old school, family friendly, bar-restuarant. It is a Regent Square staple, and the folks that come here seem to be staples as well. There is a Cheers vibe (early 80's sitcom\nabout a Boston bar where \""everyone knows your name\"") and that seems to fare very well with the local residents. After living in Los Angeles for all of my 20's, I find this kind of environment comforting and  refreshing.\n\nFor the life of me, I cannot remember what I had for dinner here. I guess that may be a testament to the mediocre food.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a low key, mellow, old school (dark wood, framed pictures of landscapes a'la Rembrandt) place to check out, have a casual drink and appetizer, Dunnings is your spot.   I feel bad that the previous folks had crappy service, but if you come here with an open mind and the correct expectations, you will love this place as much as I do.\n\nAlso, it is Regent Theater adjacent, so it is also the perfect spot to have a quick drink/ appetizer before a film."
"1","Average food, slightly above average prices for the quality/taste, average price for the location, lack-luster service.\n\nThis place (the location, the actual building itself, etc.) could be so much more.  I wish they would either step it up, or sell the business to someone that would let it achieve its true potential.\n\nUntil then, there are other dining options in Regent Square and they should be explored."
"2","I love Dunning's.  When I want a good burger, this is the place I visit.  Even when they're busy, I can count on getting my burger the way I ordered it.  The portions are HUGE.  The downside is that this place can be noisy and the wine prices are too high for a 4 ounce pour.  Otherwise, the service is good, the food consistent, and the atmosphere pleasant for a neighborhood pub."
"1","I really wanted to like this place, because it sounds like it used to be really popular. We heard the burgers were very good once upon a time, so we tried them, but they were just ok. Nice people though, and plenty of seating. Good place to watch the game probably (bar)."
"2","Friendly and prompt service.  The French onion soup is great. The prices are a bit more than what one should pay for standard fare. Otherwise great place."
"2","I decided to visit the reagent square location after reading the great reviews on here and i wasn't disappointed. Parking was relatively easy to get (Tuesday afternoon). The store is well organized not too overwhelming like most thrift/vintage stores. They carried alot of Jcrew, Ralph Lauren, Ann Taylor stuff...cashmere cardis, blazers blouses etc.  But they also carried a range of  high end stuff, i spotted 2 Oscar de la Renta sweaters, some St Johns blazers, a Prada bag. They also carry some vintage jewelry, scarves and handbags. \nIf you take the time to go through the racks you will definitely score some unique HIGH QUALITY , no funky smells goodies.As far as their prices i noticed that average price was 23-35 and the major designer stuff was between 60-100.They also have a sales rack at the back (was 75% off when i was there).  I knocked off one star because i thought the prices were abit higher than i'm used to in Denver (esp on the jewelry) \n I walked out with a vintage (60's) Pucci dress($88) in perfect condition and an Adrienne Vittadini sweater ($17).  All profits go to a women's shelter which means minimal buyers remorse...hell yess!!!"
"1","I am updating my review of the Oakmont store after my last experience consigning there. The store employee happily accepted all of my items- until the next day when I received a call that the owner rejected half of the items. This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont, and I only offered items that I thought were in excellent condition from high end retailers; even though I have seen brands in the store from Charter Club for example (Ambiance says they do not accept them in the consigning agreement). The employee was very apologetic and she said that she stood by her assessment that the items were of good quality, but the owner (who she seemed upset with) disagreed. So, get your stuff together Ambiance owner and either train your employees better, or only accept items yourself so that you do not inconvenience potential customers like me. Surprisingly, I did not receive the same return on this set of consigned items; not sure if that is coincidence or not."
"1","Right, so......\n\nFirst off, hire employees that actually appreciate having a job.  Not ones that are there because they are forced to.  That way, maybe you can actually earn a decent review.  If you start off with a bad experience with an employee, you're not going to get a great review.\n\nI went here midday on a Sunday.  Thought that was a great idea, especially when I got there and there were no cars in the drive thru.  Pull up to the sign to order and wait for five minutes before I am even acknowledge that I am there.  Finally order and pull around, I wait another five minutes.  I could understand the wait if there was someone in front of me, or if the sit down area inside was packed, but there was no one else there but ME.\n\nI'd gladly tell y'all the employee's name, that is if where the name is suppose to be wasn't ripped off.  All I can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine.  I was made to feel like I was interrupting her day and that I should have just went somewhere else to spend my money.\n\nYou know what really puts me in a tizzy (yes, I just used that word)?  Leaving the drive thru, driving the distance to my house, walking into my house, sitting down to feed my face and find that part of my order wasn't given to me.  *enter angry expletives here*\n\nI doubt I'll be revisiting this location again, I'll drive the further distance from my place the next time I'm craving a taco or two."
"1","The drive through service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy."
"1","This place continues to be a joke.  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse.  \n\nMy order is never right and yet I still go...never again.  \n\nI officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh."
"1","Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad."
"1","While the shop is in a pretty great location, with cute decor, they only accept cash (which is annoying), and the friendliness of the staff varies significantly, from awesome to terrible. I could deal with either--and have, given my love of coffee shops--but I guess I need consistency. I want to know what to expect, you know?\n\nTheir coffee is pretty good--not awesome, but certainly drinkable. Their pastries vary a bit, as well; that they offer carrot cake cupcakes is pretty cool, but I think something's wrong with their fridge, making things stale half the time.\n\nKind of meh.\n\n(Note on \""outdoor seating:\"" It's really no good unless you smoke, because there's one employee who spends half the day out there, smoking.)"
"1","The place smells awful.   Its non-smoking, but reeks of stale smoke, and when I spend 1/2 an hour there, I leave smelling like smoke.  This isn't an isolated incident, but it really smells every time I've been in there (at least once a month for the past couple years).\n\non the up side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location."
"1","I really want to see small coffee shops succeed, I do. Regent Square is full of small businesses and the community is really supportive. I believe this and the lack of coffee chains is the only reason they are still open. They are cash only, but so is half of all the other businesses on that street, so I don't hold it against them. \n\nIt's dingy. They don't use their space well. Coffee is brewed in poured into an regular old coffee pump pot. The desserts looked good, but there was one lonely cookie and two cupcakes (granted it was Saturday night). It just looked really sparse."
"1","This is a depressing coffee shop. I went in on a wednesday afternoon to find the place dim, muggy, eerily silent (as in no music or talk, just shuffling noises), and filled with a sense of sadness.  I tried to sit down and enjoy some coffee, which was drinkable, but I couldn't get over the odd atmosphere, that is until the music started, so quiet I couldn't even tell you what it was, just that it was on. I'm giving it two stars for the awesome alternative energy posters hanging on the far wall."
"1","Regent Square is a nice little area, and it certainly deserves a better coffee shop than Katerbean.\n\nWe just moved to Pittsburgh in July, and before we got the interwebs in our home, we would frequent Katerbean fairly regularly, at least 2 to 3 times per week in order to use their free wi-fi and have a drink.  Every time... EVERY TIME we went there, we left reeking of smoke.  There's no smoking inside, of course, but it always happened.  Maybe it's due to poor ventilation, or the fact that the employees were regularly outside smoking, but we always left smelling like we were in a bar.\n\nThen, the tables were usually dirty.  When we would order our drink, we would usually have to get ourselves a napkin, wet it, and wipe our table ourselves. Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.\n\nIn any case, we have internet access at home now, and haven't been back to Katerbean since. I guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it."
"1","Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables, I agree with the other reviews here.  I think the \""Manager\"" only hires other smokers, and they spend 90% of their time sitting outside smoking, instead of being prepared to serve customers.  \n\nI go there because sometimes it's convenient, b/c of the location, but last week they left their A/C broken for over a week (in 80+ degree weather).  No additional fans, nothing.\n\nThen when it was fixed, I went in, ordered coffee and an order of hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged).  Not only was the hummus watery from sitting in that container for several days, but the celery was rotting at the ends, yes brown and rotting.  I showed the kid working there, who was probably jonesing to have his next cigarette, and I asked for another one.  Without opening it I could see at least 2-3 of the other servings of hummus were also all watery and had celery that was starting to rot, just like the one I was given.  I asked for my money back.  You know what was the worst thing, though?  The kid (he knows nothing about customer service let alone food service) put the containers with the watery, rotting celery back in the case, to serve to other unsuspecting customers!  Hello, Allegheny County Health Department?....\n\nThen the ultimate insult: 2 kids came in selling candy bars.  I've seen this there before, but this time, I said to them: \""You know, this is a business, you shouldn't be here.\""  Well, the older of the 2 girls (probably 11-12 at most - where is her mother?) put her hands on her hips and said in a smart-ass tone: \""We asked da owner, we is allowed ta be here.\""\n\nWell, that coffee I spent $2 on?  That is the last money I will spend in that place.  Disgusting."
"1","My guess is that \""Ruth K.\"" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \""business\"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\n\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\n\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."
"1","I really want this place to be awesome, because, yet again, I want Regent Square to be an up and coming area.  This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  \n\nThe three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \""The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\""  \n\nToday (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me?'.  The charming reply: \""Yeah?\"" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.\n\nShe's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.\n\nThis place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  \n\n(side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)\n\nOkay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue."
"1","Ughhhh, Katerbean is the abusive boyfriend that I keep coming back to and hate myself for it. There is nothing else around and convenience wins today due to the snow, and my extreme exhaustion and need for caffiene.\n\nWhy, do you ask? I just asked the gal behind the counter, kindly, if I could borrow a pen for a moment. I got an annoyed sigh, an eye roll  and zero eyecontact. Really? I asked for a pen, not a kidney. \n\nMy pleading for a coffee shop intervention from someone, anyone, is now a red alert! Help us RS residents, please!"
"1","Yeah, I'm not coming here anymore.\n\n1) They charge extra for whipped cream.\n2) They use canned whipped cream. If you're gonna charge me for whipped cream you damn well better make your own fresh whipped cream. Jeez.\n3) My hot chocolate was just gross. Like they use Hershey's chocolate syrup or something. Yuck.\n4) I saw how they keep their filters prefilled with ground coffee just sitting out on the counter to get stale! WTF?\n\nSigh. I hope the people at Biddle's Revenge open that place up soon and know WTF they are doing..."
"1","Is it possible to give zero stars?  If so, Katerbean would rate a zero.\n\nBad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow and reluctant service, pump your own coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables.  If they only had telescreens which couldn't be switched off, then this place would be a perfect setting to film Orwell's \""1984\""."
"1","Cigarette smoke and ashtray smells combined with mediocre coffee and subpar customer service are not my cup of tea, and I never even rank the tea here. Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that Biddle's Escape opened and now I have absolutely no reason to go to Katerbean."
"1","This place is now closed :-). Best thing that could've been done with it.  Going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the 61B caf\u00e9. I look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place!"
"2","Long story short - I lost the heel of my favorite pair of well-worn boots - a decade-old pair of Coach leather riding boots that were in otherwise excellent condition. I brought them in tears to Edgewood Shoe Repair thinking they could never be fixed and it would be like losing an old friend. Two days and seven bucks (SEVEN BUCKS !!!) I had them back in absolutely perfect condition, and with a free shine thrown in ! They looked as good as the day I bought them. I honestly can't tell that it had any work done on it at all - the friendly, welcoming shoemaker's skill is THAT good ! I'm now going through my closet looking for other shoes that I thought were goners as I just know this magical man can bring them back to life as well. Can I give more than five stars ? Truly a hidden gem in Edgewood..."
"2","Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.\n\nNow to be clear, this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like. There is no ambiance. No \""decor\"". No table service. No boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is \""infused\"". You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.\n\nBut if you want a delicious cheesesteak, I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else. \n\nThe two best hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  - Rudy's and the Triangle bar."
"2","I think triangle hoagies are great for parties and tailgates.  I normally order one or two battleships and all the fixings.  They are huge, they are reasonably prices, they are prepared quickly, and they are delicious!  I definitely will be back for more soon!"
"1","I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years.  They have the BEST subs ever. \n\nBUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.  They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest.  Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.  Shame on them."
"2","I'll make this short and sweet.  I grew up in the Pittsburgh area and now have retired at the central California Coast. I have tried hoagies throughout the United States and the hoagies made at the Triangle Bar in Swissvale are BY FAR the absolute best hoagies in the United States of America!!!!  When I go back and visit Pittsburgh, the Triangle Bar is a MUST stop and I usually buy a couple of extra hoagies so that I can bring them home on the plane to California and enjoy them here!!!\n\nThe Best of the Best!!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","I love hoagies, and this place has some of the best I've ever had!\n\nSaw them on a Rick Sebak doc and of course had to check it out. Totally lives up to the hype. A true gem in Swissvale."
"2","Growing up in Swissvale, we got a battleship for every football game, birthday party, and so on.. now in my late 20's my mom and I still have a ritual of going out to shop and then to each grab a battleship for dinner at our separate homes at least once a month. In over 20 years I can not think of a single bad experience with the place, other than the long wait which I will forgive because it's totally worth it."
"2","Great place for lunch. Excellent subs on amazing bread. Fresh, fast and healthy! \n\nBetter than any chain sub shop. \n\nHad the 6 inch torpedo. The battleship is huge!!!!!!! \n\nThey have an ATM inside and only take cash."
"2","Amazing! I prefer it over Vincent's, as long as it's veltre's in swissvale! and it's amazing!"
"1","Pizza was fine but nothing special. The salad I ordered was wrong, though. And beware of the prices: What's on the website is wrong. And the manager and owner will say there's nothing they can do about that (except charge you the higher price that isn't on the website)."
"1","This is the closest grocery store to me, and I go out of my way to avoid it.  Finding a parking spot is horrible with stop signs everywhere right in front of the main entrance to the store.\n\nEverything is all out of place and it's hard to make a connection as to where a product might be located in the store.  Mind you there are in the middle of a remodel, so I may come back and make and addendum to my review at a later date after the dust settles.  \n\nAs prices go, they are the norm for the Pittsburgh area.  Variety, yeah, they got that covered.  Tidiness, they are working on that."
"1","This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again."
"2","With the recent update at this location it is much easier to navigate the store.  It's nicer, bigger and has a better selection of ready made foods.  It's amazing how a remodel can make an establishment a much better place to shop.\n\nStill putting on a few finishing touches here and there, but I might actually stop in more frequently to pick up something quick to eat at the ready made counters.  It'll make it easier when I'm running late after the gym to just pick it up and go from here.\n\nParking lot is still a mess, but will hardly ever change.\n\nOh, watch out too, they have applied for a liqueur license to be able to sell six packs with their addiction of a cafe...smart move Giant Eagle.  Not very many places in the Swissvale/Edgwood area to go pick up a quick brew."
"1","I really don't get Giant Eagle. They are nice enough, but pricing just makes no sense at all to me. It is close to my house so I'll drop in to buy a thing or two, but would rather go just about anywhere else for my weekly shopping trip."
"1","I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. \nThe prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to."
"1","One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food."
"1","Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous."
"1","Nothing special, it is Kmart after all.  \n\nDeals are hard to come by, but you have to just look a little bit longer.  It is true that the employees really don't seem to care that they are at work.  I can relate, I did my time in retail.  Although I left it when my time was due.  \n\nGood for the area if you don't want to run to a nearby shopping area."
"1","Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly, they did have thermal socks for women which I almost purchased). I go stand in the check out line, and I don't think I've ever dealt with slower people than those who work here (and that's saying something). Not one, but two of the registers I stood in line at froze, and the women had to wait for the manager to fix.  They didn't seem to mind at all, which leads me to believe this happens all of the time. I waited for my beau who bought something after I did: another 15 minute wait.  Needless to say, I will not go here again."
"1","First off, I like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible. Sometimes that's not possible - in the future I'll avoid this one no matter what.\n\nIts always a zoo, the servers are not interested in what they are doing, and do it poorly. Food comes out of order or not at all. The managers don't care. \n\nWe actually had a waitress spill the soup, catch most of it in her hand, and dump it back in right in front of us. Then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another. \n\nJust go anywhere else, it can't be worse!"
"1","Nothing special. Precooked meals that taste microwaved."
"1","Normally one would think, one chain restaurant is just like the rest but I have had nothing but problems here. The staff appears to be constantly changing as does the managers which should tell you something. I've been there for lunch and dinner and continue to have issues. Here are just some of the problems that we have had: a co-worker had an entire glass of iced tea dropped on him and nothing was comped on his check; we have had to wait a very long time for our orders to be taken; I ordered the pick 2 and was told that the soup could not possibly come out first(even though I've done this before); they have argued with us over what the meal is supposed to come with to the point of us showing them a picture; and staff does not appear to be properly trained."
"1","Worst Applebee's experience I've had.\n\nWe were seated and then waited 10 minutes to even be greeted.  And then it was only because we flagged someone down.  No apologies when we were finally taken care of.\n\nI needed to ask for water three times before I finally went up to the bar to ask for some.  It was then that our server came over with water.  We ordered soup and entrees.  He delivered one soup and an appetizer claiming that was what we ordered and there was no way he misheard.\n\nAbout five minutes later a manager came over and said something to the lines of \""I understand that you've had some issues\""  I then proceeded to very calmly explain what our issues had been.  You could tell he wasn't very interested in what we had to say and didn't seem to care that his server had issues.  His lack of caring was apparent in the fact that while we were waiting to be greeted and during one of the many asks for water, there were several servers and the manager standing behind the bar shooting the breeze.\n\nThe food (once the order was right) was good, but the wait and the mistakes make it highly unlikely we will never return to this location."
"1","I told everyone that I wasn't feeling this. Should have listened to my gut on this one. We didn't make reservations for our party of 7, which I suppose we should have. They had to create space for us. Like really create it. Where we were all sitting in the walkway. Knew I was in the walkway when the waiter asked for us to move so that a little girl in a wheelchair could get around. But I didn't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building. And while you're eating too...it's so disgusting. The place is so freakin crowded as well...maybe just because I hate being in crowded and tight spots. \nAs far as the menu, I wasn't impressed. It took me 20 mins to find something (partly because I'm picky). But I ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo, nothing to rave about. I wanted more broccoli than what was provided, but oh well. The lime/kiwi lemonade was pretty good though."
"1","Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again."
"1","They took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  They'll make one for you especially but I always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.\n\nPlus, this one is always really quiet.  Like, I feel guilty, like I'm troubling the staff.  And you have to drive through an apartment's parking lot to get there.  Very awkward location and atmosphere."
"1","I have been going to Benihana's back when it was Samuri... I visit the Cleveland and Pittsburgh one frequently. The cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. I keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. They have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. The shrimp the order they give you the food, the way the cut the veggies. Im becoming a Huge fan of Itchiban both the one in robinson and cranberry, Its cheaper and you get more food for your money . I hope Beni's changes. I even e mailed them and they didnt respond ."
"2","I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion."
"2","The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back."
"1","Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?  No, unfortunately not.at.all...anymore.  From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya know?\n\nTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \""I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\""\n\nUpon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nOur chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \""waiting for the rice.\""  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  \n\nTwo hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  \n\nMy final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come..."
"1","I have to admit, I kind of thought Benihana was fictitious until we moved to Pittsburgh... and then low and behold, there was one right near where we live. The food is okay. There are better hibachi options in the area. The service can be okay or awful. One time, we were there with our kids and had an absolutely EVIL waitress. One of my kids isn't a big eater, so instead of ordering her a full kids' meal, we just got a side order of rice and soup. The kids' meal her brother was having came with ice cream, so when we were done with dinner, we asked if she could get ice cream as well. I don't know if she thought we wanted the ice cream free (which we definitely didn't!) but she said no, we absolutely COULD NOT order ice cream separately. You either get it with the kids' meal or you don't get it. WTF?"
"2","The sushi during happy hour is great. The wife and I eat well for $20.  That's drinking pop though.  Don't judge."
"1","Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere, service was fine, but our dinner was average to poor. The salad dressing was tasteless, the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy.  It tasted more steamed than hot grilled. The shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful.\nOur chef ( new and slow) compulsively wiped his knives and the grill (which was dirty when we sat down) with a dirty rag? \nI guess a lot depends on the chef you get but ours cooked a tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered at the table looked good. \n\nWe are not big on the circus atmosphere of Saga, but the Wexford location does have the best hibachi food in Pittsburgh to our taste."
"2","Love this place! Great sushi and have great sushi specials at lunch and HH. Bartenders are the best also. Marty is the man!"
"1","Many great memories and great experience at Benihana BUT last night WAS NOT! Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal, could he go find.. NO! Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really?!? Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies?? From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was \""I can take picture now for you\"" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post. WOW & BOO!!! And sad : ("
"1","This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at."
"1","This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat"
"1","This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday, and I will never be going back. Service was mediocre, but the food was the real travesty.\nYou go to Hibachi for a show, but it's not fun when the cook makes the SAME Giant Eagle joke the entire time.  He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, b/c it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \""no, you never served me any.\"" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. \nI don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. \nThe best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money."
"1","My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. \n\nI made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. \n\nWe arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for food/drinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. \n\nThis is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. \n\nWe decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. \n\nOur first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice."
"2","I read a few of the reviews of Mad Mex and quite a few reviewers called their food Tex Mex and I don't see it that way. I see Mad Mex as more Cali Mex with the accent being on fresh ingredients, healthy cooking, and excellent service. The black bean soup is almost fat free and the best I've ever had. (try it Joe D style with a dollop of guac on it instead of sour cream) The lime cilantro salad dressing Is amazing, I've had it on the grilled portobello mushroom salad for a meat free meal. The grilled fish tacos are every bit as good as the famous fish tacos in San Diego. The fish is grilled perfectly, plenty of home made guac, pico, and sour cream accompany this dish. The beer list is a who's who of some of the finest micro brews across the states, including many IPAs which are rotated monthly. You can watch the bartenders squeezing fresh fruits and melons for their huge line ups of margaritas flavors. This little Pittsburgh gem of a restaurant is now opening locations in other cities like Columbus and Philly. There are many locations in the Burgh."
"1","Perhaps our mistake was going on a Sat.night in the summer .Who knew it would be packed to the gills with thirsty college students. \nLoud is an understatement. We were crammed into a little table the four of us elbow to elbow with the diners seated on both sides. \nThis already has put me in a bad mood.I never did well in Europe sharing my table with stranger and in the U.S it irks me even more \nIt took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda. \nWe at last caught our waitresses eye and was told should would take care of us she guessed.....? What the heck she was the same waitress who took the drink order and was delivering the food next to us. \nWhen Ms.Wiffty finally brought our long awaited food it is totally the wrong order.We even considered asking if we could just keep it because we had waited so long, but no off she went to leave us for another 20 minutes. \nWhat we got at long last was so disappointing. \nIt tasted no better than Taco Bell anywhere in America.Think nacho grande with a side of Guacamole. First and last visit.We did notice on the bill she gave us the wrong check .It was for half the amount of food we ordered and was probably some poor guys check.We waved her over .Her reply was just leave the money on the table I'll come by and get it later................ \nSo we did."
"2","Love their spicy black bean dip and their black bean and pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough of their black bean."
"1","Not a pleasant experience.  While looking at the menu, we ordered a margarita and a draft beer.  The beer came in a bottle instead of a draft and the margarita had a terrible funky taste - almost a \""plastic chemical\"" taste.  Next we chose to have chips and dips/salsa.  We were able to choose three dips/salsas and the server brought one that was incorrect.  To his credit, he promptly corrected the error and brought the right one.\n\nNeedless to say we elected not to have dinner and departed after drinks and chips.  There is much better Mexican food and drink in the 'burgh."
"1","\""Meh.  I've experience better.\"" \n\nI find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the \""like\"" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food, and it's not something I'd think about again when I leave, but I wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  They staff is nice, when it's busy they're a little slow.  The food is spicy, like the guacamole and house salsa - I like spicy, but it didn't really add flavor, just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good, but strong w/ low-end tequila, yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  The pico de gallo, my alternative to the spicy salsa, was as bland as they come so I settled on \""virgin\"" chips.  Everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh."
"1","You have no idea how badly I WANT to like this place. They are incredibly vegetarian/vegan-friendly. I just haven't been impressed by anything I've ordered there. Even the chips and salsa aren't terribly good. I do like the bar-- they have great sangria-- but that's about it."
"1","The food here is pretty good but the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our wait just to place drink orders was almost 15 minutes, had I not been exhausted from my drive in from Columbus I probably would have left then. However we stayed the waitress was slow, forgetful we had to yell for her or wave our arms if we needed anything. At one point the poor people next to us who had also received terrible Service were asked by the waitress a full 15 minutes after she placed their order if she had gotten their orders. I probably won't visit this location again on my next Pittsburgh trip."
"1","We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. \n\nThe food was horribly hot, like they just toss in heat for heat's sake, rather than for taste. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was NOT any kind of mole I've ever had. The sauce was more like a weak, thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. Even the guacamole was too hot. \n\nI recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy \""fusion\"" of Tex-Mex and CA, but they failed. Luckily, they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so I was able to walk straight over for some Tums.\n\nIf you want GOOD Tex-Mex, go to El Campo in Monaca or El Paso Mexican Grill in Chippewa. Both restaurants are excellent examples of good Tex-Mex, similar to the styles typically served in Central California."
"2","I have always had a hit and miss experience with Mad Mex.  I love the fact that they have a great beer selection, but the food sometimes seemed expensive for the quality.  Last Saturday night the wife and I went to the Greentree location, and the food was very good.  My wife had a spicy chicken burrito, and my grilled fish tacos were fresh and full of flavor.  Of course, wouldn't you know we had a waitress that simply forgot about us.  No tea or water refill, no interest is selling me a second beer.  Oh well."
"2","Always great service at the bar from Tanya and Nikki. Great food and wide selection of draft beers. One of my favorite spots."
"2","Southwest chicken wings -cilantro- too good !"
"2","This place is hard to find in this crazy plaza, but the food makes it all worthwhile.\n\nThe Herb O'Vores Tacos are one of the most delicious things I have ever had. I've had them twice in State College and once here. I was tempted to try something new on the menu but our waitress said you can never go wrong with the tofu tacos and she is right. I didn't regret it one bit. I can always try making my own thai burrito or spicy buffalo wrap at home.\n\nYou get three tacos filled with fried cubes of tofu which have been tossed in a light sweet General Tso's type sauce topped with bean sprouts, a green salsa with avocado and served with lime wedges, rice, and black beans. So delicious and it all came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.\n\nI love reading their menu. The Mex-Asian dishes all sound awesome. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would come often to try everything.\n\nThey also have Daiya cheese and vegan cheesecake always on their menu. How sweet is that?\n\nMy only complaint is that we went just after 5 and it was so dark in the restaurant I could hardly see the menu."
"1","This afternoon I took my 4 year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class.  We had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold (even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet).  It seemed like it was yeterday's chicken.  They brought out fresh food and I'm kicking myself for having eaten it.  The rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom."
"1","The food isn't terrible, but not impressive.  I lived in LA for 4 years, so I'm super spoiled when it comes to having good Meixcan food.  We got a burrito, which was just stuffed with fillers such as rice and beans..no thanks.  There was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever.  Who seriously wants a huge burrito like that?  I'd rather have a normal sized one that actually tastes good and isn't filled with crap.  We got the steak fajitas, which were actually pretty decent.  The steak was cooked perfectly as ordered, which I appreciate.  We also got the chips with salsa and guac, which were good, but, come on, it's really not hard to mess those up!  Overall, I'm just not impressed, but I guess you can't really find that great of Mexican food options in Pittsburgh."
"1","While I LOVE Mad Mex, this one is to be avoided.  For whatever reason, they always seem to manage to mess up orders and on a couple of occassions, I've just not felt well after eating there.  Because it's a BB, I just keep thinking I had to be wrong about that.  But after waking up in the middle of the night with all sorts of unpleasant stomach issues, I've had to write this location off.  Go to Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get a new KM for this location!)"
"2","Gobble-rito!\n\nI love Mad Mex and all the offerings.   My favorites are the Wing-o-rito and Gobble-rito(when offered).\n\nThe Wing-o-rito has your beloved wing sauce mixed in their hefty burrito.\n\nThe Gobble-rito is their seasonal Thanksgiving burrito with a side of cranberry.\n\nBoth are awesome!   Schedule your training appointments or your purge because these are high-calorie affairs but worth it.   Top it off with one of their signature drinks and you cannot go wrong :)\n\nEnjoy!"
"1","I think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide, Robinson, and Ross Park. Even though it closer to my Dad's House when visiting...its time for us to part ways. The food and service is never as good at this location. I love, love, love their tofu tacos...but this was just eh this time...it was as though the thick pieces fell apart and they were small and too crunchy and maybe just old...bleh. I couldn't even finish them, even though I cannot wait to eat them the 3 times a year I get to have them. Total Bummer."
"1","I'm in from out of town, and I'm so surprised and disappointed about the level of we received here during a quiet Sunday lunch hour. Our waitress gave us indignant responses to every request, with visible eyerolls to things like sharing fajitas. \n\nWhen an order came out completely wrong, she said \""Sorry for the mixup, but I don't control the kitchen\"" and made no effort to correct the order. Had she showed any effort or contrition, the error really wouldn't have bothered me, but she actually seemed to act like it was our fault. \n\nIt really disappointed me to have my dad treated like this on our family meal together on my final day in town. Please train your staff better and treat customers with any level of appreciation or helpfulness."
"2","Would you believe me if I said that I never ate at a Mad Mex until recently? I think this once again has to do with little me's disliking of Mexican-type foods and eateries. Fortunately, adult me has much better taste than little me, which means I get to enjoy Mad Mex in all of its glory now.\n\nI've been at this location a couple times the last couple of months and it hasn't let me down yet. The first time I wanted to get in on the Gobblerito trend that half of my coworkers were enjoying during November, so I ordered that and a frozen margarita. Both were pretty darn awesome - I took half of my massive Thanksgiving burrito home and proceeded to eat nothing but that and more Thanksgiving food for the next few days. Most notable from that first visit was the fact that even though the place was hopping, the service was super quick. In fact my waitress came and asked about my drink order before I'd even opened the drink menu - it was just that quick. The kitchen had my meal ready super quickly as well and I was out the door in under a hour. Pretty darn impressive considering just how busy they were that night.\n\nSince then Mad Mex hasn't disappointed. The service hasn't been AS prompt since then but it's certainly been reasonable, and the speed in the kitchen makes up for any order delays. I practically devoured my shrimp, spinach and mushroom quesadilla during my last visit - talk about a meal with lots of my favorite ingredients! Ingredients, I must add, which were all well cooked and seasoned and mixed together in the right varieties, resulting in a well-balanced and flavorful meal. I also remain absolutely in LOVE with their variety of margaritas, which are impressively strong and delicious no matter what size drink you order.\n\nReally, my only complaint is their need to play loud background noise to \""set the mood\"" for the place - I'd never want to bring a large group here because of the soundtrack they've got going. One or two people talking to each other over that noise is enough for me. But hey, as long as they've got good food and awesome drinks, I'll keep coming back, annoying background noise or not!"
"2","I love kitchen stores, and Crate is one of the best in pittsburgh. Recently I read a few articles about the dangers of non stick cookware. None of them are really any good for any of us. I won't get into what the dangers of them are, but they are real and most non stick cookware will be off the market by 2015.\n\nI started looking into enamel coated cookware, Crate has a number of different varieties and bought myself a 3 piece starter set with an 8, 10, and 12 inch pans. Like non stick, no oils are needed and clean up is pretty quick.\n\nCrate in itself is a cooking gadget Mecca. If you love stainless steel cookware, they have anything you want from All Clad, made right in Canonsburg Pa. There's Fiesta ware from Wheeling, and If you want Emeral's professional cookware , Crate has it.\n\nYou can take cooking classes here as well, they have a full service kitchen in back. Classes are limited to certain amounts due to space, but everyone sits after and enjoys the food they've prepped. \n\nIt's top of the line cookware so it has top of the line prices. But well worth it!"
"1","I attended the sushi class on Monday night.  The instructors were great:  friendly, funny, helpful.  The class structure was good, but certainly geared toward those who have never attempted making their own sushi before.  Everyone had their own station and was able to make three different rolls.  \n\nHowever, I seriously question the value.  The course was to be two and one half hours in duration.  After approximately seventy-five minutes, we began cleaning up to go home.  It should be noted that the 75 minute class time included a 10-15 minute sales pitch of Crate's products. For $60 per person, I was beyond disappointed.  It seems unethical and deliberately misleading to advertise the length of the class and barely run 50% of the scheduled time.\n\nThe bottom line:  good instruction, but you'll feel extremely cheated at the end."
"2","Small store but the customer service is fantastic . I deal with the manager and the ladies in customer service area on a weekly basis and all have gone out of there way to help me out ."
"1","A very oddly laid out supermarket. the Deli isle is not very wide, the the walls are closing in on you, and they put the DIY olive cart in front to make it more cluttered. Just a poorly laid out store which is showing it's age."
"1","Dirty and small.  Not laid out well.  Expired items on the shelves.  Rude cashiers.  Self check out usually broken.  Horrible experience more than once.  I don't shop here unless I have to."
"1","Obviously, you aren't coming here because it is in any way cool, or because of the 80's decor. You got kids with you or others whose palette doesn't extend past burgers and fries. These limitations can be overlooked. What can't be forgiven, however, is the shabbiness of this place. It looks like it gets vacuumed once a week, and the bathrooms are disgusting."
"2","GREAT Burger ! Loaded with Flavor, and ice cold beer. I normally do not visit chain eateries , but this place was close and very good for the money.\nGood job guys !\nOHHHHHHH , Did I mention FREE COOKIES ???? \nNice Touch !"
"1","Had a beer and an appetizer, so-so.  Service was nice and quick, which is about all I need with the kids.  Kids seemed to like their kids meals, the usual Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, chicken fingers.  Huge line at Mad Mex on Friday night, none here.  I doubt we will go back, too many other choices."
"2","This is one of our go-to spots for a night out with the kids. The food and service are always dependable. This is the best Max and Erma's I've been to in PIttsburgh. Good quality American food, and free cookies on wednesday nights. Oh, and it's almost never too busy on the weekend. Great place for kids."
"1","Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server, I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied."
"1","Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!"
"1","Not up to it's previous brunch standards. Buffet has scaled back in variety and quality.   Still good but no longer excellent."
"1","There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait, Ruby Tuesdays still exists... but at least they have a salad bar... hmmm. Anyways, the only reason I keep coming back is because my husband's family LOVES to use their back room for every occasion. Ugh. Can't we just have get-togethers at someone's house like normal families do? \n\nSo since we are forced to show up for family functions I've had cause to try much of the menu, and most of it is average or below. The only thing that has been consistently good is their tortilla soup. If you're not getting that, don't bother. I've heard about free cookie Wednesday, but come on, is that really going to drum up that much business? At Eat N' Park, free cookies are a staple. Get it together Max & Erma..."
"1","Absolutely horrible service, when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence.  We were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders.  Needless to say we left, and we will not be going back."
"2","I love this Bruegger's! It's like the others in the chain so you probably either like their food or you don't. (But who doesn't like bagels?) But I find this particular Bruegger's to be exceptional. The staff is always kind and attentive, and I'm in love with their tomato caprese bagel sandwich. \n\nThey're convenient and delicious - what more can I say or ask for?"
"1","Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. \nHowever, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.\nThey Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's."
"1","Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time."
"1","Consumer alert... rats!"
"1","This Starbucks is in a strip mall at the bottom of Greentree hill and unfortunately has the unlucky fortune of being a hangout for the most obnoxious group of men who come into the store early in the morning, nurse a cup of coffee all day, take up all the chairs, and gobble up all the free samples of pastry that the baristas offer. It's really a shame too because this Starbucks has a fireplace with a nice fire working during the cold months. In the evening when the old man unemployment club leaves is a great time to visit. If not for the \""I can top that\"" club that come in everyday and tell the same old stories over and over IN SUCH LOUD VOICES, this would be one of my favorite Starbucks in the Burgh."
"2","This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there, but have you ever said hello? Have you ever asked them if you could sit down? They're totally nice guys! The baristas here are really efficient (most of the time) and super friendly. They're on top of their game and even remember regular's drink orders."
"2","So, now that the old timer glee club has abandoned this location, I can truly say that the relocation of this 'Bucks has become my favorite. Totally comfortable location, somewhat friendly associates, no fireplace anymore but I can overlook that. Lots of comfy leather chairs, you feel totally at home here. \n\nNormal coffee and tea menu, pastry case is always tempting and filled. Parking can be a hassle, but isn't that the case with any outdated strip malls in the Burgh?"
"1","I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there, like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality control,training, and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting."
"2","Panera is the best option for \""fast food\"" in my opinion. I love Panera for lunch and dinner.\n\nIt's hard to go wrong with Panera. You can eat pretty healthy here if you try. Not everything is healthy, but there definitely are options. I also like that they use fresh ingredients and antibiotic free chicken. \n\nIn my opinion, you can't go wrong with their soups, they are my favorite. Some are better for you than others like the vegetable pesto and black bean soups however, if you get a \""you pick two meal\"", you can splurge on the less healthy ones like creamy wild rice and chicken. What is a you pick two you ask? It is a meal you create by picking two items from soups, salads, sandwiches, paninis, and pastas. You get a half of each selection that you pick, which is nice to try some of their different menu items. \n\nI feel like their breakfast treats leave more to be desired and their coffee is so so. I generally wouldn't come here for breakfast. Their pastries do not have enough flavor to me, they taste rather doughy. For this reason alone is why I am giving them four stars! Other than that, they are great!"
"2","Oh, I had fun here. They just need more portapottys. It's something to do and somewhere to people watch. And the fireworks were pretty."
"2","The food and service were very good . The food is made from scratch on premises . The restaurant is owned and run by two brothers from the Green Tree area . I admire this and always try to give my business to local family run places like this . My only gripes are the limited selection at the bar and I feel the prices for food are very expensive for the portions you receive."
"1","The place looks like something from the Godfather - old school 1970 dark and gloomy wood paneling. Complete with crap brown pleather chairs and fake wood tables. The food was cooked well, but lackluster. I got veal picata which mostly had the flavor of flour and beef broth. On the plus, the staff was very nice and very attentive. \n\nManagement - you really need to update the place."
"2","When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place"
"2","Came in here just reading some reviews, figured, I'll give it a shot, they were good.\nI walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried, but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was. He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a success.\nSo, not knowing what to order, because so many things looked yummy, he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine, OMG!!! DELICIOUS!!!\nAND he prepared it himself!\nI definitely, highly, recommend dining here when in the Pittsburgh/Greentree area.\nThe reason for 4 starts not 5, the wine choices are lacking but the Red Rock Malbec was nice with the meal. \nAnd Stephanie the bartender, super sweet and makes you feel like you're a regular.\nGreat place!!!"
"2","Super fast service NY style crust pizza was great and crispy."
"1","Service wasn't very good, and their (advertised) delivery was not available (because the delivery drivers car broke down). Maybe as a sit in it would be ok but I was not impressed"
"1","Have mixed Vincent's.  My meal was good (spicy pasta) but service was spotty.  Another in the party had the homemade gnocchi and it was not good at all, \""tastes like dishwater\"", was the quote.  Naw, that couldn't happen to homemade gnocchi, after a taste, I agreed!  Just goes to show, it depends on what you order.\n\nOh yea, the parking lot, very big but some customers parked in the entrance on both sides to make it one lane and of course when we were leaving we noticed that one guy was taping his car where it had be hit."
"2","Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.\n\nSalads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).\n\nThe pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead, just get a plate of those garlic knots. They're the best thing there.\n\nAnd the comment about helpful service - when I went to pay the bill it was too windy for me to leave it out on the table. Instead I went inside and it was a no-man's land. No person working could be found for a good three minutes while I stood there with my bill in hand. I mean, what kind of place is dead empty of all wait staff, bartenders, or any person who worked there for that long during the lunch rush? Seems odd."
"1","Overpriced, very slow service, food was decent."
"1","Food is mediocre service is lousy. I'm sitting here right now and have been out of water and done eating for 20 min..."
"2","Love this place. Pizza is great and the stuffed peppers were perfect!"
"1","I went for dinner July 10.  Tight quarters inside but nice outside covered porch..Small inviting bar. Parking lot is full of potholes. It wont take much to fill with small stones but nothing has been done for years. It would be nice for customers to the fill potholes. \nFriendly staff . I ordered a Italian Hoagie and my wife had Spinach Ravoli. Waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks. My hoagie was dry with min meat. Bun was OK. My wife liked her salad. Both was very avg food in tight spaces and service could have been more attentive. Probably wont go back."
"2","I had the buffalo chicken pizza and really enjoyed it! Good quality cheese and chicken.. Hearty proportions.. No complaints !"
"2","This is a guest review from my wife Jodi, who grew up within walking distance of the Little Pink Doughnut Shop and came here often on her way to school and on weekends.\n\n\""Best doughnuts created by man.  I'm totally thinking about flapping my wings up to Pittsburgh right now at 2am to get some donuts.  Super-delicious.\n\nThey usually only have doughnuts until about 8 in the morning and they are SO DELICIOUS!  I used to get my lazy ass up at 6am to walk here and get some doughnuts, which is saying something because I like to sleep until 1pm.  I'd be like, 'Oh, it's a day ending in Y, I need to get my ass to the little pink doughnut shop.'\n\nThe doughnuts are so good I got the school bus driver to stop.  I offered to buy him one if he'd just stop long enough for me to go in, and he totally did.\n\nGo get some! Why are you still reading?\"""
"2","Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes."
"1","A while back my Mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day.  She called and mentioned something about it to them and they didn't even seem to care.  I like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed I have no use for them.  Doesn't seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open."
"1","So how can you write a review for the turnpike? Everyone hates it...and unfortunately I drive it frequently. Word of the wise...drive this road in the daytime, when it's not raining. You will thank me later for this advice...\n\nAs mentioned by others, this road is not in the best shape. It seems like every couple of miles there's construction. Not anyone working on site...but hey, you still have to slow down. Another issue...most of the roadway is 55 mph. This drives me insane...because in certain spots it's 55, and in others it's 65. Luckily I haven't had any speeding tickets here...but my warning, be aware of your speed.\n\nThe toll booth operators are ok, for the most part. You will get those with the evil attitudes. Like, I'm sorry I disturbed you...but lady you're the only one open. I'll make sure to sign up for EZ Pass so I can bypass you.\n\nAnd lastly...the price. So back when I was in college I frequented this road, from Pittsburgh to Philly and back. I believe the amount one way was between $12-15. Now...one way? Goodness I don't know the price...but let's put this in perspective. I now only drive the Pittsburgh/Breezewood route...and it's  $12.60 one way. And this isn't even the halfway point to Philly. \n\nIn theory you can bypass the turnpike by driving I-80 but this road is impassable if it's snowing. And there aren't as many rest stops. So PA knows you have no choice...and will charge you whatever on the turnpike. \n\nFYI - prices are scheduled to go up Jan 1 2015. The toll booth operators are clueless as to how much the increase will be. One toll booth operator was snippy with me when I asked her. Oh well."
"1","Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man, talk about a dead mall! Parkway Center Mall even has its own listing on www.deadmalls.com I'd only been here once or twice back in its heyday. Back then it had Chi-Chi's (where thankfully I never ate. A hepatitis scare did them in), David Weis, Pharmor, CompUsa, Syms, etc were all here. \n\nNow the mall is mainly deserted. Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle. Phantom of the Attic is alive and well and so is Pittsburgh Sports Deli. That's not an eatery either. It's a sports memorabilia store. \n\nThere wasn't much reason for me for me to linger here though.  I soon left and went over to Olive Garden for lunch."
"1","What a depressing shell of a mall... \n\nI remember when it was *the* mall to go to... CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle... \n\nHell, CompUSA, ChiChis and Pharmor don't even exist anymore... I'm not sure if Kmarts are still in business. \n\nDead malls are sad, for some reason. Walking through this mall just creepy though."
"1","Truly the worst mall in America.  Going here is like being in a time machine though.  There is a store called \""90's Nails\"" for goodness sakes.\n\nHow is this place even still standing?  For one, I'm pretty sure it's built on an old mine or dig or something.  My mom has told me you can feel the ground move when you are here.  Yikes!\n\nThe Sports Deli is actually a gem of a store though.  Man, the rent has to be so cheap!\n\nI got to give a shout out to Petland (I think that's what it is/was called) the pet store in this mall where we got our Maltese pup Sno-Flake 17 years ago!  What a great dog!  :)"
"1","Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey, I'm sure the rent is reasonable considering the land is falling apart. Calling it a mall is like calling me an athlete it simply isn't true. When you can lists off the name of the stores on your fingers and still have a few left over then you need to go somewhere else."
"1","Oy vey! Stay away, there's nothing here to see. Kmart, Phantom of the attic and a lottery place. This mall is dead! Deader than dead, dead dead!"
"1","I certainly have stayed in worse places, but they generally didn't cost $100 per night. \n\nTo be fair--the place is clean. The temperature was good. It's just small and old. The carpets are threadbare, in places. There is no restaurant, and no obvious nearby place to eat--I ended up driving around for a while before I found something. \n\nThe people who work here are very friendly, and as the previous reviewer wrote, it's got a manager's happy hour (which I arrived right before the end of), and a fitness center & pool. You have to reach the fitness center and pool by going outside, though, and in the middle of February, that's not so attractive. \n\nThe mall that is nearby is not really a mall. It's got a Giant Eagle and a KMart, but all the other businesses seem to have closed. Even the ATM was boarded up, which is really not a good sign."
"2","I'm saying this is as good as it gets. \n\nIf you're a visitor coming for a Steelers game, that doesn't need 5 star accommodations, then I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out. Two words: FREE SHUTTLE. Hell yes, free shuttle to and from the Pittsburgh Steelers game(downtown Pittsburgh Hilton, about 1 mile away). Free shuttle to and from the airport. Complimentary managers happy hour (two free drinks per person). Complementary Internet and parking. Breakfast buffet in the morning. Seriously, as a tourist on my first trip to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game this hotel made everything way to damn easy. \n\nIt isn't 5 stars for it's glitz and glamour, however the rooms are clean and I cannot stress how tremendously friendly the staff is. It isn't exactly close to the downtown area, but like I said- free shuttles will take you there and pick you up. I can't recommend this place enough for it's 'value to complimentary services' ratio. Made my trip to Pittsburgh a breeze."
"2","Easy access, plenty of parking, friendly staff, clean. A little old fashioned though but I think that's nothing to be bothered about if you just need a bed for a night. Glad they had an happy hour."
"1","The rooms are laid out weird, and for the cost the rooms are not worth it.  There are also not many place to eat around the hotel."
"1","I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask \""how is everything?\""  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say \""The microwave did an awesome job\"". I'm in town for a few days, I'm hung over and don't know where else to eat. Olive Garden is just gourmet ChefBoyArDee. You won't find me at an Olive Garden back in New Jersey!"
"1","I ordered food that I believed was gluten free.  Within twenty minutes I started to have symptoms and was sick for two days.  I believe that my food may have been gluten free but that cross contamination caused my problem.  I had the same experience at another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant and so am concluding that they may not be careful with cross contamination."
"2","Yep, it's a chain. Yep it's the but of a lot of jokes by the \""In the know\"" set.  Yep, it is kind of inexplicable how long the wait can be on weekends. Yep, I know it's more politically correct to eat at a  locally-owned family restaurant.  \n\n But you know what? \n\n I've never once had a bad meal there.  I've never once had less than top-shelf service there.  I find Olive Garden restaurants have consistently higher quality not only compared to the other franchise stores in it's price range, but also notably better than some family owned Italian restaurants I could name."
"1","Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water, the food was mushy, they charged me $3.25 for marinara sauce from A CAN (without informing us beforehand this injustice would be taking place)!  Typical big corporation: cut costs down to last nickel and inflate the prices so the CEO can fly in his private jet (after landing, eat at a REAL Italian restaurant) and purchase a new Bentley each year.  \n\nVisit DeBlasio's Restaurant for twice the portions; it is MUCH CHEAPER, as well.\n\nWorst experience at a restaurant... EVER!"
"1","Ten minute wait and easily most tables are open!!! Surprise it's lunch time!!!! I just passed six tables empty and clean. Beyond me..."
"2","This is a review for Holiday Inn Express- Greentree (April 7th).\n\nIt's the remodeled Best Western Inn. The new Holiday Inn Greentree is beautifully remodeled and closely located to all the fun in downtown.\n\nThe rooms come equipped with a microwave & fridge! BALLING! Tired of take out? There's a Giant Eagle (grocery store) in walking distance! Can you say CONVIENT! Free breakfast buffet for the guest? SAY WHAT? Think P Diddy status when you walk though the door and everyone is your Fonzworth Bentley. \n\nWhen I return back to \""the Burgh\"" I will definitely return back to this hotel!"
"2","This review if for the Holiday Inn-Greentree. I was traveling in Pittsburgh for work and picked this Holiday Inn due to it's proximity to downtown. I was not disappointed. This has been one of the better hotels I have stayed in.\n\nThe facility is very clean and the staff is very helpful. You can tell they recently renovated. Their workout facility was great, which is a nice change of pace from the majority of the hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are very spacious and have a refrigerator and microwave. This is great if you don't feel like going out to eat. There is a Giant Eagle right down the street too.\n\nThe hotel offers free wifi which has great speed and makes working from your room easy. There is a shuttle service that runs from the hotel to down town ever hour. All you have to do is ask the front desk and they will help you coordinate. They offer a free breakfast in the morning which is always great as well.\n\nThe next time I am in the Pittsburgh area I will be returning."
"2","Beautiful hotel exterior and lobby. clean, spacious rooms, lots of closet space, 24/7 fitness hours, extended pool hours 6am-11pm.   Great complimentary breakfast.  Close to tons of chain restaurants and fast food and a couple of family-owned italian restaurant (Vincent's was delicious). I loved the location, access to parking, convenience,  friendliness of the staff.  It was almost perfect! \n\n The only downside (that's why 4 instead of 5 star) is that the rooms are DARK.  I had every light on and it was still pretty dark during a cloudy day.  It probably doesn't bother most people who will just come back to their hotel to sleep.  It is not too unlike other hotel rooms but it seems TOO dark. Not enough light to read from unless you are in the bathroom."
"1","Hotel itself is adequate.  The 2 stars are for the hotel's internet connection.  I've stayed here twice in one week and both times were frustrating in terms of the Wi Fi. The connection drops numerous times in one session and connecting can be a chore. In terms of smartphones, don't even bother. My iPhone just refuses to fully connect and I've tried everything.  I stay at hotels continuously throughout the year  and this hotel has the worst internet configuration out of them all.\n\nThe staff is great and helpful but as someone who travels for business, the Wi Fi connection is crucial to my experience."
"1","This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. \n\nPersonally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy."
"1","oh. dear. lord. i feel so bad for the tour group from japan that was here .... this place is the dumps.  we had 2 rooms: they were supposed to be on the same floor.  nope. 2 different floors, took 6 rooms before we had 2 rooms that were NOT dirty.  One bed was unmade each day. Drunk frat rats.  AVOID."
"1","Place is ok but a little uncomfortable. There's water damage in some corners of the the ceiling and it looks pretty creepy. There are stains on the walls and ironing board but, overall, it's ok. The bathroom was freshly stocked, toilet and shower was clean and functional, bed seemed to be bedbug-free and is comfortable enough to lay your head at night, TV worked just fine as well. The continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster. The place is pretty much centrally located & it does have great potential..overall, it was an ok stay and I may stay again after they've completed the renovations."
"1","Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY? \n\nFirst we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room #122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really? You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs?\n\nWe go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!"
"1","This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. \n\nI'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer, but if could have given 0 stars, I would have. \n\nSo we are on our way up to room when we passed a vending machine with water underneath it. I assumed it was leaking and brushed it off. I don't care that much about little things like that especially since we were just sleeping there. After a great hockey game and a bar crawl, we came back to the hotel and got ready for bed. There was absolutely no hot water for my shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping in really quick. It was late so I let it go and decided to try again in the morning. When I woke up it was the same thing. At this point I was fuming. I NEED a shower man!\n\nSo I put on my angry pants and headed down the hall towards the elevator. Right in front of the elevator door there is a water fall pouring out of the ceiling from the third floor. \""What the hell....\"" is pretty much what I was thinking at this point. Well there was my shower considering I had to walk through it to continue on my quest. As soon as the elevator doors open to the first floor, I see the hallway is flooded. The carpet is squishing beneath my feet all the way to the front desk where other angry people had beaten me to. Apparently a pipe had burst the day before and they had neglected to tell us that when we had checked in. I was so mad. I managed to get 70% off our bill and I made her call to check us in at another hotel. I would have insisted the whole bill be paid for but I'm really bad at being mean to people. All in all, I will never stay here or any other branch of this hotel again."
"1","we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like, moldy ceilings,  musty smells, unclean rooms, and such a huge renovation job it should be shut down or discounted by 99%! thank god hotwire gave us a refund."
"1","Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. \""Lobby\"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in, given the key, room was filthy.  Saw a sticky note re: bedbugs.  Bolted, as fast as possible."
"1","I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair, the room we had was clean and comfortable. It did seem as if we had entered a time warp, though. Furnishings and bedding from the 70's...if not 60's! I've seen this place rated up to 3 stars on some websites. I'd like to know their qualifications!!\nWhen you first approach the hotel, it looks closed down. (And write obviously, it should be!!) You enter through a side entrance with hand written signs. The\""office\"" is a room right inside the doors. The hallway looks a wreck! (Oh yeah...they're under construction!!) Dirt, filth, and stains everywhere. Electrical wires exposed, smoke detectors hanging down. You look at all this and wonder how in the world are they passing codes?? (Or are they?!? Hmmmm)\nLike I said...the room was better..although not without faults. The lights over the bathroom sink did not work, and the shower did not work well. The tv was definitely a 1980's model. Wireless internet?? What a joke!! \nWhen we reported the bathroom issues, they said they would move us to another room. Since we were only staying 2 nights, we thought we would stay and just have maintenance look at it in the morning. We were informed maintenance would not be in tomorrow!! (Our ever??)\nWe told the lady working the \""front desk\"" that this hotel was pretty scary. Her reply was, \"" yeah, we get that a lot!\"""
"1","Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction? Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!\nMy family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.\nWhen we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \""Temporary Lobby\"" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.\nWe were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.\nWhen we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).\nFinding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.\nThere was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \""Gratuity Included.\"" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.\nWhen I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food. The person in front of me inquired about the gray-looking sausage-like links and was dutifully informed that they represented turkey sausage, adding, \""Because Clarion cares about your health.\"" I'm not kidding (who could make something like that up?). Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what? The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.\nIn conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day. Plus, we used our loyalty points for this room, so I couldn't even request a discount.\nBelieve me, HUD would shut this place down if it was an apartment building and the Dept. of Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, of course, you and I are welcome to pay upwards of a hundred bucks a night to stay there."
"1","This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. \n\nThe second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. \n\nThe CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. \n\nThe worst. Do not stay here."
"1","Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \""temporary lobby\"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad, but my gosh they have crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew they were under construction before we booked in June, and we were promised that the construction would be done before hand. Extremely disappointed."
"2","Boston Markets are the same anywhere, but the people who work here are great. This is my favorite one!"
"1","Junk worse than McDonald. My wife is a fan of this shop in Fairfax VA. Westopped for a quick breakfast. The poppers were stale bagels hard and the worst thing was when they heated the egg omlette in the microwave. For someone who does not use this at home, was a shock.. threw the stuff into the trash can.. the whole thing cost 25$..you decide if it was worth it"
"1","What a crock!   The thin bagel (with asparagus/mushrooms, swiss)...you get mostly cheese...it doesn't look at all like the picture on your website depicting a load of asparagus smothered in mushrooms...so full of it; definitely not worth the price. \n(this was the one in Greentree)"
"1","I stopped here yesterday morning because I was attending an off-site training session.  Typical Starbucks.  On the way back, I bought some of that new Starbucks VIA instant coffee to try at the office.  VIA does not taste like brewed coffee, so Starbucks loses one star for that."
"2","This is a decent location if you happen to be near Market Square and you're craving Starbucks. It gets crazy busy and parking can be tough since it's in a touristy location, but the lines move pretty quick as they always seem adequately staffed.\n\nUnfortunately, this location has a limited retail area. We were looking to pick up some Verismo pods and they didn't carry any the last time we were there. Odd."
"1","Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But, if you hate your job, don't take it out on the loyal customers! Your life sucks, we get it, but you have ONE job at Starbucks, so do it right. It's not hard."
"1","Came here for a \""quick\"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater, and regretted the decision immensely.\n\nExtremely long lines, and poorly trained staff. As a former employee, I know about staff roles and approximately how long it should take to receive your drink. This staff was not trained at all, and it was clear that they were overwhelmed with the crowd. It took me 32 minutes for me to receive my order (there were 7 customers in front of me), and my order was incorrect. I ordered a small coffee, medium latte, a croissant and a sausage breakfast sandwich. I know that the sausage sandwiches heat up for about 40 seconds in oven, so I can't comprehend why it took so long to get my order. Would never come here again. I also received a WARM cheese danish instead of my croissant. First, the warm, creamy colored goo in the middle is extremely unappetizing, and second, they looked so dejected when I pointed out that I ordered a croissant I almost just left.\n\nDo not recommend."
"1","Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied.  The baristas are not friendly.  I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously?  i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?)  and they're just rude.  Just.... rude.  I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people.  I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards.  Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right!  I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad.  real bad.  not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee.  No no.  You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area?  Yeah, it's like that.  Only with no febreze.  \n\nTo sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn.  Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.  WHOA.. mind. blown."
"1","MARKET SQUARE.....The slowest, most inaccurate Starbucks that I've ever seen....how can you write an order on a cup and still get it wrong....I saw 3 wrong orders (including mine) in the 25 minutes that I spent waiting...I was 4th in a line of 10"
"1","I wish someone had written a review for this place so that I would have not gone to it.  As a matter of background, I am originally from Los Angeles and have experienced some EXCELLENT nail salons there for much cheaper prices.  I don't know why manicures and pedicures are so expensive in Pittsburgh, but that's really a different path that I rather not venture into.  Anyway, this place is really small and they hardly have any nail polish choices.  It costs $15 for a manicure and $30 for a pedicure.  If you decide to go here, take my advice and take your own nail polish.  As for me, I picked out an OPI nail polish and they poured acetone in the nail polish to make it thinner!! I hate it when they do this, I guess its just their way of being cheap and not taking out a new nail polish.  The end result is that there are bubbles now on my nails and less than 24 hours later I just noticed that one of my nails has already chipped.  To make matters worse, their hot water was not working properly so they gave me my manicure and pedicure with pure COLD water.  The only positive thing I found about this place is that they accept credit cards."
"1","regarding Shari's review: when i went they wouldnt even accept my debit card .  she was an older woman who i do not think knew how to use the machine so i ended up going across the street to pnc and using the atm.  it is not top quality work, they def over charge for the level of work they do...maybe that's bc their rent is high in downtown? it is about average price for nails though so doesnt hurt the pocket...but there are alot of places that do better for the same price.  its a convenient location so i would go back if i needed a last minute job, but def not my first, second, or third choice."
"1","I should've believed what was already written but It was close to my hotel. The WORST mani/pedi of my life. I'm 43. I'm a flight attendant. I've been to a LOT of nail salons. I swear she wasn't licensed. She had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for 40 years. She clearly needs to retire and the male owner was an a$$. He says \""not everyone does it the same.\"" Well..... They certainly should come close!! No cuticle push back. Didn't know how to remove gel polish. Didn't file straight or smooth. Didn't clean under my nails after lotion. I had to tell her to take alcohol to my nails to clean off lotion and remind her to use a base coat. Then she polished all over my cuticle. 17 hours later having done nothing but sleep workout and shower the polish is chipped off 6 nails."
"1","I guess this will be my last good review for Princess nails. Unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened. I have one eyebrow! Its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me. \n\nUnfortunately I don't know what happened? Michelle are you going blind? Are you okay? Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried, I weeped, i found myself in the fetal position. I'm no longer going back. \n\nI know some people have off days but this was BAD."
"1","By far the worst Shellac manicure I have ever had. I went down on my lunch break for a quick mani. First the woman rushed through my \""manicure.\"" I'm not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer. The manicure was very quick and not at all thorough. Once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush. She took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the UV dryer. When she went to put the top coat on my Shellac she put the Foundation coat on 2 of my nails before she realized and wouldn't fix them saying they will be fine. During the entire process she did about 6 eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process. She also kept forgetting to turn on the UV dryer to the point where she walked away and I had to turn it on.\n\nDo not go here. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
"2","My stylist, Lacy, moved here from another salon, and I followed her.  She's great, and I wasn't about to give up on her just because she moved to a nicer salon that happens to be substantially cheaper than the old place.  For a review of Lacy, please see my review of L'Azur Salon.\n\nThe salon itself is really nice - they have a fantastic view, and lots of nice touches.  You can have coffee or tea (and cookies), and they have a nice locker system so you don't have to lug your purse to and from the styling stations.  Everything seems really clean and open, and the clientele seem younger and hipper than some of the other salons I've been to.\n\nAdd the bulldog that roams around, and you've got a super great experience.  They only do hair, and a tip for the new - take the elevator to get into the salon.  I like walking, and took the stairs, which actually does not lead into the salon.  They use Bumble and bumble products, but are not super pushy about it.  The receptionist could use a little bit of an attitude adjustment - I swear she sighed and rolled her eyes at me when I said I didn't want my receipt."
"2","I just moved to Pittsburgh and used Yelp to pick MCN Salon. The reviews nailed it. This place is great! Why? Let me count the reasons:\n\nMy stylist is Kara and woo-ee is she fab. Not only did she give me a great cut (I had wayyyy long hair and wanted to get something lighter, without losing too much length--I'm getting married in months) but she is wicked bubbly and fun and great to chat with. At my first visit we talked about my hair, what issues I have, and she promised to research various solutions to provide me with awesome hair. She's very open about trying different things (e.g., perhaps a multivitamin--work from the inside out--to fix hair, rather than slathering on lots of product) and really seems to care about getting it right. Go to Kara!\n\nThe rest of the staff are equally friendly and fun. The salon definitely has a hip, young vibe, without making my (somewhat) unhip self feel awkward. Great open space, very clean, no chemical stinks, lockers for your purse, coffee/tea/water, tons of magazines, and a phenomenal view of East Liberty. Just a chill place. Add a friendly bulldog and it can't be beat.\n\nAll in all, I have to thank Yelp for absolutely pointing me in the right direction! If you're looking for a great salon with reasonable prices and friendly folks, MCN will be a perfect fit!\n\nPS. Definitely take the elevator--you actually have to. Stairs only go to the 2nd floor, and MCN is on the 3rd."
"1","I got a good haircut here a few months ago, so this one-star review is not intended for the stylists.  It is a response to a strict no-returns policy on salon products, which makes me pretty mad: I couldn't have known they recommended the wrong product without trying it, and now that I tried it, they won't refund my purchase.  Catch-22.  I came in to buy a replacement for my normal bumble and bumble curl creme for thick hair, and was told by the receptionist that bumble and bumble's \""defining creme for fine curls\"" is the new packaging of that product (which seemed weird to begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different and it doesn't work for me.  I used it twice, figured that out, and now I'm stuck with an expensive product I can't use. I called bumble and bumble and they told me that the product I use has been discontinued.  All my previous salons in other cities would have honored a return in this situation.  I won't be back to MCN."
"1","I, too, decided on MCN based on Yelp reviews after moving to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I did not have the great experience others did. I ended up getting probably the worst haircut I'd had in 10 years. It ended up a good 4 inches shorter than I discussed with the stylist. In addition, she took the fact that I work in a professional office to mean that I wanted an ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost a year to grow back to the length it was before. I admittedly should have complained then and there, but I'm a wuss. \n\nAdditionally, the experience at the salon left much to be desired. I went in the late morning on a weekday. There was a little girl there (around 3 or 4) with her nanny. Apparently her mom was a regular customer. The little girl was getting a haircut and she cried and screamed for 25 minutes. I know kids will be kids, and I don't blame the little girl for being scared or cranky. I do blame the salon for not finding a way for the girl not to disrupt the entire salon - taking her to a back room, taking her outside to calm down, not allowing children in an adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache.\n\nI will not be back here, but it seems like others had great experiences."
"1","The salon is nice, and the people were great, but I was not impressed. The haircut was mediocre, but the highlights were much worse. They didn't even cover up all of my roots! I don't know much about hair, but the place I went before I moved always made great suggestions and chose highlights that were perfectly suited for my skin color and for the season. MCN failed to do this in a big way."
"2","Being new to the city, I went into panic about finding a new hair stylist. SF and Boston have plenty of reviews to choose from but Pittsburgh didn't have many, let alone stellar reviews on salons. At the time I colored my hair so I didn't want to let just anyone put foils and scissors near my head. Finding a new hairstylist is like a game of russian roulette to me. I can either be safe or be really screwed for a few weeks.\n\nMCN was really the only salon ranked high in a search in my neighborhood so I gambled and scheduled an appointment with Sara. The salon is located near a Whole Foods, Starbucks, Walgreens and what use to be a Borders. It is clean, spacious and open with nice views overlooking the city.\n\nSara did a great job and continues to do so (I'm loyal like that). She consults me first and doesn't deviate from what we agree upon. Her demeanor is professional and friendly. While I was waiting for my color to process, MCN has some outlets for you to plug in your computer to pass the time.\n\nReasonably priced and another nice thing is that MCN occasionally will give free goodies as a thank you or for the holidays. While certainly the do is most important, the little things count as well. I will say though that they do seem a little pushy with product and the product may not even be the best one for your hair. I know salons can make a great profit off of product from the show Tabitha's Salon but this can ruin your experience at MCN after an awesome haircut/color treatment."
"2","I went to M.C.N salon because I had seen positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say the reviews were right. It was one of the best salon experiences I've ever had. The salon itself is beautiful and very inviting. The receptionist was so warm and genuinely friendly. I recently changed stylists for something new which I was wary of  doing.  I decided to try one of their junior stylists, Elizabeth. Everyone should go to see her! She gives a great first impression which is reassuring because nothing makes me more nervous than a stylist who is not put together or whose haircut and/or color is whack. \n\n I came in a hot mess and I left feeling and looking a 100% better. My hair is really thick and was driving me crazy in the heat. She did a great job thinning it out and giving me layers without sacrificing length. My head literally felt lighter. Plus, the blow out she gave me was so glamorous. I've never seen my hair look like that before! She was really patient and explained the products and how she was styling my hair. I would recommend her to anyone. She's really professional and great at her job!"
"1","So...I was sold on MCN Salon about a year ago, and found it through Yelp reviews.  I really was sold at one point.  It's clean.  It's up-scale.  It's hip.  It's pretty.\nBut after my last haircut, I'm going to suck it up, and make the 45 minute drive back to my old stylist in Peters Township.\nBasically - I just feel like they're trying to up-sell you the entire time on products and more services.  For example, if I wanted my eyebrows colored, I probably would have added that to my appointment.\nTheir stylists are GREAT, don't get me wrong, but I just don't feel like I'm being pampered or focused on when I'm there.  The last time, my stylist was working on 3 different people while I was getting a cut and color.  Therefore, that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair.  The time before that, the stylist was working on 2 different people.  I have no problem with that - I just don't know who to tip at the end because I feel like my main stylist, actually did very little in the long run.  \nPlus - I told my stylist on our very first visit - \""I don't want to think about my hair.  YOU are the STYLIST!  YOU are the DESIGNER!  Every time I come in here, I will want a different hair cut, but I want YOU to do it.  You will NEVER hear me say, 'just trim it up and do like we did last time'.  So please, I trust you to just make me look HOT.\""\nWell - the whole past year that I have gone there, I have sadly just been given the same haircut all 4 times.  I HATE THAT!  I'm not a hair stylist.  I know most people are stuck in their old ways and never like to change their hair; however, I am not.  I LOVE getting new hair cuts.  I love going from long to short...or from short to growing it out.  I like change - especially with the seasons!  Give me some edge!  Make me look sexy!   (I never feel this way leaving this salon).\nPlus, every time I have gone for a cut and color, I feel like it has gotten more expensive every single time.  I don't know what I'm being charged for...but my first session was a little under $120.  This past time it was up to $175 and like I said, I only go for a cut and color.  So I don't understand why my appointment is $55 more than it was 6 weeks before (and 6 weeks before I actually bought PRODUCT!).\nAfter 4 sessions, I can now say that I'll CANT WAIT to be going back to Stephan Szabo's in Peters!  That's worth the drive, the price, the experience, and the feeling of newness and pretty confidence!"
"2","Excellent Salon.  I went to Kara for curly hair as Nicolette was not available (this was my first visit:  I recently moved to PGH and used these Yelp reviews to help me pick).  She was perfect:  friendly, professional, and gave me the exact cut and color that I asked for.  It was just as I'd imagined it, only better because it was on my head!  And she KNOWS curly hair -- how to cut it, manage it, style it.  It is rare for me to feel so confident in a stylist. Absolutely worth it.  No complaints at all. Thank you Yelp!"
"2","Brent is good.  Like reviewers prior, it isn't cheap.  And you will get upsold.  But that's part of the deal, I think, when you go to a salon like this.  Best thing about salon is the location on the third floor.  Color was done well, cut was ok.  Probably won't go back because I have found cheaper salons that do a better job since going to MCN."
"2","Newly relocated to Pittsburgh's east end from Miami, I wasn't sure where to turn for my hair.   I was nervous about finding talent, especially since my last few hair appointments in a new city had been less than stellar experiences. I was worried I would never find another stylist on par with the super star I had in Miami.  I couldn't let worry prolong the inevitable, however, with grey starting to peek out and ends beginning to split,  so  I did what anyone would do by asking around, reading reviews online and praying.   Upon leaving MCN Salon with my hair cut and colored to perfection, I can tell you my prayers were answered.  After reading other positive reviews about Sarah here on Yelp, I decided to book with her.   Although, I have a long, classic hair, I watched her work on a variety of other clients while my color was processing.   Her vision and talent seemed limitless as I watched her style a young child to a very punk rock female and an older more traditional man. It was very cool to watch her use her talent to shape each individual's cut to their preferred style and preference, which is what we all hope for in the chair but don't always get.   And, she does all of this for a phenomenal price.    I had full color, hair cut and blow out for $130 and was blown away.  I don't remember the last time I left a salon with the complete package for less than $200.\n\nFrom the check-in to consultation to payment and yes, rebooking I had an exceptional experience.  If you are looking for a salon and stylist in Pittsburgh, look no further than MCN Salon and Sarah!"
"2","My stylist (Abbey) definitely knows how to do my hair exactly in the manner that I want. Everyone at MCN are really nice and friendly. It may be a bit pricey, but for a good haircut wouldn't you pay a good price too?"
"1","Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color.."
"2","Just tried MCN salon for the first time this week and had an amazing experience there. the stylist (Jesse) sat me down and assessed my hair, and told me her honest opinion about what she thought it needed and the best kind of cut for me. It was perfect! I'm so happy someone finally took the time to actually give my hair a good look and tell me what it needed. I will definitely be going back!"
"2","This is actually my second time at MCN, but I had stellar experiences both times. My first cut was with Sara and my second with Heather. \n\nI'm pretty particular about the way my hair is cut because I've had the same style for years now and know how I want it cut so that it grows out well. What's great about MCN is that the stylists make sure to talk to you in depth about your cut before picking up the scissors, and are great about pausing at certain points in the cut to make sure that you're happy with the way it's going. I really appreciate that, and have had great experiences with both stylists. At this point, I'm really confident in going to MCN and getting a great cut, and will definitely go back."
"2","I'm in search for the best stylist when it comes to curly hair. \n\nHere's is where I met the charming Kara last week, with whom I had a great consultation. I explained that I needed a haircut that was intended for curly hair, with layers and not so symmetrical. I wanted a cut while the hair was dry but I let her do what was best for her, knowing that most stylist don't work this way. So she cut my hair wet, dried it and finished while it was dry. I got a cut that's a bit too short (that's the problem with cutting curly hair while wet - it \""shrinks\"" once it dries) but I really like it!\n\nThe hair salon is very trendy. It was busy at the time I showed, one weekday afternoon. Two bulldogs came in after being walked and hang out at the back of the salon. I'm assuming they're the owner's dogs. \nHairdryers hung on of the mirrored walls. Very nice staff, specially at the reception area where they had beverages and pastries."
"2","I really enjoyed the amazing environment at MCN.  Cookies and water with fruit infusion at the entrance - and a kind, sweet receptionist to introduce me to the place set the perfect tone.  The receptionist is new so it sounds like the owners are actually listening to the complaints regarding the previous staff in this area.\n\nMy appt with Lacey was great.  I talked with her about color options and products to make my curly hair tame and straight.  She gave great suggestions and my blow out was definitely runway pretty.  \n\nA few things though - price is definitely even more steep than Capristo.  Unfortunately, though my hair looked amazing, it definitely took her a lot longer to blow me out and I have grown accustomed to Kim's speedy blowouts at Capristo.\n\nIn conclusion, the ambiance is WAY better at mcn and I am def considering returning if I still can't achieve the ombre color I want with Kim.  The place is so darn cute that I will probably still pop in every now and then for a blow out."
"2","I have finally found my forever salon!! I love this place! Great service, educated stylists regardless of what level they are.  The owner is so nice and is truly concerned with each client in the salon.  I would recommend this place over any other salon in the area!  Margeaux my stylist was great, she took the time to get to know me, found out what I like and provided great insight.  I love the color and cut!! It maybe a bit pricey, but very worth it, if you are a fan of amazing service and work!"
"1","I mean...seriously? \nI should have known better given that it only had one positive review. My 600th yelp review, you think I'd've learned by now!\nI wandered in here looking for a pedicure. My first hint should have been the old crusty polishes on the walls - no Essie etc here. But whatever, I picked out my color and headed to the dilapidated pedicure chair. (I put my bag on the adjacent tray and it couldn't support the weight). They don't use razors here, which is fine, but I expected a thorough scrubbing of my callouses, and when she gave me a tiny little once over then unceremoniously threw my feet back into the water I thought to myself, OK there's no way on earth this is more than a $10 pedicure right? My heels still looked as bad as they did when I walked in. \nThen she painted my nails and sat me down at the \""dryer\"" which consisted of two tiny fans pointed at my feet. For real. I had to sit there for over ten minutes, she proclaimed my toes dry, then I paid - $25?!!!! For $25 in Boston where I'm from I could get a legit pedicure. I was dumbfounded. I paid, walked home, and lo and behold two of my toes already had smudged polish. ARGH!"
"1","I have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and I just had to write. I walked in to Kenny's nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasn't a wait. They also provided very friendly customer service.\n\nHowever, my manicure looks terrible! It looks like I painted my nails myself, only even I could do better. The paint and clear gel is all over the underside of my nails and baked on, no less. I'm even finding paint on my fingers now. The nail technician, a female, didn't even touch my cuticles, but she did use an electric file to shave down the nail bed. I guess that's supposed to count for the cuticles? No frills, no hand massage, not even any moisturizer or cuticle oil or anything.\n\nI am horrified I was charged $25 and then I even tipped 20%. Now I'm wishing I would have asked them to start over, perhaps with a different nail technician. I won't be going back, however. At least I was in and out in 25 minutes. But what a terrible job."
"1","They suck!! First of all not even 24 hours after I got acrylics one broke, then they painted on the french white tips which is fine, however they did such a poor job. When I came back to ask for a refund they were very rude about it and refused to help. I have gotten my nails done almost for a year and I have never seen such a poor job. DO NOT GO HERE."
"1","The worst experience ever. I have never complained about my nails bc im pretty laid back but this was insane. The man that was doing my nails had an incredibly shaky hands, cut me more times than I can count, and have the nails literally one and a half times the size of my nail beds. I got pink and white and the white was not uniform among any of the nails and usually wasn't even uniform from one side of the nail to the other . . On 1 of my nails the white was 3 eights of an inch on 1 side and 1 eighth on the other. The equipment to scrub the nails was unsanitary and in a dirty cup. I have never had such a negative experience anywhere and I kept trying to explain what was wrong to the man and he just wouldn't listen. He did not smooth down any of the nails until the third time I complained about it. I spent $85 at the salon and have to go and get them redone by a different technician tomorrow because I don't even trust them to redo their mistakes"
"2","Did you ever go somewhere and eat something and think, \""Alright, this is good, I'm not blown away, but alright...\""  \n\nOk, then, did you ever realize, that months later, you're still thinking about something you ate there?  And then you start to think, \""Hey, maybe that was better than ok, since I'm still thinking about it...\""\n\nIt's kind of like a movie that you're luke warm on, until you realize that you're still thinking about the movie two days later, and then you're like, \""Actually, I guess the movie was better than I thought, because I'm still thinking about it two days later.\""   \n\nYeah, this place is kind of like that.  We went there back in October.  We had just driven about 6 hours from Jersey to Pittsburgh, we got in kind of late and hungry, and decided to get something to eat here because it was so close to our hotel (and I did not want to get back in the car and drive somewhere.) \n\nThey had a good drink special (a couple of dollars for a margarita), and we got sandwiches and burgers.  Nothing amazing, but they hit the spot.  But, here's the part I'm still thinking about... they had a special that included the option of sweet potato tater tots.   Sweet Potato... Tater Tots.  Is that redundant?  Should it be Sweet Tater Tots?  I don't know, but I do know they were willing to substitute them with my sandwich even though I wasn't getting the special.  And I do know they were goood.  \n\nSo, now I'm a 6 hour drive away, it's two months later, and I'm still thinking about those Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  And, for that, I'm giving this place 4 stars.  \n\nSoHo is really close to PNC Park, and not too far from Heinz Field.  They also deliver (\""room service\"") to the two hotels right there, Spring Hill Suites and Residence Inn.  Ask for the sweet potato tater tots.\n\nAs for me, I'm left wondering if sweet potato french fries (the more common menu cousin of the Sweet Potato Tater Tot) can ever truly be an adequate substitute, or if I need to go out and buy myself some sweet potatoes and try to tot them myself..."
"1","SoHo clearly relies on the Pirates crowd across the street, and Steelers and Pitt games. When there's a game, the place is packed. Other times, it doesn't seem so busy. The food has been OK. It's generally bar food, with an effort to be more. Execution is varied. \n\nTry the seasoned tuna sandwich with a side of parmesan risotto; just tell them how you want the tuna cooked because they don't seem to know and will overcook it."
"1","A number of the reviews here giving off the \""eh\"" vibe? That's because Soho is a kind of \""eh\"" place.\n\nI visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: \""These two things should never be on a menu together.\"" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.\n\nI would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all."
"2","My family and I stopped by here for a quick dinner before the Pirates game. Since it was a game day, they were offering a limited menu that boiled down to typical bar food. Sandwiches, wings, etc. But, WOW...what bar food it was!\n\nThe burgers were amazing. My dad got a steak salad that was delicious. I think my mother was able to get some sort of pasta dish that she really enjoyed as well.\n\nGood food, at a fair price. I will be back the next time I am in the 'burgh for a game. :)"
"2","Stopped in for lunch before a Bucs game. Great service and food.  Hamburger was thick and juicy cooked perfectly.  Service is excellent.  I can highly recommend SoHo as your pre Bucco stop."
"2","A nice selection of drinks (reasonably priced for Downtown Pittsburgh + next to a stadium) and the menu was easy to follow with plenty of variety. \n\nFood was well cooked and fresh ingredients - it was worth sitting outside!"
"1","My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey."
"2","Spicy BLT was excellent! Jalape\u00f1o Bacon and Basil Mayo...don't get me wrong, this isn't a high end establishment but that was a damn good sandwich. Friend with me was not impressed with the Filet Medallions on Bruschetta but the desserts were good and my BLT was GREAT!"
"1","We we're not impressed. The prices are high for what is bar food with no real uptake.\n\nService was neutral both visits (stayed in attached hotel).\n\nWould be willing to grab a cocktail but definitely better options around."
"1","I'm staying at the hotel at which the soho is located and I thought it would be a convenient place to eat dinner. Well, it was overpriced and the food was terrible. I ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. The pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy, the chicken was overdone (dry), and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. Very bad food and overpriced. Not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. She then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word, though I met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. She was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)\n\nTry another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel, there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....Atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff. \n\nhttp://www.atrias.com/"
"1","I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch."
"1","Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were."
"1","Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded, so we sat at the bar, even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. We were just 4, but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. It was also very loud for a weekday, the noise from other tables carrying easily.\n\nI ordered the french dip sandwich, with risotto on the side. To their credit, the risotto was delicious, but such a tiny portion, I inhaled it in no time. Especially considering the french dip was so boring. The meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. Not to mention, the food is definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, but if I did, I'd order the risotto and nothing else."
"1","Bar next to stadium\nTypical\nbar next to stadium place\nWaitresses def looking for other jobs \nNot happy at all\nThis isn't even a game night"
"2","I love it here.  Great game day event location.  Great meeting.  Huge bar.  Huge selection.  Not just bar food.  So you will enjoy a dinner.   If you have the munchies it will hit the spot.   Ok do let's do it.  Have some fun."
"1","No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza, mac & cheese bites, and spinach & artichoke dip.  It was hardly edible. Stay away."
"1","Meh. \n\nI always hope for the best. I did not, however get the best. Although I would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer wasn't bad. But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss. \n\nI do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing. \n\nThey have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me. \n\nI went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here."
"1","Had the chicken sandwich,  my sister had the guiltless chicken. 30 minutes after ordering, our waitress came over to ask again what we had ordered because she had forgot to put the order in. Food was flavorless, plain. Was there a few nights ago for drinks after the game, waiter wouldnt allow 3 of us to sit at a 4 top table (but had a party of 1 sitting at a 4 top right next to the table we were going to sit at). Do they even have tables for 3?? 15 minutes later... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there. Overall, its a close spot to PNC but given both experiences, wouldnt return."
"1","Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, no mashed potatoes, no asparagus as ordered. So, Check your order. I mean for a 2 person $50 meal with tip I would hope the waitstaff would deliver on what was ordered & asked before we left. \n\nBut skip the 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs."
"2","This place was a nice venue. The wait ayah was friendly and inciting and my food was tremendously delicious. I'd recommend it to anyone. Only complaint was the amount of time to be seated"
"2","LUNCH:  This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived and worked in Pittsburgh. I was a creature of habit though - - for lunch I very seldom strayed from their wonderful lobster bisque and a nice mixed green salad. It was the perfect lunch. Served quickly, which gave me plenty of time for the nice walk to and from work.\n\nDINNER: For dinner, when I had more time, it was always nice to venture into one of their other great seafood offerings. They have a couple of great salmon dishes that I really like and a striped bass. All seafood is fresh and prepared with care. Chicken and steak, but I never tried them - -  too many good seafood choices. Very nice presentations.\n\nSUSHI: They have an extensive sushi menu - for those of you who are big sushi fans. Me?  Not so. But I have friends who are and they rave about the sushi here. \n\nOne of the things I like best about this place is that the menu includes info on where your dinner was born, raised and caught.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FISHES\nThey exclusively serve Lummi Island Salmon\nhttp://www.lummiislandwild.com \n\nTilapia, NC\nLouisiana Catfish, LA\nAtlantic Salmon\nRainbow Trout, ID \n \nWILD LINE CAUGHT FISH\nDayboat Fluke, NJ\nLummi Island Salmon, BC \nTombo, HI\nWaluu, HI\nShutome Swordfish, HI\nStriped Bass, NJ\nPintado, Brasil \nChilean Sea bass\n#1 Ahi Tuna, HI\nMahi Mahi, C.R.\nWild Sea Scallops, MA\nDiver Scallops, Baja \n7 oz. Lobster Tail, SA\n \nFor an inland seafood restaurant this one rivals many costal ones I've eaten at. Definitely an upscale, pleasant place to eat lunch or dinner. Great service, quiet relaxed atmosphere. \n\nYes, it is a little pricey. If you want cheap fried seafood, head on over to Long John Silvers or Captain D's. But I bet you can't get them to tell you where their seafood came from . . . even if they know!  And, even if they do, you probably don't want to know!\n\nYou get what you pay for - in both food & service."
"2","From March 2013 visit: the food was much better, good enough that I want to return. I had salmon, quinoa, spinach, pesto, bread (that's all I remember). I'm upgrading to 4 stars.\n\nFrom Aug. 2009: The most disappointing thing about this place is the temperature: uncomfortably cold.  Probably 60 degrees (on a warm day in August!).  The whole dining area was cold; it wasn't just our table.  When we brought it to the attention of the waiter he said there's nothing they can do about it; it's the hotel's cooling system.  That's insane!  Don't they care about the comfort of their customers?\n\nThe food was good, but the waiter did a poor job: he got one order correct, but they botched Jo's fish dish (she asked for the rice pilaf without tomato, and they brought her the standard rice pilaf with tomato), and they botched my order (I didn't order the prix fixe dinner, but they charged me for it (at a cost of $7 more), even though I communicated my order clearly."
"1","I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here."
"1","For a place that has a $75 entree I was pretty shocked to see a $2 charge for blue cheese olives on my bill... pretty tacky.   That was definitely a first.  I was disappointed the waitress didn't say anything either. Aside from that the service was pretty good... and the sashimi was a great value.  But everything else about this place is shwag.  The seared tuna - garbage, rainbow roll and Caesar salad - weak,  and the sides incredibly small.  The place has the feel of a riverboat buffet.  If this was stand alone they would only get away with charging 40% of what they are now... in the Westin.\nI would skip it, or if you have to, get sashimi at the bar and make sure you review your bill."
"1","Having read positive things about OFM lately, I thought we'd give it another try as it's been years since we've eaten there.  Unfortunately, our experience was dreadful.\n\nI knew going in that the food was overpriced.  Always has been.  But not only can you get less expensive fish/seafood elsewhere, but you also can get FRESHER food at other places.  Our food tasted frozen and overcooked.  \n\nWhat has NOT changed is the extremely poor service.  If you don't look wealthy or if you're not buying multiples rounds of alcohol, the wait staff avoids you.  And that was our experience the other night.  \n\nHow can restaurants get away with poor service and bland food at such high prices?  I guess OFM lives off the travelers and not the locals."
"1","Serviceable \""upscale\"" chain seafood spot, with both traditional dishes and sushi.  Yes, it's expensive, but it's one of the few spots open late downtown.   The sashimi was pleasant, and it's hard to screw up oysters and seafood pasta.   Our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations.\n\nThe service is on par with your local crap-on-the-wall chain restaurant, so don't expect too much."
"1","One in our party summed it all up:  \""When you're paying these prices, you should expect better service.\""\n\nThe food was good.  I had a sashimi platter with some additional pieces, which was perfectly average.  You can get the same thing around the corner at Sushi Kim...and I think the quality is a bit better and the price lower.\n\nAnother in our party had the rib eye.  It was cooked well and he liked it.  For dessert the cheesecake was good, although the blueberries were clearly from frozen (unacceptable in July when they're in season).\n\nI had to sit and wait 5 minutes after my food was brought out before I could flag down a server to ask for some chopsticks and soy sauce.\n\nIt's not that the servers aren't working...it's that they're spread too thin.  Understaffed.  All working hard, but covering too many tables.\n\nLong story short, I won't go back.  Walk over one block and go to Eleven!  Same price, better food and service."
"1","- The bread was good and so was the spicy shrimp butter that came with it.\n- The lobster bisque had a very slight gummy texture to it, as if too much flour had been used.  \n- I had the lobster pasta and I was a little disappointed with the lack of sauce that accompanied it.  It was really more of a broth than anything, which made the pasta seem too soggy and also drippy and messy to eat.  My wife had the fillet mignon, which she said was one of the best she's ever had.  She thought the potato side was just so-so.\n- Each of us had a drink with our meal, which put our total at $115, including the tip.  I expect to be a little bit more wowed with a meal for that price."
"1","Hotel restaurants are just awful!  It's like you have to be mediocre to have a restaurant inside a hotel.  I don't get it!  Wouldn't they WANT you to stay and spend money on their property?? \n\nNevertheless, this place in the Westin hotel is no different.  For starters, the place is sorely outdated.  The decorations look like they're straight out of an 80's music video.  I went with my mom, who asked me if the glass sculptures on the ceiling where Chihuly's.  I almost choked on my bread when she asked! \n\nI always go for sushi when it's on the menu at a fish place.  I can't get away from it, plus I need my weekly (or sometimes daily) fill of it!  So I ordered a spicy yellow tail roll and a ginger salad.  The spicy yellow tail was not spicy.  It had a side of \""spicy\"" sauce.  I'm not too sure that qualifies it to be spicy with a dab of sauce.  The salad's ginger dressing was awful and watery.  I love ginger dressing when it's done right.  But it was not happening at this place! \n\nThe thing that really made me mad is that the place is overpriced to begin with.  My tiny yellow tail roll was more expensive ($7) than the fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls.  And DEF not as good!  My mom ordered a bowl of fish soup.  This \""bowl\"" was a deep dish salad bowl and looked as if there was a small ladle size serving.  It was hardly halfway full.  That's all my mom had ordered for lunch.  It was pretty sad looking.  So she asked for a little more from the server.  The server said that's all she could give her because it was restaurant policy.  Now let me tell you....I've worked at restaurants.  I've witnessed the people who eat their ENTIRE meal, then say it was bad and want another one...and they get another one!  Now that's messed up!  Asking for a little more soup, that's supposed to be a BOWL but looks more like a spoonful is hardly too much to ask for. \n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be back. There are WAY better fish places in the city to fill my belly with, hands down! Go to Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened a new location right on Fifth Ave! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
"1","Terrible.\n\nI visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  \n\nFirst, lets talk about the decor.  Others have commented about the outdated 80s look of the place. I concur.  The chairs are ridiculously heavy and uncomfortable.  And don't even get me started on the hideous glass constructions hanging from the ceiling.  \n\nSecond, let talk about the staff.  Unprofessional to say the least.  When we were waiting for our table, I witnessed the hostess yell at a man from across the restaurant, instead of walking up to him and guiding him to his party.  \""Hey Anthony, your party's over here!\""  Ridiculous. \n\nThis restaurant has an open kitchen, which is usually a good thing - but not when everyone's yelling at each other.  We were seated near the kitchen and, I'm not exaggerating, heard someone yell \""order!\"" approximately every 30 seconds.  Staff yelled at each other from across the restaurant constantly.  I felt like I was on a playground.  \n\nOur waitress was a nice, sweet girl, and she did the best she could considering the environment she was in.  I have no complaints about her.  \n\nThe food, though... Jesus.  We started with the \""margarita shrimp cocktail\"".  Imagine tiny round pieces of popcorn shrimp floating in a glass of lime flavored water.  These were served with tortilla chips, which you'd think were meant to be used to scoop up the shrimp from the glass.  But, the shrimp are solid round balls, not a scoopable salsa.  We tried picking up the shrimp with the chips, but they'd just roll off and end up on the floor.  My date and I just laughed as we TRIED to eat this concoction.  When it finally made it into our mouths, it was gross anyway.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a sushi/sashimi combo platter.  I'm being generous by giving it a rating of mediocre.  Take out sushi from a grocery store is better.  \n\nNow, I admit, I made the mistake here - I ordered the fried fish platter.  I'm used to getting a variety at seafood restaurants.  At a place like Mitchell's Fish Market, you can get a dish with a piece of fish, a few scallops, a few shrimp, and a vegetable.  The Original Fish Market has no such dish.  The only dish I could get that had more than just one piece of fish with some plain steamed white rice and steamed spinach, was the fried fish platter.  So, I ordered that, with a side of green beans (vegetables were $5 - $7 extra).\n\nThe description said I would get a piece of tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, and french fries.  I didn't realize this meant that the tilapia was fried, the scallops were fried, the oysters were fried, and the shrimp was fried, all on top of a giant bed of fried french fries.  It's just not what I pictured.  Like I said, it was my mistake for not reading carefully and not asking the waitress, but lets say for argument's sake that this is what I wanted.  \n\nIt was still disgusting.  The batter/flavor was exactly the same for everything.  The scallops tasted like the french fries.  The shrimp tasted like the french fries, the tilapia tasted like the french fries.  I didn't even try the oysters, but I'm pretty sure they would have tasted like french fries.  I ate barely a quarter of this dish, and I'm pretty sure I consumed an entire week's worth of saturated fat.  If you ate this entire plate, I think a heart attack would interrupt your dessert.\n\nThe green beans were good. \n\nOther people commented that you can't count on hotel restaurants being worthwhile.  I have to agree.  If everyone's just passing through, you don't have to worry about actually impressing anyone and getting them to come back.  And with business travelers, they're usually paying with their company's dime, so they don't bother to complain or expect much.\n\nI have learned my lesson.  I'm not coming back.  And I seriously question the sanity of people who gave this place more than two stars."
"1","I have eaten there several times.  This is an overpriced overhyped seafood restaurant.  The portions are not worth the price.  The Sushi is average at best.  The service has been poor almost every time I went.  We complained once to the manager and in the middle of talking to her she picked up the phone and totally forgot she was talking to us.  \n\nThe salads are small and nothing to write about.  The decor needs to be updated. If you ask me why I keep going back; it's not by my choice.  Usually we have several people staying at the Westin."
"1","Came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service. Finally went searching for someone, who only came back with our order after we had nearly given up. And refills on water, coffee or soda? Forget about it."
"1","Pittsburgh has good food.  Don't waste your time at the Fish Market.\n\nI stay in the Westin often and have had three meals at this spot in the past week.  The first was fine enough to get me to come back for a second trip.  The second time, our waitress clearly was in no hurry to serve our three-person group in the 50% occupied restaurant.  The third time, the chef's special \""coriander-crusted fluke\"" came out as a couple slabs of tasteless fish coated in bread crumbs and oil and tossed onto a pile of dry couscous, and they served me the wrong salad.\n\nService: most of the staff here don't seem to respond well to ordinary social cues.  For instance, standing at the podium for two minutes probably means I want to be seated, not looked at and ignored by two different waitresses.  Or, when I go to the bar to order takeout, after I submit my order and wait for the server to tell me the wait time, I don't expect him to leave me and start washing dishes.  \n\nI may stay at the Westin, but I will exert extra effort to NOT eat there."
"1","I have never had such awful, inedible food at such an appallingly ridiculous price. It's not only a failure in execution, the plates are very poorly put together, and the flavors of the sides and sauces with the protein do not marry well at all. I was severely disappointed by plating, and then just got mad when I started eating.\nYou would think for 44$ your steak would at least be properly cooked. What was supposed to be medium, came raw. The steak was tough and tasteless. \nAhi tuna, asked rare, was overcooked; also bland, even with the sauce. The oshinko side was laughable. Seriously. I laughed. \n\n pasta was overcooked, and by the time it got to us, the sauce was laminated with coagulating fat. \nThe sushi was an amatuer attempt at best.  There was too much rice, and presentation was sad. \nAmbience is tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half the room and framed sketches of fish plaster the other half.\nService was the only redeeming quality. \nTo put it in perspective, my neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next to this place."
"1","We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple \""Sorry for the wait\"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color, but that was it.  Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market.  I was generous to give one star."
"1","My experience may different from others because I am an attractive female who went in with 3 young African American males.  Good friends of mine who spent a helluva a lot of money in Pittsburgh that weekend - who work hard and expect good service for good money like everyone else.  We were greeted with reserved distant service.  The waiter said something nervously like \""It's all good,\"" or something that people don't even say anymore.  A round of Patron Margaritas were horrible.  They tasted entirely like sour mix and we couldn't even take more than two sips.  Of course, when we ask that they be taken away and replaced with shots of Patron, we were got the \""oh, you're that type,\"" look and it took a while to convince the waiter that there was sincerely something wrong with the drinks.  Being used to that look, black folks often stomach bad food just to not appear to be complainers, but these drinks were horrible!  \n\nSo in the spirit of good faith, we ordered the some appetizers. Shrimp cocktail, crab bisque, and two oyster samplers.  The soup was bland, shrimp were large, but had a wierd texture that didn't seem fresh or like they'd been scrubbed to hide something, and oysters were not evenly sampled on both orders. One appeared to contain mostly one type instead of the 8-9 different types.  We plunked down the $200 for the appetizers and drinks with a nice tip and said ciao - went and had dinner at Sonoma - which was much better... Fish Market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity OR new management."
"1","Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans, was thick and chili-like. The rest of the lunch was so unnoteworthy, I can't remember what I ordered, though almost all of it was still on the plate at the end of lunch.  I do remember the bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day."
"1","Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had, including McDonald's and 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners.\n\nPittsburgh is undergoing a bit of a food renaissance, yet the Original Fish Market continues to put out an inferior product in a horrendous atmosphere at an obscene price.  \n\nOur fish was tasteless and rubbery, my white wine came out at room temperature, the restaurant was extremely dirty, and our server was clearly apathetic.  \n\nThe Original Fish Market opened in 1998, and quickly found a place in the market in a city where Red Lobster was still considered \""good seafood\"".  As top-notch restaurants entered the market, the local palates grew up in a big way.  The Original Fish Market seems content to remain frozen in time competing as a mediocre option in an under served market space.  Unfortunately for them, their market space is now flooded with options offering a far superior product  at a fraction of the price."
"1","I went for lunch last week.  The food was awful.  Do not waste your money at this restaurant."
"1","One of the only places open downtown after 10 pm mid-week. Terrible service, average and overpriced food, in a hotel lobby, doesn't make a good combo."
"1","Seriously, terrible.  Just all around terrible.\n\nWe've been to the OFM twice now... the first visit was acceptable, but the second was absolutely terrible.  We had late reservations for a quick bite after a lovely night at the O'Reilly to celebrate my husband's birthday.  As sushi lovers, we thought this would be a great way to end the celebration.  We sat at the sushi bar and couldn't get the attention of our waitress or the sushi chef.  After an exhausting 20+ min wait in our seats and just as I was about to go find someone, we finally were able to place our order.  \n\nAgain... waiting, waiting.  Oh, our wait was enhanced by guests of the hotel (tweens loaded with makeup from what appeared to be dance competition and their drunk parents) standing behind us. No, they were not eating, they were just standing there... yelling, at 11pm.  \n\n\nOur server returned to bring my husband's glass of warm white wine and commented on how terrible our experience must be, but did nothing to help... no drink refills, no offer to call the manager, nothing.   Hubby sent the 14$ glass of bath water, I mean, wine, back to the bar, only to have it replaced with, you guessed it! another glass of warm white wine.  \n\nOur sushi was finally ready and it was edible but not enjoyable...  no flavor in the fish and hard rice.  We left before finishing our 40$ meal (1 glass of wine, 1 water, 1 roll, 2 orders of sashimi).  \n\nI almost asked for the manager, but frankly was tired of waiting and just wanted to get out of there.  To top it off, we paid $12 for valet parking that would not be validated unless we spent $50 at the restaurant.  We will not give it another chance and suggest you don't give it a first."
"1","This place really should be much higher quality for first the prices and second the only food option at the Westin.  I stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food.  The wine that I ordered was out (which was fine) and substituted - but for a place with a giant wine cellar I wouldn't suspect that should be an issue for the glass wines.\n\nWhen I went to order I asked the server how the scallops were - and asked her to be honest.  She said that they are the most well done in Pittsburgh.  Well I think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate.  I was a little bummed about my experience when the 55 dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of wine.\n\nAlso a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10K watt surgical spotlight.  It actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright.  That should be an easy adjustment for the management.  Food quality on the other hand - you need a new chef."
"1","I've been meaning to go back to the Fish Market for so long. I remember the great crab legs I had years ago. I finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed.\n\nThe service was great. We sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. I guess my main concern was the food quality. I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.\n\nI do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And, with all due respect to owners, I think the atmosphere needs a serious update in character and aesthetics. Especially since other key hotels are more pleasing to the eye. This should be vital to one of the BEST hotels in the city! \n\nI'd like to return someday to give it another go. We shall see.\n\nP.S. Invest in better wine glasses. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly."
"2","I read the reviews here and still decided to try it out. It's SUPER close to work and I was craving some miso soup. I am really glad I didn't let the reviews stop me. I thought that they had pretty descent Sushi. The city of Pittsburgh isn't exactly a mecca of Japanese cuisine, but I think it's VERY comparable to other places throughout the area. I got the OFM roll and it was extremely fresh and really delicious. I totally recommend!"
"1","I was pretty disappointed by this experience. And I usually avoid hotel restaurants for this very reason, but I was tired and I was staying at the Westin, so here I am at the Original Fish Market...\n\nI sat at the bar and ordered dinner. The bartender was very friendly and made sure she was taking care of me. So props to her! I got a menu and a sushi menu. OK, I'm pretty sure Pittsburg isn't the most awesome place for sushi, but let's give it a shot! I started with the gumbo, which came out warm and kind of bland. It wasn't good at all. And then I had a roll, which was decent. And a spicy scallop roll. Now, everyone has their own take on spicy scallop, but this was by far the furthest from what I could imagine a spicy scallop roll could be. \n\nIt was a small roll cut into 6 pieces (maki). It had a very small amount of raw scallops, which didn't taste super fresh. Then the roll was topped with the \""spicy\"". I can't identify exactly the spices that were on top, but I've had this type of spice combination on other Japanese dishes. So I know it's an off the shelf thing. Basically, this was the worst roll I could imagine.\n\nSo all-in-all, the food was sub-par at best. And the entire menu was overpriced. I would definitely eat somewhere else if I had any energy at all. I'm sure the room service would have been better."
"2","just went for drinks.  Seemed nice.  Good happy hour"
"1","Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me, the Original Fish Market fits that description.  I met my mom and dad here for a pre-concert (Bonnie Raitt) dinner and honestly I wish we'd gone someplace else.  \n\nTo be fair there wasn't anything particularly wrong with the food or service.  I've enjoyed seafood restaurants before and while my dinner was okay, it was only just \""okay\"".  There wasn't anything particularly memorable about it.  Nothing that made me say, \""Wow\""!  My parents didn't hate their dinners either but they weren't impressed.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.  The Original Fish Market wants to be a swanky hotel restaurant.  It certainly sets its prices high enough ($25.00-$45.00 per entree).  But the quality just doesn't match the price."
"1","First time I've eaten here I went during lunch time. Not crowded but service was quite slow so I took off a star. My girlfriend ordered from their sushi lunch special and I ordered the bison burger. You're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. Well I originally planned on fish but I hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon, but none showed up. No worries probably better for me. I felt at $15 for a bison burger this thing should freaking be awesome. Not the case. I would put it at $8.99-$9.99 price range I would pay since they gave me chips as a side. So they lost another star for over priced for the value I received. The girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu. Two basic rolls and miso soup for $16. This would easy go for $14 at other places during lunch. So ultimately would I give it another shot? Yes, but only if it is convenient. I would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place.  \n\nHelpful advice for the OFM.  Actually have lunch specials. If you charge the prices you charge the food needs to be worth the price or you will lose return customers. Two rolls of sushi and a burger shouldn't cost me $33 unless you are going to blow minds!"
"2","Had awesome service and pretty excellent sushi. They have these lettuce wraps which are to die for! Highly suggest them."
"2","I come here perhaps twice a week for the past few months. The lobster bisque and salmon are great. Apart from that, try their salmon and tuna sashimi. If you're at the sushi bar, you're in and out with a wholesome meal within half an hour which is great when you're travelling for work and need a quick meal"
"1","I've been to the Fish Market many, many times over the last 18 years or so. It doesn't change much. They get maximum money for average seafood (or anything else). \n\nThe sushi wasn't great this last trip (last week), and didn't taste terribly fresh. The Miso soup was barely average. I did like the Tataki roll, but it was the only saving grace of the meal. \n\nOverly expensive for what you get, and service can range between average and terrible. \n\nOh, and the bartender that's been there for as long as I've been going is seriously crappy, and I'm amazed he's lasted so long - is that a union gig?"
"1","McCormick & Schmick's knockoff is the best way to describe this completely non-memorable place. \n\nI agree with the other person who said \""it's trying to be a swanky hotel bar/restaurant\"". That may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels & their restaurants it can easily go either way. I've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. \n\nI hope for Pittsburgh this is not the case. Did I expect more from a Westin? Yes. Am I surprised? No.\n\nSub-par sushi. Tasted like takeout from Wegmans (holler, Rochester!). My Sauv Blanc was room temp & obviously an old bottle because it tasted nothing like it should (Kim Crawford is my standby so this was extra disappointing). Walk across the street & check out the Tonic Bar, I wish I had."
"1","Stopped in for lunch. No greeter so we weren't sure where to go. Super expensive for the portions. My salad had dressing only in the center. The rest was dry. My sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish  weird. But the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. It was disgusting. The waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. She however did not offer to comp the meal. I would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. Way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-("
"2","In the lobby of the Westin. Service was friendly and exact. Good was excellent, especially since I thought it would be a mediocre \""hotel lunch\"" at best. Scallops with potatoes and corn hash and some lovely mushrooms as well. Cajun shrimp butter was fantastic too!"
"1","Not good. I suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin b/c the service sucked. The food was ok, but nothing special. It's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent."
"1","We checked this out for lunch, since we were staying at the Weston.\n\nThe sushi, I thought, was pretty good.  Nothing outstanding, and I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but it wasn't bad.  My friends ordered other things off the menu; the verdict was largely that the food looked good, but was bland; this was especially apparently true of the fish sandwich.\n\nThe attached bar is *small* with a very limited selection of beers and liquors.  Perplexingly, they also have loads of bar seating, but don't open that area for happy hour time.  It seems you could not get appetizers and hang out until some point later in the evening.\n\nSuper expensive too.  Go somewhere else for lunch, there are many better options in the area."
"2","I try to go here for lunch at least once a week. I believe it is the best lunch spot in the strip if not Pittsburgh. It's so good that it actually makes me smile thinking about it. I get the smoked salmon salad or the spicy thai wrap. I keep telling myself to branch out but they're such perfect lunches. Their cookies are delicious too. And the lady at the cash register is really nice! Absolute A+"
"1","Went here on a Monday at around 7:00.  The bar was filled with the usual suspects; guys in Brioni suits drinking away the stress, unfortunate weather and reality they have to head home to the wives who just dropped 3-5k at pottery barn.\n\nThe drinks were solid, and very fair priced (based on NY and Chicago pricing)  The open(ish) floor plan would accommodate a happy hour very well.  The food on the other hand - absolutely horrible.\n\nWe had lamb, chili prawns, ahi, chicken (something) and Chorizo.  The 'fusion' southern Spain meets some Japanese influenced small plates works, but the execution was deplorable.  \n\nVerdict: Drink but avoid the food at all costs..."
"1","SO disappointed with this place! I've been wanting to try it for some time and finally did and boy...what a letdown. I had heard that it was one of downtown's happening Happy Hour places, but on the Tuesday night I went, it was 99% empty. The menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average. The drinks weren't anything special either.  No innovation here in the food, drinks, or decor."
"2","Cavernous and huge floor plan.   The location of Bossa Nova is perfect if you're downtown - either coming from or going to a show at Heinz Hall or walking across the Alleghany over the Clemente bridge to go to a game.  The place is handy if you're with a large group.  The timing was probably bad - the Monday nite of Thanksgiving week at 8 pm but there was no more than a 4 or so tables going off.   I fear that BN may not be long for this world.  However, the price was right  for me and my girl - 4 glasses of wine and two trays of tapas (the Chef's cheese platter and the veal & pork meatballs for $50)!  Agree with another reviewer that the servings were generous and tasty.  What was missing?  Lack of a mood or beat in the place.  And, the server who took care of us - she did a good job but she seemed bummed out as if waiting on us was a chore.  If not for the lack of ambiance and the somewhat feckless service, no problem assigning this place 5 stars.  I think we just hit it on an off nite."
"2","It's always surprising to me when you go to a bar/nightclub/restaurant and they actually have good food! It DOESN'T surprise me when most of those food and drink items are pricey, so they better be worth it! \n\nCocktails were STA-RONG. My caipirinha was really wicked strong and my Cosmo was pretty much cranberry juice with a splash of vodka. Looking to party, here you go!  Looking to dance...meet me in the middle of the wide dance floor to drop to some pretty excellent DJ tunes.  It's nice that there's wide windows that open up in the summer that people can gawk at you dropping it from the street!\n\nI like that there's actually a business downtown that stays open past 9 pm! You'd be surprised the crowd you get here on any night of the week. Thursdays are salsa night and Friday/Saturday you get a mix up the after theater crowd and the night owls. Throw in a random Steeler (hi Charlie Batch) or Pens sighting and you've got a hip place! I love how the place is decorated like a Mad Mex restaurant that's ready to throw down on the dance floor! \n\nAlthough you will always have your creepers....case in point last night. A strange man claiming to work at Saks went around kissing our hands. But who doesn't come out of a bar without a creeper story. It just adds more flavor to the place...or a good story to tell the day after!"
"1","Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving, all the good seating near the windows was blocked off for private use (and remained unused). The \""host\"" told us to go find our own seating wherever we wanted. The setup is interesting with a large open bar area and a small number of tables around the perimeter. We took a seat at a table. The bar seating was fairly full with some milling around in the area and standing, and probably a total of 30 people there. We saw at least 5-6 staff, a couple sitting around playing on their phones.\n\nWe sat at our table for 20 minutes and never had a single person come by, not to say we will be there shortly, not to take a drink order, nothing. We could tell this wasn't going to be good so left and no one even noticed.\n\nIt was a little more bar than restaurant, so we weren't sad to leave."
"1","Girls looking for a sugar daddy, guys looking for a cougar, or if you're just a pretentious douche: Bossa Nova is the place for you.\n\nThe atmosphere is downright tragic for how hard it tries.  The bar prices scream to the proletariat: \""Let them drink beer down the street! We only want the bourgeois in here.\""  Even the DJ they had during the Gallery Crawl a few weeks back was tragic.  I mean I know that the DJ has to appease the sugar daddies and cougars but is every place in Pittsburgh required to have 80s music?  I'm sure it is in the liquor license application.\n\nThat said, the barstaff is generally friendly and very quick - most likely so you don't realize you just paid eight dollars for a beer."
"1","I never ate here nor could have possibly gotten a drink no one would wait on me.\n\nMy friend who wanted to be a socialite of some kind asked me to come with her. I don't know what she was thinking. Not my scene whatsoever! We had come from a free Devo concert. I was dressed in converses,  a side pony tale, and bright pink 80's garb. \n\nI have never seen so many idiots occupying one space. The chicks looked at me like I was an alien. Not everyone needs to wear 5 inch heels, gobs of makeup, and clothes that is so tight that your breathing is impaired just to get a little cleavage popping out of a minuscule ugly dress.\n\n I like fashion, I love heals. It was the glassy, vapid, duplicates that I saw that made me give my friends a hug and kiss then seriously BOLT out the door! Super bad energy in this place. I jumped in the first cab I saw and headed to Lawrenceville. I didn't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there. Smoke bomb disappeared! She knew I would hate it but just didn't want to go alone. I was pissed.\n\nThe night was not lost. My awesome \""fiends\"" from LA (stunt man Curtze, and Elvis impersonator slash gangster screen writer) met me out and we dive bar-ed the rest of the evening away. I meant to write \""friends\"" but didn't change it because fiends, haha... much more appropriate. \n\nI am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort. Some of my favorite people like Bossa Nova. Just stating my personal experience."
"1","This rating is for the drinks only and atomosphere, and based on my personal taste a bit ok  a big bit. This is definately a \""I'm a young professional pittsburgh business person and I've arrived.\"" Status bar or \""I'm a young college girl and I've just had my first boob job care to help fund my nose job too?\"" Bar , I did not try the food becaused I moved from a place where we have awesome brazilian restaurant where fresh meats melt in your mouth accompanied by tart sweet grilled pineapple, and real slow cooked brazilian beans mmmm. Soooo after seeing how pittsburgh does Mexican food I'm not willing to drop my pennies to risk the disapointment of pittsbugh attmepts brasilian. \n\nThe bar is roomy with nice lounge seating which is nice for those who don't want to participate in the round the bar meat market. The guys make for fun people watching, either all suits or in their pirates jerseys. Or the occaisional jersey shore look a like meat heat in his v neck t shirt who is too good to attempt so much as a toe tap to the beat of the music. Then there's the balding old man with twenty something on his arm who already looks like she has botoxed up her face in an attempt to mirror her idol kim k. There are few older gay gentlemen I would have liked to chat with who mad things a little more interesting. There was an awesome looking woody Allen meets Andy Warhol look a like with cool glasses, and an awesome white frizzy mane.\n\nThe women range from down to earth girlfriends in for chat, drink and dance to wifes and girlfriends grinding it up on the dance floor with their man to the cougars. Warning Cougar dance zone, these women looked decent though and I'll give it to em they weren't afraid to shake it. \n\nMy biggest gripe about this place (I know I haven't gotten there yet), the drinks are sugary syrup crap. You can only put too many sugary alcohols together before you get a tummyache, you might as well be drinking the syrup flavors starbucks puts in your coffee. Stick to something on the rocks or a vodka soda most places cannot screw that up too badly (aside from Bar louie) but I will get to them later. Price is lame also 8 bucks and up for a mojito and they use coconut rum in it! Yuck. Sorry my college days of only being able to handle coconut rum are over, it is was frat guys give girls with a roofie.\n\nAnyway moving on my biggest gripe was that there is a cop standing by the door, who looks like he just walked away from beating a non white person to death. I know I know cops have the hardest job and I will be the first to say it, but this guy has a thick energy so nasty it hits you in the face from across the room. The way he was looking at the non white people who were a little to \""loud\"" for his tastes, no louder than the booming music mind you. Made my stomach churn. Also they used him to close at 1:15am on a saturday. Thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed. Bars in Salt Lake City Utah do that, come on BossaNova this is pittsburgh aka  drinkersville, not mormondryville. Just sayin...."
"1","Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay, that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly, nor timely with the direction.'    That said, we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point, we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out, there was still not one bit of attention given, again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said \""thanks for your business\"" .....or lack, there of."
"1","I've been going to this bar randomly over the last 5 years. It's definitely gone downhill.\nMy last experience here was when I was trying to plan a birthday party during happy hour on a Friday during the summer. When I called to reserve some space, they told me they only reserve seating areas for people who pre-purchase food. Which, the pre-purchase options were about $10-12/person. I wasn't about to pre-order food for a casual birthday get together. So, figuring they'd probly be very busy on a Friday night, we got there around 4:30. There were MAYBE 6 people around the bar. No one in the lounge seating area. I sort of felt undervalued as a customer for not being able to reserve space when no one was there. 5:30 came around, the bar got a little busier, but no where near the packed house crowd they painted as a picture for me when I tried making reservations.\nOur waiter was sub par. People sat without drinks for 20+ minutes, and some people just didn't get to order, because one person would order a drink and the waiter dashed off, leaving others to call out after him (to no avail.) He would basicalyl take 1-2 orders, and run off, not to return for 10 minutes. \n\nThis place is average in food price and quality. But the attitude of this place could be better. Go to Six Penn instead. They have outstanding service without the pompous attitude, and in the summer they have a roof top patio with a bar and lots of seating. Best in town!"
"2","Go to salsa night on Thursdays super FUN"
"1","The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces, so the gave us ketchup to go with over cooked shrimp/bacon and extremely greasy fries."
"1","I live very close so I decided to have a light dinner and drinks before the salsa crowd was wheeled in.  I noprmally google a menu before my visit to have an idea of the cuisine.  I sat at the bar and ordered wine.  (stemless glasses, huge turn off, but there are trendsetters, and everyone else).  The actual menu was the menu online chopped in half. (There were only about 6 items on the actual menu).  I chose the shrimp skewers.  I was literally the only person at the bar outside the staff, that consisted of 5 20somethings eating humus and crackers and a 40something with a cheap french press dolling out samples to the others.  I was served the spicy shrimp and offered no water, or receptacle for said shrimp's tails.  Bad service!  I was LITERALLY THE ONLY PERSON at the bar.  My wine glass remained empty for at least 10 minutes before my server found a loll in her humus eating gabfest to see if the one customer may need something.  After I finished the second glass, I managed to flag down one of the all black outfitted staff who was still eating something with her finger as she went back behind the bar to ask for a check.  \nI've been to BOSSA NOVA many time before, and I understand the short service when a the bar is beyond capacity, but again, I was the only person at the bar.  There were some people seated at tables, but the bar, just me.  \nSo if you are looking for wannabe pretensious night club full of party goers that can't remember what going out looks like, than you've found it.  If you want, good food, good music, and a fun atmosphere, then run over the valet at bossa nova on your way to anywhere else!"
"1","First impression:\nThe guys here were borderline rude to me when I dropped my car off. I thought I had talked to someone on the phone and made an arrangements. It turns out there are two Monro Muffler locations on Penn Ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then, or at any point), as I had called the wrong location (I found out days later).\n\nService:\nThey took my car in anyway and said \""they'd get to it tomorrow\"", well tomorrow became the next day and the day after... \n\nGot a call that the mufflers I bought for the car turned out to be the wrong ones so I called around, tracked down the right ones, and dropped the correct ones off there within two hours of the call.\n\nQuality of work:\nAll in all it took a week for them to get the work done and I was under the impression they would be welding the whole system together. It turns out they just use clamps and bolt stuff together. I asked them to make me some tail pipes for me with bends over the rear axle and they couldn't do it with 2.5\"" pipe, turns out they are incapable of bending anything over 2\"" pipes there. Instead we agreed it would be easiest for them and cheapest to install short turndown pipes. So really it wasn't a terribly difficult job to be done.\n\nOverall impression:\nI gave two stars instead of one because they didn't actually break anything or lose my car or burn it down or anything. Pricing came in just over what we had agreed on because of the addition of the turndown pipes. I could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself."
"2","This is a gret place to go if you like Martini's!  The food is pretty good and the decor is awesome!  There are always some randoms bartending and you're never sure if you'll get a hipster or old mother Hubbard, but they always serve great drinks!"
"2","Olive or Twist, a narrow bar tucked away in the Cultural District, has friendly service, reasonable prices, and pretty decent bar food.  While it's not a sports bar per se, it's a great place to watch a game... like Game 7 of the Stanley Cup.  Go Pens!!\n\nIf they renovated their bathrooms, they would definitely deserve a five-star rating."
"2","We came downtown on a Sunday afternon before a show looking for cocktails, seemingly this was the only place open on a Sunday. Olive of Twist is very dark, but it makes for a nice date spot. They found a way to make exposed brick walls and large indsutrial fans classy.\n\nTheir cocktails are absolutely great, at the top of the list is a proper gin martini with an olive or twist. They may also make the best sidecars in Pittsburgh, but for $8 - $10 a drink you should expect as much.\n\nThe calmari was excellent and we'll keep them in mind for their extensive dessert menu."
"1","Don't bother. \n\nWe were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place, with the low lighting and witty name (although we weren't sure if they're cleaver enough to make the theater reference or if it was simply a mistake).\n\nThey boast a new menu and I got the pasta with goat cheese and almonds. I didn't have high expectations but this was like family meal before your serving shift. It was boring and flavor free. My boyfriend got a steak sandwich that looked punny. Oh, and the grocery store wine was way over priced.\n\nBoo!"
"2","Love the atmosphere and martini menu here. Nothing like a Frosted Grape martini and exposed brick to make you feel like a class act. I've also enjoyed any sandwich or salad I've ever gotten here. Highly recommeded!"
"2","Nice surprise.\n\nExpecting bar food when looking for a quick dinner while in town on business from Florida, we were presently surprised by the variety and quality at a reasonable price. The Buffalo Chicken spread was a flavorful hummus fare served with pita bites that were wonderful while warm. I had the Ahi Tuna Taco Platter that was tasty as well. The house Merlot was short of the $9/glass price, but overall this was time and money well spent."
"2","Friday night girls night out and we were on the town. Olive or Twist located near the cultural district right across from the theater was the place to be. It is mostly the young professional crowd. The decor is brick with lounge couches upstairs, welcoming you to grab a martini and have a seat while searching eyes as people go by.\n\nI can't say this is a south side meat market vibe but the young are here to mix and meet. This particular night we were full of giggles and playful flirtations. There was some kind of CMU business men event going on and within a minute the bar was packed with young eligible bachelors in suits. Way too dressy for my taste but it was fun to talk and check people out. Everyone was friendly and from my perch on the bar it seemed everyone had mixed drinks in hand so I joined in with my signature dirty martini. It was made just right. The ambiance and music was light. I was having a good time and an even better time when offered drinks and striking up conversation. I didn't get to sample the food because we had already eaten but I will def be back. This place would be ideal for a date night. Stay tuned..."
"2","Sooo blacked out here that\nWe heckled the guitarist.\nNot sorry. He sucked."
"1","I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all."
"1","I get it. It gets busy when you're a bartender/waitress sometimes. I've been there myself. But you can explain why things are late or why it takes nearly half an hour to pour a glass of wine without being incredibly rude and cold, and if you even say it with an apologetic smile, most customers will understand. Food was fine, won't go back for fear of the server."
"2","Bossa Nova's step-sister bar, but not the evil jealous step sister more like the older a little more mature caring step-sister. At least in the way of making a carefully crafted unique martini or cocktail. \n\nAtmosphere is a little more cramped, but usually you can still find a table late on a week or weekend night if you do not mind sitting in the back. It is fine for me because I don't like being sandwiched at the bar with other people's conversations in my face. \n\nI didn't try the food but my friend ordered the Tuna appetizer and she said she loved it just wished the portions were a little better. But for the price it wasn't bad. \n\nI ordered the Perfect Pear cocktail with Pear Absolute Eldleweiss flower liqouer and a splash of pineapple juice it was delicious! Not too sweet and I despise sweet drinks. The perfect blend of soft tangy tartness. Much more creative then the drink menu at Bossa Nova.\n\nFor the drop in spot after a show or just happy hour with friends I found this to be a pretty down to earth and decent spot. The waitress was not that great but she was young, some things are forgiven if the product is just right."
"2","Came here for drinks and appetizers while in Pittsburgh for the weekend. They have a lot of specialty martinis to choose from. I tried a few including the sparkling pomegranate and tiramisu - both really good. For appetizers, we shared the calamari and buffalo chicken dip. The calamari was served with some kind of teriyaki sauce which gave it lots of flavor - delicious. I liked how the buffalo chicken dip was served in a martini glass - it was good but nothing special. \n\nI thought the service was good.. we sat in the dining area and had someone waiting on us the entire time. We walked by the bar on our way out - it was crowded with several groups of people standing around the bar. I'm glad we were at a table."
"1","The genius of the \""Olive or Twist\"" name got us in the door here, but we didn't have the best experience with their mixers.\n\nWhile here, we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini.  The blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum. As a strong drink, it was good. However, the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink. For the cucumber basil martini, the basil is the primary flavor in the drink and kills any undertones of the cucumber. The sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing.\n\nIn addition to a cocktail menu, they also offer a reasonable selection of beers including microbrews."
"2","Found you on Yelp and weren't disappointed. Very friendly waitstaff and good food (bar fare). Yummy desserts. The acoustics downstairs were terrible. Exposed brick everywhere and no noise dampening.  Not the best place for an intimate dinner or quiet conversation on the weekend. But a young, fun, party like atmosphere. Convenient to cultural district."
"1","I ... don't know why I keep going back to Olive or Twist. Seriously, you could check my Foursquare stats and see that I've been to this bar more frequently than any place I've ever called my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. \n\nWhy? I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. \n\nI tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. \n\nNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move ... ). \n\nOlive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy and/or Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself. Just keep those expectations low."
"2","Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day."
"1","In town on business and I always try to find places like this.  Wow, a martini bar not named the Blue Martini?  OK, I'm in!\n\nSo I strolled over and walked in.  First impression was it was a cool, cozy, and trendy joint.  Liked the exposed brick walls, lighting, etc.  Only problem is, I don't go to a restaurant or a bar to eat and drink the atmosphere!\n\nSo I grab a table in the bar.  It was about 5pm and there might have been 15 people in the whole place.  Two bartenders made eye contact with me so I figured they would be waiting on me.  I figured wrong.  I sat there for a good ten minutes and was getting ready to get up and leave when the younger tender came over and said with a \""deer in the headlights look\"", do you want a drink or something????  Well hell, what was your first guess?  I refrained from quoting Foxworthy and saying \""here's your sign\""!\n\nSo OK we were off to a bumpy start.  I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.  I was just here for a bite, so my review is based on that.\n\nA few minutes later the other bartender comes back with my water and gives me a menu.  I ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side.  I say \""some\"" turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive!  \n\nIt seemed to take forever for it to arrive.  Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive.  When it did, it looked OK.  The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.  The wrap just had zero flavor and was loaded with lettuce........way to much.  The only flavor that presented itself was blandness!  It was very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I think this is probably a way better bar to have a drink in then a restaurant.  I will return to try a martini, but I will pass on the food."
"2","The cocktail menu options were mouth-watering. Great place to grab a drink with friends, especially on ladies' night out!"
"1","We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants, but this place looked nice.  The atmosphere was nice, and if I was rating only for atmosphere I'd give it 4 stars.  However, I'm mainly rating their food and service.  We were greeted promptly, but after that the service was spotty and it took awhile to receive our drinks/food even though there weren't many people in the dining room.  \n\nI ordered the Traditional French Dip Sandwich and Fries.  I enjoy a good French Dip and have tried many of them at all types of restaurants and this one was the worst I've ever eaten. In fact, I couldn't finish it.  The meat tasted like old lunch meat and the bread was nothing more than a cheap, glorified hot dog roll that was soggy.  It wasn't soggy from the Au Jus, but it tasted like they steamed the roll for some reason.  \n\nOverall, if I was going back to Pittsburgh in this area, I would stay far away from Olive or Twist."
"2","I'm reviewing Olive Or Twist strictly as a weekday lunch person.  I haven't had drinks there, or been there during an evening or weekend rush.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  Its seating area is small - maybe seven or eight tables?  The lunch menu is delicious.  I get the grilled cheese and tomato soup every time, and it's perfect.  The friend I go with gets the French Dip and sings its praises all day long.\n\nThe prices are a bit on the high side - over $10 for lunch - but frankly, the food is so good I'm glad to pay the extra couple of dollars.  \n\nThe bartender is always the same guy when I go, and if he's the only one up front who has to seat me I get a distinctly unhappy vibe off him.  Killing him with kindness does not work.  Other than him, the staff seems great, and I'm happy to give them my business."
"1","I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. \n\nI tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. \n\nFor reasons I truly can't explain, we decided to stay for a beer before heading to our destination. We both threw down a brew nasty, paid and left. Unfortunately for Olive or Twist, the visit would probably be our last.\n\nOn a positive note, there was an interesting man setting up for what looked like a live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good but we left before he really got started. \n\n\nWhen it's all said and done, we should have just went to the Sharp Edge down the street. Probably a much safer bet for future endeavors."
"1","Owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal."
"2","This place is pretty good. The buffalo chicken spread and the jerked salmon are awesome. The service is always good especially at the bar. They have an upstairs lounge that is open for happy hour during the week. If you are looking to grab a few drinks after work with friends, the lounge upstairs is a good choice. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced with happy hour specials M-F. ($2 off all martinis and half price buffalo chicken spread)"
"2","My favorite bar in town love the live music and the martinis - fave is the strawberry shortcake!"
"1","This bar is cramped, overpriced, and the service is unbelievably slow. Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).\n\nSeriously, avoid this place. When one of your co-workers suggests a work happy hour, direct them anywhere else."
"2","Food was good, had scallops, ahi tuna salad and chicken wings which were all tasty and at a good price. Drinks were the highlight, try my favorites of the night, jalape\u00f1o Moscow mule and suit and tie."
"2","Me and one of my besties recently came here for a girl's night out on the town.  Since we're both parents and don't get out often without our children in tow, we wanted to make sure that we fully enjoy our food and drink wherever we decide to go.\n\nWe actually enjoyed ourselves very much, thank you, at this wonderful downtown spot.  We both ordered specialty martinis.  I had the Pink Lemonade and she had the Dragon Berry Cosmo.  Both drinks were delicious!  We also ordered Olive or Twist Calamari and the Thai Chicken wings as appetizers. (Yes, I know that's a lot of food for two people.  But, didn't I say we don't get out much in the evening without kids in tow?)  Yummy is the word for both.  I like my wings crispy and my calamari not overdone and both fit the bill.\n\nNow, about my braised beef short ribs.  Like some people wouldwalk a mile for a Camel, I would walk 10 miles for beef short ribs.  If I can take my fork and push the meat into collapse and have a good sauce to go with, I'm all yours!  My last name should now be \""OliveOrTwist\""!  Likewise, my bestie sat in silence and payed homage to the crabcake gods/goddesses that prepared her crabcakes.  A moment of slence please....\n\nOkay, I'm back.  But seriously, if you want to feel transported from Pittsburgh and imagine yourself in a hip little bar/restaurant in a more trendy city, this is your place."
"1","Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\""  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.\nWe started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toasted/fried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  \nThe problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  \nWith as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \""so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\""  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK?  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \""garlic mashed\"" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.\nI ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \""grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\""  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.\nOverall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out."
"2","I went here for a college alumni gathering on a Saturday, during the Three Rivers Art Fest. We were secluded in the upstairs area. I loved the atmosphere (very classy)  and the martinis (very unique and tasty). We dropped serious money on the drinks. We had a coupon from Foursquare for a free appetizer. I ordered the truffle fries, very delicious. I would recommend coming here for a cocktail or two, but if you're looking to put away some drinks, you could get more for your buck somewhere else. Then come here :)"
"1","I was really excited when I saw the menu for this place because they had some vegetarian items that sounded delicious. I liked the decor, with exposed brick walls, soft lighting and we went there on a night with live music. But the positives stop there. I had the veggie burger. The burger was the typical veggie burger that a lot of restaurants are trying now - with all of the veggies in the patty - and people continually make it mushy. The mushy texture made me nauseous so I didn't finish that. I got the side of garlic mashed potatoes, and I'm pretty confident those came out of a box, though that ended up being my favorite thing. \n\nMy date got nachos, which are advertised with lots of goodies on top. Lies! They were covered in melted but cold cheese, a sprinkle of diced tomatoes and a scoop each of guacamole and sour cream. Neither one of us ate more than 3 chips. \n\nFinally, I ordered Patron with Rose's line juice. First sip... Completely bitter and disgusting! So I asked her. And she said, oh right, we don't have sweetened line juice, he probably just used lime juice. So I asked for her to add some simple syrup, which she did. And then it was drinkable. But come on. She should have thought of that upfront! \n\nDon't go here for anything but the walls and music."
"1","So I decided to surprise my fianc\u00e9 one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). We both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. The martinis were just ok, and the food was very basic and nothing special. I will give the place another try and get some non appetizers next time and hope the bartender is a bit better at mixing the drinks."
"2","This place is good for drink before and after shows. I always wanted to try their food, but haven't yet. They have lots of different martinis. I will be back."
"2","This is my second time coming and I still love it and especially the Buffalo chicken spread! The atmosphere is a little dark for lunch time but over all it was a good experience.The service was also great."
"1","At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye."
"1","I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus, but then she failed to return to take our order for at least 20 minutes.  It would've been different if she had been slammed, but the entire time she was standing by the bar, just talking to her coworkers.  By the time she came to take our order we were ready to leave... and we should have... the martinis were not good and the server's disposition left much to be desired.  When we were ready to leave she made us feel like it was a bother to split our tabs between the five of us.  The one positive of the place was that I liked the ambiance, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else being lackluster.  What I was hoping to be a great ending to the night turned into a dismal experience that put everyone in a bad mood."
"2","I made it into Olive or Twist a few weeks ago to celebrate surviving my first week of graduate school!  My friend told me to pick wherever I wanted for a celebratory dinner, and Yelp brought me here.  The name was catchy, and the food looked cool.  And martinis are my drink of choice.  What's not to love?\n\nWe made reservations, but the bar upstairs was cooler so we went upstairs instead.  There are bar tables and couches and comfy chairs to hang out on.  The service was amazing, and we never wanted for anything.  Every need was met before we could even ask.\n\nI started out with the Orange Dreamsicle martini, and while it was on the sweet side, it was delicious!  If I return, I will definitely get another one of these.  Not strong alcohol wise but yummy.\n\nWe ordered the scallops and Asian fusion calamari for appetizers.  My friend was super upset with the scallops and thought they tasted bad.  I don't really know anything about scallops so I ate them.  He complained to the manager, and the manager was nice enough to take 1/2 off, which I thought was really nice considering it wasn't stopping me from eating them.  (#PoorKidProblems).  The calamari was really unique but delicious.  The actual calamari was good, but it was covered in some sauce similar to stir fry sauce.  It was good, and the portion was a really fair size for the price.\n\nI then moved onto the Key Lime Pie martini.  It was a let down after the Dreamsicle, but there was nothing wrong with it.  I personally preferred the first one.\n\nMy favorite food item was my entree.  I ordered the Penne ala Vodka, and when she put it on the table, I thought I had gone to garlic heaven.  Simple but wonderful.  There was also a very generous amount of asiago cheese on top of my pasta and a slice of prosciutto.  I took about half of the portion home, but I finished it off that night because it was so delicious.\n\nI really loved this place, and on a Friday night, it was EMPTY.  I don't know if this was because of Labor Day weekend or a Pirates game, but we were the only people in the bar area by 8:00.  Hopefully it was just a fluke because I liked Olive or Twist!"
"1","Visited with a party of 8 last weekend for a friend's birthday. We walked in the door and could see no apparent host stand, so we tried the door next to the one we entered. This ended up leading to a private party. Can you say awkward?\n\nWe went back in the main door, clearly confused. The bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks (rude!). Not even sure how we discovered it, but the host stand was in the BACK of the restaurant. How were we supposed to know this? We were seated, and had to wait awhile for service.\n\nFinally, the server came and took our drink orders and suggested a very strong drink for me. He was obviously trying to get me drunk (and succeeded). Caution: The Vesper is a strong *ss gin martini that is just okay. You pay 11 bucks to drink a shot of gin slowly from a fancy glass. \n\nHe then took our order...and did not think to write any of the 8 requests down. Yep, you guessed it. He screwed up our orders and bills, then proceeded to be rude about the situation. \n\nThe buffalo chicken dip is awesome, but be prepared, there is no chicken. We had one chunk in the two orders. The deep fried pita chips taste like donuts and are muy excellente. \n\nAlso, prepare yourself for bartenders squeezing caramel into glasses. The sound is reminiscent of flatulence. Over and over. So much flatulence. \n\nI was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner. The two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though.\n\nJesse from Bob Evans down the road is far superior to the condescending server here. We highly recommend Jesse."
"2","Fantastic martinis!!"
"2","I stopped by Olive or Twist for a couple of drinks with my friend and fellow Yelper Carrie W. after seeing The Nutcracker at the Benedum last Fri.  When Carrie suggested that we grab some drinks, I suggested that we go to Olive or Twist because I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile. I rarely receive the opportunity to go out for drinks after shows because some of my friends who I attend shows with tire out early (lame) or don't really go to bars ever (even lamer), so I was excited to finally have the opportunity to imbibe a few in a classy setting downtown.\n\nGiven that it was my birthday, I knew exactly what I wanted drink-wise, thanks to Rachel C.'s review: the cake batter martini!  Thanks to other reviews, I was aware that O or T's specialty martinis are dessert-y drinks rather than your typical martini.  This was absolutely fine by me, since I enjoy sweeter digestifs later at night.  As can be seen from my photo, this martini comes with a rim of chocolate syrup spangled with multicolored decorative sprinkles, which made for a very festive--and delicious--birthday drink.  Once I finished it, I went for a second round and chose the mint chocolate martini, which also came adorned with chocolate syrup.  It tasted exactly like melted mint ice cream--my favorite kind.  Yum!\n\nWe sat at the upstairs side bar, and service from the bartenders was generally good--one of them even wished me happy birthday when I mentioned why I was ordering the cake batter martini.  While it was busy, it wasn't so crowded as to feel claustrophobic.  The noise level was a bit on the loud side--but then again, what bar isn't?\n\nI really enjoyed my visit to O or T, and look forward to returning again, once I can convince my friends to stop by for a drink.  I'd love to check out the happy hour, in particular.  Because I haven't tried the regular (non-specialty) drinks or the food, I'm going with a 4, but I'll update my review once I return and do so."
"1","Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce, too.  I know it was only $4/$7 for a 6\""/12\"" sub, but it was pretty bad.  (I bought a 12\"", intending to take half home for later, but I wound up throwing the second half away, and I NEVER throw away food.)  \n\nAs a Italian grocery, it seems okay, but the attitudes are a little snippy, and it's a pretty grungy-looking place."
"2","This place has the most heavenly smell!\n\nThe pepperoni bread is an absolute must.  I was disappointed that there was no jalapeno bread left, but what can I do?  The prices are fantastic.  $5 for a full loaf of pepperoni bread, in NYC that's easily $8 to $12.  I will stop here before going home every time."
"2","$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf, need I say more.  The Italian bread is so yummy and makes great bruschetta.  They bake their bread fresh daily and do not include any preservative so eat it quick!"
"1","Maybe it's nostalgia for the cigar but I thought he looked ridiculous. He bragged about a $4 pepperoni roll. There's a reason it cost that, because it wasn't very good. The sauce was disappointing. I wouldn't come here for anything."
"1","The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions, and no hots or flavor. Bread better suited for pigeons than people. I can find better Italian sandwiches back home in Baltimore. We'll feed these to our dogs when we get home.  You get what you pay for. Avoid this tourist trap!"
"2","Pittsburgh Bound!  Part X\n\n(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/stamoolis-brothers-company-pittsburgh?hrid=8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q)\n\nThe Sunseri name is famous in Pittsburgh, and although their small alcove of Italian meats and bread is one of the smaller storefronts in the Strip, their pepperoni bread is melt in your mouth, filled with great mozzarella cheese.  I grabbed a loaf and we picked at it while we walked around.  My mom and I inhaled half of it without blinking an eye.\n\nIf you are going to get a loaf of Sunseri's pepperoni bread, I would suggest not doing it on an empty stomach.\n\n(For Part XI, go to: http://www.yelp.com/biz/primanti-brothers-pittsburgh?hrid=k97SGRvnhBMrHzqofs1WNg)"
"2","Well, folks, it's a transit system.  It's job is to get you from point A to point B and PAT does reasonably well at it.  I ride the 61A or the 61B (whichever comes first) to work.  My husband and I also use it when going to the Pirates or Penguins games or to the theater.  It's cheaper than gas and parking."
"2","I only want three things from a transit system:\n\n1. To get from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time (less than an hour if in city limits) and in reasonable comfort.\n2.  Reliable service.  If the schedule says a bus will arrive at a particular time, then the bus will arrive within about five minutes of that time.  If the schedule says buses arrive every 10 minutes, on average, then I expect to wait no more than about 15 minutes.\n3.  Affordable fares and passes.  Because price is one of the only areas in which public transit has the potential to be directly and immediately more convenient to a person than individual car ownership, prices to passengers should be kept to a minimum. \n\nBefore moving here, I heard all sorts of trash talk about Port Authority, but really, it's a decent transit system.  I use it to travel to and from all three of my jobs, and I have yet to be late because of the bus.  As such, Port Authority easily meets my first two transit requirements.  As for price, I miss San Francisco's $45 Fast Pass, but I'm willing to pay a premium for the reliability that Muni couldn't offer.  Still, $75 for a Zone 1 pass is a LOT of money when you're paid minimum wage--which I'm sure is the case for many passengers."
"1","First time in Pittsburgh, from Chicago. \n\n1. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WORKS.\n2. What is with the silly system of paying on your way out sometimes? It seems like the dumbest idea ever.\n3. Where are the reloadable transit cards?\n4. Why are the conductors so incredibly angry?\n5. Why do I need to request a stop on the \""T\""?\n\nOf the public transportation systems I've used, this is definitely the most confusing so far. Even if the website had an easier to understand fare explanation.\n\nLearn from the CTA. I have a new appreciation for Chicago Transit Authority."
"1","Fares keep going up. Another service cut this month. I think I'd rather walk to work in the middle of the night!"
"1","Oh, PAT buses, why can't I quit you?\n\nHere's the deal: I 100% blame Pittsburgh's bus system problems on Port Authority.  Between the winding bus routes, the inability of buses to show up on time, and the outrageous money spent on retirement plans, it should be disbanded.  The city needs to take over and reconfigure the entire system.  The Post-Gazette has printed some great pieces that explain how the system could be overhauled.\n\nI've been a bus rider since birth (I still never drive), and it's only gotten worse over the years.  Some routes are great (outside of rush hours), others are ridiculous, and some good routes were recently cut.  Until transfers are free (which they should be within an hour window, in my opinion), it was insane to cut the 500, which added $10 a week to my bus tab just to get to work.\n\nIt is usable?  If you don't care about being on time.  I shouldn't have to show up 10 minutes early to catch a bus that should be coming by every 20 minutes according to the schedule.  I shouldn't have to stand in the middle of downtown traffic to flag down the 28x Airport Flyer when I'm standing at the stop and have an enormous purple suitcase.  When I'm going to work, I look up when I should be arriving...And then go back 1-2 time blocks to make sure I'm on time since I can't trust the bus.\n\nBus riders understand not all buses use the exclusive bus lanes, but maybe Port Authority should build the delays that happen every day into the schedule.  For example, there is not a chance that an inbound 71B takes a similar amount of time during the morning rush hour as it does mid-day.  I know this from experience.  Why doesn't the schedule know this?\n\nThe buses are so bad that now that I am two miles from work, I walk to and from every day.  In fact, I often BEAT the 71B home.  That means as I stroll two miles down Fifth Avenue, not a single bus passes me.  On the busiest section of the busiest non-highway street in Pittsburgh (data according to me).  How is this possible?\n\nFinally, we live in Pittsburgh.  It's cold or raining or miserable most of the year.  I would gladly take fewer stops in exchange for heated bus shelters.  It would also be nice if these imaginary shelters could have bus arrival information.  Pitt's on the right track with their bus shelters at the Cathedral--take note."
"1","I would give it a \""1-star\"" review but the caption under \""2-star\"" is more like it, \""Meh.  I've experience better.\""\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with PAT.  The buses are unreliable timing wise and a majority of the drivers are jerks.  From having to be 10 minutes early (I shouldn't have to play it safe!) to being prepared to wait for a couple buses since rush hour means over crowded buses ... PAT is like a powder keg.  You just never know when its going to blow up on your commute.\n\nI do ride the bus daily.  And yes, it would take me the exact amount of time to drive in/out to work.  So honestly ... I treat PAT like I treat Airplane travel.  I get there when I get there ... as lone as I get there safely the on-time part is something I have learned to stop prioritizing as long as I'm riding a PAT bus.  ((Seriously tho, there's something wrong about having to make that concession!!))"
"1","Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour, but this was not.  The bus was running every 20 minutes both times, according to the PAT schedule. When I gave up last night and went into my apartment, it was an additional 10 minutes before the bus went by...So let's review: I waited a total of 45 minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every 20 minutes.  For shame!\n\nFrom now on, I'll be hoofing it across the East End instead of buying a bus pass.  It will be cold, but at least I'll be moving."
"1","I don't even really know where to begin with this review. I guess the most sensical thing to do with such a nonsensical transit system is a pros and cons list. (If nothing it will be the quickest and least painful for me and for you, my dear sweet reader.)\n\nPros -\nIt is rare to find I can't get a bus to a place I want to go. Truth be told I don't leave the city a whole lot, but anytime I want to get somewhere with some leg work I can find a bus to take me where I want.\n\nMy morning bus (especially the insanely early 5am 86 from Bloomfield to work and the gym downtown) is almost always on time. \n\nCons - \nIt's a known fact that the last 54 from the Southside to the East End/Oakland/Etc rarely to never comes and the \""last one\"" is NOT late enough to be considered an after the bars options to get home.\n\nIt's pretty common for the buses to either be a full 15 min early or 10 min late.\n\nI've seen more than one person pee themselves.\n\nI've had a bus driver just plain ignore my request for a stop and then ignore ME while I'm telling them as much.\n\nPACKED buses and constantly cutting routes and trips.\n\nDirty buses. I've seen a dirty diaper or two.\n\nI don't own a car so it's really my only mode of transportation since we can catch cabs here like in a normal city. I'd be lost without it, but it could be much much much better."
"1","Don't ever get too comfortable with PAT--- they end up swiping everything out from under your feet, and then charging you a crapload for it.  I can't believe they're slashing more routes, and charging more!  Why would I pay you for continual service downgrades?!!?  You're not even offering a bus to the airport anymore here soon--- Do you know how many people ride that bus to WORK at/around the airport.  I tell you what.... Whoever runs your company is A DUMBASS to the 10th degree.\n\nGet your shit together.  Seriously.  Id rather walk from my work downtown, to my home in Oakland (thats an hour walk, and MORE than a mile) while Im 8 months pregnant,  than pay you assholes to take me home. \n\n\nP.S. I didnt even want to give it ONE star."
"1","Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut it's expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 for a ticket, and an extra $1 for a transfer (which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers.) Coming from a maximum of $3 for two and a half hours of bus rides (express bus during rush hour), Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.\n\nThere's no day pass. Boo. If you're traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.\n\nAlso, the 28X doesn't pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland (or drop them off in the reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. (There's also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly.)"
"1","A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT\n\n\nI am concerned with the future of Port Authority, will Pittsburgh continue to have bus service as we know it?\nPort Authority constantly causes me a great deal of anxiety.  I have been riding the bus for as long as I can remember. We never had a car in my family. Now I am starting to feel like I've taken the bus for granted.\n\nI have a license but I choose not to drive...because I work Downtown and the cost of renting a parking space Downtown is HIGH!!! \n\nAnyway Port Authority to sum it up, is a hot damn mess.  How could I have forgotten? \nI have been shut in bus doors by ignorant, rude, nasty bus drivers Twice!!! \n\nAnd when it happen the first time, the bus drive wouldn't even apologize to me, \nThe bus drivers are a miserable bunch, just down right rotten,"
"1","I bought a home over 3 and half years ago because it was on a bus line. One  year after they cut that  route after being there over 50 years. I think the way they operate is beyond poor and every year there is a far increase now i have to drive to a park in ride. You never know what you going to intale every day on teh bus. Ive been taking for about 10 years now and i think ive seen everything to the pee smell to no air to no heat to arguements between drivers and riders. If they continue on this path there will be no service to downtown just people who live in the city. They crossed out the suburbs. It should be the port authority of pittsburgh not allegheny county. The only thing is can say is the port authority drivers do a great job putting up with what they got. Oh and did i mention i cant tell you how many times they have broken down. Now they have a federal grant for the connectcard about time. Its only been in new york and dc for years!!! I am sure there will be lots of bugs in this system to"
"1","I don't understand why Pittsburghers routinely put up with the idiocy that is our public transportation system.  Port Authority of Allegheny County is public transportation with massive, severe, permanent brain damage.  Unreliable, buses routinely don't come at all during heavy commuting times (like when you're trying to get to work on time), many of the drivers are assholes, the fare doubled in a decade and the service was cut in half.  The county refuses to fund it.  Getting on and off is confusing.  When to pay is confusing.  The schedules are hard to read.  The service isn't frequent enough.  The subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown.  This is horrible and it's one of the main things keeping Pittsburgh from being as great a city as it can be.  Call center people are sometimes rude and mostly unresponsive.  What else?  The buses smell like urine.  Sucks, sucks, sucks.  I live 3 miles from downtown and I commute by walking every day, to and from, because Port Authority of Allegheny County buses suck that bad."
"1","The only pro about Port Authority is it gets you from point a to point b. \n\nI've had buses that smell like pee. I've had buses where the bus drivers are yelling at drivers or people downtown. Screaming insults out the window.  Had a bus driver doing like 70mph down McKnight road. \nAt least twice a week I get a bus that's farebox is broke.  Yeah a free ride is nice but port authority is always crying wanting to increase their already ridiculous fare prices. Routes are always getting cut which leaves buses jam packed. \n\nThey introduce the connect card (an alternative to cash and passes. If I load $20.00 onto the card I should be able to get a transfer without entering cash the drivers don't know that and argue about it.  Feel free to train your employees. \n\nOn an 80 degree day one buses heat was on full blast. Not the drivers fault. He finally pulled over restarted the bus and it read 98 degrees before the air worked.\n\nBuses are late all the time.  When going to work I need to leave at least an hour before I should have to, to ensure I get to work on time. \n\nI can go on forever..."
"1","If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus."
"1","Awful!!!\nNever EVER follows schedule! Lets you wait for literally over an hour on a bus that is supposed to be running every 15 min."
"1","Port Authority of Allegheny County employs some very, very bad drivers.\n\nA driver deliberately cut me off a few minutes ago on Liberty Avenue downtown. Further, the driver did not express that he was sorry for cutting me off and forcing me to swerve into oncoming traffic. \n\nThe driver is a middle-aged man. He was driving the G2 bus. The bus number is 5525. \n\nI will call the Port Authority in a few minutes to lodge my complaint; however, I wanted to lodge it here too for two reasons. First, the complaint bears on the Port Authority's ability to keep its riders safe (because the driver almost caused an accident, which could have resulted in injuries to the riders of the bus). Second, if this driver causes an accident in the future, I hope this complaint will help injured parties make a case for negligent retention or negligent supervision against the Port Authority."
"1","Officials estimated about 400,000 people would be in downtown for the 4th of July.  I wish someone had informed the Port Authority of this.  Maybe then they would have had more than one bus running every 20 minutes after the fireworks.  Every single bus stop in downtown had about 300 people waiting for the already overcrowded buses.  If a bus actually did stop (some were so full, they just drove by), fights would break out over who of the 300 people would get one of four standing room only spots on the bus."
"1","As a car-less denizen of PGH, I rely on PAT buses to get from Point A to Point B.  Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\n\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\n\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\n\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\n\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\n\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\n\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\n\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\n\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere."
"1","How is it port authority has the money to build a pointless over pass on the east liberty busway, but can't update their online system for smart phones to be able to determine where a bus is located at? I waited two hours today in the freeZing cold to get to work. Had to call off it was just to cold out!"
"2","Need to get to Mass on a holy day of obligation?  This church is the perfect place.  On Holy Days they offer a multitude of Mass times so you can get to Mass and still get to work for the day.  I really like that they have a Mass early enough to still get me to work by 7:30.  They also have noontime Masses and even early evening.\n\nThe parish is welcoming and Mass has always been liturgically correct with relevant homilies.\n\nThe interior is simple, but their is beauty in that simplicity.  Glad to have an easily accessible church downtown!"
"2","Ah...Jo Jo's.  What can I say?  Forget Primanti's at 2 AM.  I'm no fan of starch on my sandwich and I fully expect (and invite) the crush of Pittsburgh haters that will say that I am blaspheming.  I just don't like a whole meal on my bread.  Lettuce, tomato, appropriate condiment and meat.  You say \""weirdo\"" and I say \""renaissance chick\"".  Anyhoo, this review is constructed from the few drunken moments I can remember from when I went, but I do recall the comfort of the wooden pews, the waitress patient with drunkards, great scenery from the other drunks, staggering in and out.  The food was large and in charge and sufficiently greasy to make sure you could function the next day.  I feel that grease and hooch battle it out in my tummy and grease always wins.  I got a booty call and subsequently had my order wrapped to go, which the waitress was really great about.  Turns out I probably should have stayed at Jo Jo's!  ;-)"
"1","4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay, but not great; standard breakfast diner fare.  The staff is friendly.  The prices are all right for what you get.  What I found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating.  The seats at the counter were torn and tilting off the base.  The booths were fast-food style: hard and tight.  It's as if they designed the seating to be uncomfortable so that you wouldn't linger."
"1","First off:  I'm a picky eater, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nOkay, I'm not from pittsburgh.  I am not overweight, not a hipster, not on any of the plethora of drugs, I own my own home,  Probably most of all, I've never heard anything about this place before walking in, so I had no idea what to expect besides \""Lets get breakfast.\""\n\nIf you are the opposite of any of these points, this place is probably worth a try for you.\n\nWe had a horrendous wait, but I think that was a complete fluke:  we had a huge group and there was an event that weekend...I don't think anyone with less than 3-4 had that long of a wait at all.\n\nThe waitresses are ornery, but not rude...just clear.  They aren't going to make nice or kiss your rear, they're not there for that.  I found this respectable, and liked it.\n\nBut the food?  Oh God.\n\nPros:  Portions are massive, all the other reviews will tell you that.\n            1) Prices are reasonable, cheap even, but I suppose that has something to do with the fact that the first pound or two of your meal is pure potato.  Seriously...I think I had at *least* three idaho russets in chipped form on my plate alone.\n            2) ....uhm.  ....  Nothing was dry?\n\nCons:  There was no color anywhere.  Absolutely everything on every plate I saw in the place was some blend of beige.  Potatoes, egg white, pancake, sausage...after you tilted the whatever-grease-that-was out of your dish, everything was the same color.  \n             Half my dish was potato.  \n             The egg was not over-medium, it was still-runny, even the whites.  I presume this was because they were slammed, and didn't have time to cook what were almost certainly factory-chicken eggs.\n             The sausage was not identifiably sausage.\n             I had my entire day's required calories in butter alone on the toast.\n             There was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu.  Nothing raw, nothing green, nothing fresh, not even as an ingredient. Even McDonalds has a fruit cup, ffs!  TACO BELL has better quality food!\n             \n\nTake one look at the clientele when you walk in.  It attracts exactly the kind of people you would picture in a dingy greasy-spoon truck-stop.  If you are not one of those people, Do Not Bother, this place makes Denny's look classy."
"1","Clearly based on other reviews, I should try this during daylight hours. \n\nWe went after a long night out, landing there around 2:30. I've been to plenty of late night places, after-hour bars, etc, but I've never been as scared as I was at Jo-jo's. \n\n2 fights broke out while we were there. First a group of guys, then their girlfriends. Then a guy at the next table threw up on the ground -some splashing on my leg. \n\nThen we heard police sirens and the fights were escalating - so we bolted. Maybe this is a rare experience? Anyway - I won't be heading back anytime soon!"
"2","Been going Labad's since childhood.  Very nice guys - they act like they can be your uncles!\n\nThe place hasn't changed since the late 80s.  Excellent food and well stocked groceries.\n\nIf you have never been to the Penn Avenue district of Pittsburgh, you are doing yourself a great disservice."
"2","Trust a man with an epic mustache. \n\nMade a stop here to pick up ingredients for a Middle Eastern lentils and rice dish; Mustache Man taught me the name of the dish in Arabic and gave me detailed instructions on how to cook it. He recommended the best bulk rice (basmati) and the best bulk lentils (green) for the dish and now I just want to stop in casually to ask him how his weightlifting is going!\n\nThe sliced almonds I bought at Salem's in North Oakland had bugs in them; The ones I bought here did not. Another plus."
"2","I like this place. So far I have tried the hummus and the falafel, it was good. I  lived in Israel, so I have eaten my fair share of middle eastern cuisine. The only feedback I have is that the store looks a bit dirty. I think that could be a turnoff to some.... I think they could do a few things to freshen the place up and make it known they serve food, I think they would get more business this way, and people would not miss out on the great middle eastern cuisine. The man at the front desk is very kind as well."
"2","This review is for both the particular location that I used back on September 23rd, 2012 and for Avis' customer service on their 800 number just now.\n\nI had arrived to Pittsburgh at 6am via bus from NYC and had several options for renting a car (see photo). Avis turned out to be the best deal on top of being located in an easy-to-find location (in addition to being easy to return the car).\n\nI was aware of a 29-minute grace period before being charged another day (or hour). The clock/timer on the parking garage entrance was 6 minutes fast, and me being me, this mattered. It said I returned at 8:47 even though my cell phone showed 8:41am. I immediately took a photo, intending to use this in case I were to be overcharged, even though the location doesn't open for business until 9am and wouldn't be able to rent the car out to anyone for another ~20 minutes anyway.\n\nI was back in Pittsburgh on October 9th and made it a special point to get back to the place so I could resolve the situation in person. It turned out that it's hard for the particular store location to make adjustments if it's been more than a few days. The guy there, Francis, said it's not a huge deal to make the adjustment but that it's out of his control and that if I call the 800 number, it should be fine.\n\nPause for ~6 months.\n\nSo yeah, today I finally made time to pick up the papers and phone and make a call. They first said I returned the car late and then after I explained the situation and offered to send the photo I took that demonstrates the clock discrepancy, they gave me a 'one-time courtesy' and I'm now ~75 dollars richer. Or less poor. Your call."
"1","This was the worst service I have ever gotten, the employee at the airport avis center stole money from us. We were trying to rent a car in the airport and we thought the price was too expensive, so we asked her not to swipe the card while we confirmed that we wanted this price while we leave she swipes our card. And what happened we are 3500$ short. \n\nAlso the prices are really bad here, for one car the price with insurance was 3500$ while at enterprise is 1700$. \n\nWe still haven't gotten our money back and now we have no money in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania. Avis customer service says we have to wait 72 hours. Thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars. \n\nNever go here."
"2","Very friendly service and a nice selection at this restaurant supply store. This is a small business, so they don't have every kitchen item that you might want, but they have a lot of things, and commercial-grade quality. I picked up a hefty polypropylene cutting board on my last visit. Vastly superior to the department store versions. Fair prices, too."
"1","i find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine. christine's conduct/attitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude, unprofessional, and insulting. not only did she not respond to my facebook question on her salon's page, but only after an email to her, did she reply with a curt answer, and to add insult to injury, she's banned me from further posting/commenting on the salon's facebook page. i didn't realize an inquiry regarding a product for which i'm paying wasn't permitted. instead of setting the record straight (which should've been done), she elected to ignore my question, delete it from facebook, and then ban me from the salon's page. wow. that said, i'll really miss katie, as she's a great hairstylist and colorist."
"1","I purchased a gift certificate up front from them only to find out that they were never going to let me use it.    I kept calling to try to make appointments and each time I called, the staff was rude and said that they had no appointments.    My gift certificate expired because they never had any appointments available (or so they said) and when I explained my situation to them over the phone, they were extremely rude.    I said that I would tell my friends and family about my awful experience there and about how they took my money but never provided services to me.    The staff said something extremely rude to me over the phone and then hung up.\n\nI will never give this salon my money again.     It's a shame that I'm out 50 bucks and have nothing to show for it.     I was scammed."
"2","JR H and I seemed to miss each other this weekend in Pitt. Always going to the same place yet not really.  Our little group, which inlcuded the parents(yeah i still get free food) went to the Market Square location. The location is nice. Market Square is a nice area. Brick inlaid street. Clsoe to 3 river point park and my hotel.\nThis restaurant is something one must do when in town. It was also on Food Network, and man times reviewed here at Yelp. The food is pretty good. Where else can you get a \""value meal\"" between to slices of bread. The sandwiches for those just learning. Your choice of meat with some nice itailian deli selections, kolbassi(haven't seen that  on a menu i around SF), or fish, below a nice bed of fresh made and not too dripping wet coleslaw. Fries with that? Heck yes and they sit right on top.  All on a Itialian sliced bread. The have a daily beer special 24oz beer for about  $2.50. \nNow this place and the food is fun. The food gets better tasting as the hours get late on a night out. Think how great a bacon wrapped dog is after \""dancing\"" the night away. You know that fun 3 step dance. Raise beer, tip glass, put back down. The kind of food and place you want to head when you cheat on your diet, watch some footbal and chat up with the locals.\nThe staff was very good. The food came quick. Best of all. It had no kick back later or the next day."
"2","We made a trip to Pittsburgh a month back and a friend of mine insisted that we get a sandwich from Primanti's.  It was everything I'd hoped for.  I had a roast beef.  It was topped with slaw and fries and I threw a little hot sauce in there.\n\nWash it down with an Iron City."
"2","Hey a sandwich with the fries and slaw inside served on a wax paper sheet and tasty (maybe a little bland, may have not chosen the best type) but would go back in a second."
"1","Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:\n\nTake two slices of Italian Bread, between them, mash together bland cole slaw, fries, some assorted meat, tomatoes. And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here, so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day. \n\nThe service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.\n\nIt was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.\n\nI think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw. \nI came, I saw, and I conquered, but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again."
"2","One night I was watching the Travel channel, they had a show called Top 10 Places to Pig Out.  Of course I paying attention and taking notes :)  When they mentioned Primanti's and Pittsburgh I was like Yes! I'm there!  I could not wait to get my hands on this giant sammich of all sammiches.  My only regret is that I couldn't get it with a Yeungling :( All the more reason to come back!  Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize.  I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese.  We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw.  Luckily, it was great! \nHere's the nitty gritty.  The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh! Needless to say I devoured this bad boy and desperately needed a nap afterwards.    I came. I saw. I ate.\n\np.s. You can get it topped with a fried egg! I didn't see that on the menu until I was leaving! doh! next time!"
"1","I must admit that not being from Pittsburgh, I walked into this place with very different expectations for what a \""cheesesteak\"" sandwich constituted. Having said that, while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great, the tiny piece of beef \""patty\"" that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.\n\nOn the plus side, the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm, where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks."
"1","I was out of town in Pittsburgh, and I was told this was the place to go to get the PA experience.  The meal started off pretty well with $2 Yuenglings and amazing chili, cheese, sour cream and bacon fries.  However, things took a turn for the worse when the famous sandwiches came out.  Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich, and the cole slaw was gross.  The bread was terrible, and overall, the sandwich made me nauseous.  Totally not worth it, unless you just go for the fries and drinks."
"2","The sandwiches here are massive.  Whatever you order winds up between two pieces of bread which seems both wrong and logical.  Regardless it is a mighty fine sandwich.  I wish I could get one right now..."
"2","This place is lengendary so naturally as a tourist - I had to go. I can sum it up in one word YUM!! Staff was friendly as we sat at the bar and watched the cook in action. I have never had a sandwich quite like that with a coleslaw like substance and fries on it, but I'd gladly eat it again. Lively fun place with people to match. Great for a quick casual bite."
"1","Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum up Pittsburgh in many ways:  big, over-the-top, tasteless, and unhealthy.  What more could you ask for? Unfortunately, this place is pretty dirty.  Make sure no flies land on your food.\n\nIt seems like Pittsburgh natives love this place, which is fine.  Its food certainly is unique.  However, if you're not from Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll walk away with a rather bland taste in your mouth.\n\nBy the way, do not pronounce the \""t\"" in Primanti.  It really irks native Pittsburghers.  It's pronounced \""Primanny.\""  Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way."
"2","As a visitor to Pittsburgh, I certainly can't claim to understand the nuances of the local culture.  But Primanti Bros., aside from being at the top of everyone's recommendation list for places to eat, just oozes personality, and to boot, it's a fun place to just chill and get a damn good meal.\n\nThe whole french-fries-and-coleslaw-stuffed-into-a-sandwich thing would only be gimmicky if it weren't freakin' delicious.  It's impossible to look cute and shove one of these things into your mouth at the same time... although perhaps that's the idea.\n\nNow I just have to try all the locations and figure out which one is the best of the best."
"1","The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful, noise, and not helpful for a newcomer to Primantis and Pittsburgh."
"2","Stopped in here while passing through Pittsburgh without knowing anything about the city or this establishment. Like gnats, we were attracted to Primati because their neon sign was... pretty.... soooooo pretty!\n\nAnyway, stopped in here and order the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which was quite tasty. We also got the Cajun chicken sandwich with cheese... because everything there comes with cheese. Everything. Need salt? Even that has cheese on it. It's kinda awesome.\n\nAnyway, both sandwiches were quite tasty and with the fries on top... yummy.  Would definitely come back here next time I'm coming through Pittsburgh, hopefully for longer than a few hours."
"1","We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp, hoping to get a real taste of Pittsburgh. What I ordered was a sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got was an inedible slab of overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, and mediocre fries, on white bread. The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.\n\nI was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King. Luckily we had a nice lunch at Salim's to wash the taste of this junk of our mouths."
"1","Worst sandwich on Earth.\nI'd rather eat a dead whore.\nPlease...never come here."
"1","Primanti Bros is basically the heart of all yinzers in Pittsburgh. However, I have to take primanti bros in doses. Their big ass sandwiches make me feel like I dont need to eat the rest of the week. Sometimes I love it for that and sometimes I hate it. Either way its a nice place to sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice cold beer with my friends. \n\n My only complaint about this particular primanti bros in market square is the people that it generates. Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal. My advice is, if you can, go to this primantis during the day for lunch dont go at night. If you can go to the one in the strip district or southside on 17th street."
"2","While the Downtown location doesn't have the extensive menu that the suburban locations have, any Primanti Brothers location will fill u up with one of the most unique sandwiches in the nation. Highly recommend the new Black Angus sandwich over the traditional \""No 2 Best Seller\"" ... or go with Capicola and Egg. Both delicious!"
"1","oh primanti's, you always disappoint! how can so much food bear so little taste? despite a brilliant premise (put all your edibles in the sandwich, leave your other hand free for the potables) the execution leaves much to be desired.\n\n1. these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly. they are always greasy on the outside, raw and mealy on the inside. don't think that just because they're INSIDE the sandwich doesn't mean you can get away with crappy fries.\n\n2. the bread. what the heck dudes? if you're going to put 3 lbs of ingredients in the sandwich, try to use a bread that doesn't immediately turn into insipid play-doh in your hands.\n\nI like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O), but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!"
"2","This is my second dance with Primanti's.  The first was at the Pitt location, which has a better atmosphere in my humble opinion.  I had the #2 most requested sandwich, Cheesesteak.  I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \""You're drinking it honey.\"" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  \n\nSo the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.  \n\nSo the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much."
"2","well you gotta give this place a star for its originality. coleslow and fries in your sandwich.. sound good? its actually pretty intresting. the coleslaw isn't creamy its a big vinegry, so it doesn't soak ur sandwich. fries are good too, if eat them fast enough. i had the pastrami sandwich.......dude... YUM! its super good. the steak wasnt' so great though, i shouldn't have traded half my sandwich. its one of the better sandwiches i can remember eating. the place is packed though, and there was a steelers game going on, ive never seen so many steelers fans before. crazy. but this place is good, its cheap, and you get a crazy lot amount. eat here!"
"1","I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review, but whatever. \n\nI was told by several people that I absolutely HAD to check out Primanti Bros while I was in Pittsburgh. I was excited about visiting this institution during my stay... but it really didn't deliver for me. \n\nYes, this was a huge sandwich with fries and cole slaw in it, but the sheer quantity of food didn't make up for the fact that it was really bland. Maybe I just got the wrong thing (the Pittsburger Cheese Steak - which is somehow their #2 seller...?). My friend liked her sandwich, which was eggs and bacon, I believe. Maybe we just went to the wrong Primanti Bros location. \n\nI would give this place another shot if I'm ever in town again, but my first impression wasn't a great one."
"1","GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland, the coleslaw was too tangy (and only contained cabbage) and the meat was scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get the cheese-steak sandwich if you go even though it says #2 best seller, it's awful! \n\nOkay on to service... Everyone seemed like they hated their job. Someone at my table asked for no tomatoes and add onions and of course she got tomatoes and no onions.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing and maybe they were all just having a bad day... Who knows."
"2","I found myself in Pittsburgh one Sunday morning while pursuing the baseball parks of America, and a little bit of preemptive research made it unavoidable to visit Pittsburgh and NOT have a Primanti Bros. sandwich.\n\nWhen I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed that movie since it so closely hit home to a dork like me), but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing but construction equipment and chain link fences.\n\nBut anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.\n\nSo being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of \""what is THE food for a tourist like me?\""  With a confident smirk, she simply says \""pastrami,\"" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much \""a suggestion\"" as it was \""the order,\"" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.\n\nSo in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.  But the food was good, and that's what's the most important."
"2","i love coming to pittsburgh solely for these sandwiches.  get a different one each time but they are to die for.  my new favorite is the capicola and egg.  i mean anything with fries and coleslaw on it can't be beat.  easily the best cole slaw i've ever had as well."
"1","Alright, I heard about this chain on Man v. Food and we just had to try it out. And honestly, we were quite disappointed. The sandwich is tasteless unless you douse it with condiments or get a particularly flavorful filling. I got the cheese one and my boyfriend got the colossal fish (both vegetarians--its not so friendly for us...fail). Neither sandwich was impressive--in size or taste. I'm a 5\""4' and 120lb girl and I finished mine no problem. Just incredibly bland. The bread tasted like cheap white bread, the fries were just incredibly greasy, the cole slaw was hardly cole slaw and more like wet cabbage. The cheese on mine was basically tasteless and my boyfriends fish was definitely from a box of something frozen. Very disappointing."
"1","Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh, you go to Primanti Bros. (My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game, and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location, and if you eat on the patio, it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers. \n\n I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely. Because you know, people being rude is hilarious. \n\nSo I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food, avoid at all costs"
"2","Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect. \n\nI chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there, but I will say this after you have gone once you will never need to go back unless its late and you need something to soak up the alcohol."
"1","My family always wanted to try Primanti. What a huge disappointment at the Anchor drive one. The pizza was served with a mound of burnt ashes on the bottom. Not a little, but teaspoons of it, all over. The ovens are not cleaned. I ordered the fish sandwich which came out cold, a soppy mess from the oil on the bread and a chunk of coleslaw core inedible. My sons was no better. The waitress saw we had taken only one bite and asked if we wanted to take home. We both said 'no way.' She didn't flinch and didn't care. I don't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid. In Philly, they'd be out of business in a heartbeat. It is also a dirty, noisy unkempt premises."
"2","There were French fries on my sandwich!\nThis is my first time in PA, so I wasnt sure what to expect when we were sent to Market Square for \""the greatest sandwich in the world!\""\n\nThe prices were dead on - about 6$ for a sandwich and 1.5$ for a tea.  I split a ham and cheese with my friend and we both left full.  I had the cole slaw (which was more like sauerkraut) and it was yummy.\n\nI am docking them a star because the service was less than desirable, even after the lunch rush ended."
"2","As good as advertised.  The sandwiches are big with quality cuts of meat.  I thought the slaw was delicious too adding a little vinegary tang to the fries.  Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff,"
"2","Oh so good and huge! Each sandwich is both tasty and large enough to feed two normal folks for lunch.\n\nAt the suggestion of the server, I ordered the Kolbassi Sandwich. It came fast and was oh so good! Also free soda refills.\n\nService was good mid afternoon on a weekday, and I enjoyed the whole experience watching the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremony on the flatscreens while eating."
"1","Okay, I'm a heretic. I'm prepared to be stoned by the fundamentalists.\n\nA native sent me here, an apparent Pittsburgh landmark. My wife and I are not cole slaw fans, so we ordered our hot sausage sandwich sans slaw.\n\nWhat I got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich. The fries were lifeless and the hot sausage was not not. The bread was devoid of texture and flavor.\n\nSo, yeah, I didn't order it The Way It's Supposed To Be. Maybe if you're into cole slaw, this is the place to go, but if you don't, keep walking. Service was indifferent, at best."
"1","My first time at Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh, PA.  I was not impressed with my sandwich there.  I've only been once so maybe I ordered the wrong thing but it just wasn't blowing my skirt up.\n\nI ordered the corned beef sandwich with the fries and slaw and it tasted a little bland to me.  It needed some sauce.  I think with some mustard this might have been great.  It was dry.  I did enjoy the cole slaw.\n\nThe service was fast and the server we had was very friendly and attentive."
"1","After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!"
"1","I'm with others here - not a lover of Primanti Bros.  Sandwiches are fine (I have ordered the turkey and cheese) but the service is horrible.  Rude, arrogant, and just nasty.  Plus when is the last time a broom has been taken to the floors?  (I'm reviewing the Monroeville one here)."
"1","Decided to try the place since I heard about it and is listed in things to do in Pittsburgh. This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.\n\nOrdered the \""2nd most popular\"" item which was the cheesesteak that was very, very plain. Nothing great about the patty. The thing was HUGE and stacked with fries and coleslaw which I found didn't work well (although there are others out there that do it with success!)\n\nYou can't deviate and ask for it without the coleslaw either and their menu stated it as \""All of our sandwiches come with...\""\n\nThe portions are huge, one order can feed 2 average appetites.  \n\nThe fries were the only upside of this place.\n\nThe service here is horrible.. there was 2 people running the place and our tables werent clean and it takes forever.. I don't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place.\n\nI don't think I will ever go back again."
"1","When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh, everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed. It was a big sandwich, but the flavour was not amazing. I also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. As a Chicago native, I feel it's the equivalent of people recommending Giordano's or Portillo's. They're not exactly the greatest places in town, but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. Do it just to say you did.\n\nI don't like coleslaw."
"2","I am still trying to figure out how to transport a few sandwiches back on the plane.....There is just something about Pittsburgh and their traditional comfort food!  I have addicted my husband."
"1","eh.\n\nGo here once to say you did. You'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it. It will be pretty huge. That is all.\n\nI might go back to check out the nightlife. I'll update my review then."
"1","Woulda been a 1 star review if not for our cute & courteous waitress.\n\nThat said: YUCK!   This was my second supremely dissapointing Primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  I guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  Bleh!  On my first Primanti experience, I ordered a corned beef sandwich as it shoud be, no fries or coleslaw on it.  So I was served 2 slices of bread and about 1.5 slices of corned beef.  What a rip off.  2nd experience, today, equally as awful.  But as i said... waitstaff was great.  I ordered a \""Pitts-burger\"" with coleslaw and fries on the side.  Seriously, the quality of the burger I was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.  I guess you really see what their overpriced, crappy sandwiches are truly made of when you strip off the fries & coleslaw.  Their fries are also soggy and gross.  Not a whole lot goin' on here except for cutie/attentive waitresses.  \n\nIf you want a decent, GIANT-sized sandwich and a real PGH experience, go to Peppi's."
"2","The original place in the Strip District is the best by far. Capicola & Cheese is my fav and though I'm not a fan of cole slaw, the fact that it's a dry slaw does it for me.  Bring your appetite and leave your attitude at the door."
"2","Based on what I've read on yelp, I tried the Pastrami.  The cole slaw, fries, meat, and the italian bread all came together in a really HUGE sandwhich that was really good for a few reasons.  Flavor, texture, quantity, and presentation.  Ordered a couple of Yuenglings to wash it all down...not bad."
"1","I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw, tomato, french fries and bread was just okay and made it soggy as I finished the second half. The sheer size of it all was just too much too. I wouldn't return again, though if you're visiting and into doing Pittsburgh touristy stuff I would say you would need to experience Primanti to judge for yourself."
"1","I walked in, sat down, and ordered an IC light. Looked around, and realized that this restaurant looks awfully like one of the restaurants I saw on the food network where the guy goes around and eats these ridiculously large meals. After eating a Pittsburgher (the second most popular dish) and trying the colossal fish sandwich, and a capicola sandwich, I've decided that the best part of my meal was the IC light. \n\nMy friend's colossal fish was the best of the three and it's best eaten as two meals. My Pittsburgher was the pitts and I wouldn't order it again. Unlike your pitts on a 90+ degree day, it was really dry. The sandwich was only salvaged by my grotesque use of hot sauce. The concept isn't that ridiculous either. Just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich. The chili cheese fries were mediocre as well, but the portion again was hugemongous.\n\nI'd come back here if I were in Pittsburgh again because its just a nice place to chill at on Market Square. But the food is only serviceable. Substituting quantity with quality can only get you so far.\n\nThe ambiance, service, atmosphere, and tradition makes this place pretty unique, but it don't make the food taste better."
"1","Maybe the expectations were too high, but I had a pastrami sandwich and I thought it was quite bland. The only flavors were vinegar and pepper. It was better with hot sauce, but I expected better."
"1","I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. \n\nWe scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.\n\nBe warned that everything here comes with french fries, even the salads."
"1","Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly, good when your drunk, but only when your drunk.\n\nI went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.  \n\nHalf the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The \""cheesesteak\"" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.  \n\nPrimantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland."
"1","I realize it's a sandwich shop and I dared to order a salad - but their menu is limited - so why put something on it if you're not going to do it right? Ordered a grilled chicken salad, take out. Got back to the hotel and found it had a pile of tasteless, cold french fries on it...so cold they never melted the shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. Also no salt or ketchup was included, so even if I DID want to eat stone cold, unseasoned fries, they would suck. The balsamic dressing I ordered was replaced by (fake) raspberry vinaigrette, so repulsive it required a trip all the way back  to the restaurant to get the correct dressing, which they were out of. Would have been nice to have been asked, since they did have Italian on hand - seems like a closer match. The iceberg lettuce, olive, and tomato salad, oh yeah, it did have a bit of chicken on it too, was okay once I scraped all that orange congealed \""cheese\"" off.  That and all the smokers hanging around the place (and Pittsburgh in general), I would say this place is a totally over-rated dump."
"1","Really bad service. Make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored"
"2","I've been here a handful of times, and I don't think I could ever get bored of their sandwiches.  Everything was reasonably-priced, and the sandwiches were gigantic and delicious.\n\nI've never had a wait here, nor have I ever had bad service.  I remember they had a fair selection of beers as well.\n\nLook, you're not going to Primanti's for five-star filet mignon, posh decorations and furnishing and waiters in black ties and suits.\n\nYou're going to Primanti's for a big manly sandwich that gets right to the chase.  Easy in, easy out...your taste buds will be delighted...and you'll leave with a full belly.\n\nThat's what you're getting here."
"2","I love this place. Their sammies are awesome. I am not a coleslaw fan but like it and choose to eat it here. The pictures below describe it nicely. It's a sandwhich with coleslaw and french fries on it. It may not sound right but it's excellent. The service isn't the best but it's usually because they are verrrry busy. It's not your healthiest place but hey, who cares."
"2","Mmmmmm, so much deliciousness. Cole slaw and fries on top of food that will elicit a chorus \u00e0 la Handel's Messiah from any drunkard worth her salt. \n\nGlasses of beer that won't stop urging you to take a gander at their naked bottoms.  \n\nAll the goodness of tasty food that compels writers to make exclusive use of fragmented sentences.\n\nI wanted to have an orgy with all the Primanti Brothers as a token of my gratitude, but since I almost fainted due to claustrophobia in the narrow stairwell on my way to the pissah, I suppose a thank you will just need to suffice."
"1","This is one of the most over hyped restaurant that I have ever been to.  I know it's a Pittsburgh legend. I have been there several times and every time say to myself, I won't be going back.  I only go there when dragged by coworkers.  \n\nThe restaurant is always packed, service is slow and you have to get up to get a drink refill from the cashier.  Yes it's unique having fries and cole slaw on your sandwiches, but the sandwiches are horrible.  Burnt Roast Beef or poor quality cheese steaks just don't cut it with me."
"1","Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.  They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich, not on the side.  Idea was born out of truckers wanting a meal they could eat on the road.  Yes, if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.  That being said, I have been a number of times and tried a number of different sandwiches and to be honest they all were fairly bland.  Lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion."
"2","Subway calls their line folks \""sandwich artists.\""  If those people are considered artists, then the cooks at Primanti Bros are friggin' Picasso.  \nIf you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.\n\nIf you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.  \nTip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.  \nTip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.  \nTip 3: The \""cheesesteak\"" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu. \nTip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.  \nTip 5: A 23oz  \""Iron\"" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.\n\nThe Market Square location is just as good as the original in the Strip.  Oakland is meh, Southside comes up third in my book.  I haven't been to others.  If you're coming in from out of town though, any of them will fit the ill."
"1","Primanti Brothers is definitely a Pittsburgh institution. If you are traveling through, you definitely have stop here, at least for the novelty factor. Overall, food is good for a... well, for a sandwich shop... But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back. \n\nThe real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \""who cares\"".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon."
"2","Stopped at the Market Square Primanti's this weekend after a Pirates game.  Salami sandwich was out of this world, and the 24 oz. IC Light wasn't too shabby, either.  Great post-10pm food!"
"1","I really don't know what the hype is about.  I was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant."
"1","Always love Primanti's and I was Central Pittsburgh area, so I went for lunch. It was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the \""no tomato\""? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service."
"1","ate at the one in North Versailles. floor filty, all young kids running the place, poor service, poorly made sandwich, very bad overall. The should have a manager on duty. I wont be back. thanks"
"1","Prior to writing my review for Primanti Bros., I put on my helmet, tooth guard, started my car and prepared to run away once the angry hordes of Pittsburghers read my review...Why you ask?   Get ready for it....deep breath...\n\nI...don't...like...Primantis...\n\nGasp!  Choke!  Faint!\n\nYes, yes, I know.  As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.\n\nI know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \""It's not that good.\"" and usually an apology afterward.\n\nSo there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret."
"1","I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.  The sandwiches, although unique, were not that good. It was all french fries and very little meat.  My husband and I were almost mad at how little meat was on the sandwiches.  We won't be going back but at least we experienced it."
"1","So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.  What a disappointment.  Head to DiBellas - much better service, subs and sandwiches."
"1","Underwhelming is one word that comes to mind. The meat tasted cheap, the fries were soggy and the sandwich as a whole was pretty tasteless.\nMaybe my expectations were just too high, I don't know. I went bc I had to, but I definitely will skip next time I'm in town."
"1","Previous reviews have said it well: Lackluster, tasteless food.\n\nAte at Primanti Bros with a group of friends while in Pittsburgh; we heard about it from 'Man vs. Food' and were assured that it is a Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.\n\nWe also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.\n\nThe legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch."
"2","I am a foodie so when I travel, I must try foods that are famous in the city that I visit. So, Primati Bros is a must on my Pittsburgh trip. Well, I was not disappoint after eating their #2 almost famous pittsburger.  Next time, I will try the pastrami. My friend had the pastrami, and it looked tastier."
"1","There was basically no cheese on my \""cheese combo sandwich\"", the fries were gross, and the waitress was nasty to us."
"1","Boring sandwich. Period. I fell for the \""hype\"" and while it was filling for $7 bucks, it just did not satisfy a craving...I had the corned beef."
"2","At first I didn't like this place. I tried a few sandwiches and liked the Pittsburgh classic idea more than the actual food. I was about to give up when I tried the roast beef. It's my sandwich every time I go now. I'll be back."
"2","People knock on this place - but I always find myself defending it. \n\nWhile it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous) \n\nThe fries are a bit bland but I'm a huge fan of the cole slaw they have there - while it may not be anything \""special\"" it's a classic (not creamy cole slaw mind you). The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak! But that's because I'm from Philadelphia and any cheese steak that isn't made and prepared there is not a cheese steak to me. \n\nThe only thing is the sanitation there is...questionable.  Just don't think about the sticky surfaces and slimy-ish floors. \n\nFor a cheap, giant sandwich I'd take the germs any day."
"2","Good beer and food was really good but the service was mediocre at best. But I love that I can here the game and not random music by Rihanna"
"1","Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.\n\nI don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that. \n\nAlas, that's all I liked.\n\nSo, why such a low score? Well:\n\nThe service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \""Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\"" \n\nAnd not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.\n\nTo make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.\n\nBefore you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again."
"2","Solid place for a Yuengling and a greasy sandwich. Try the Pittsburgher, a cheesesteak with a heaping helping of cole slaw and fries. A Pittsburgh institution, something that's worth checking out before leaving town."
"2","Years ago I saw Primanti Bros. on the food network while I lived in Ohio. I promised myself that when given the opportunity to try them I would.  I came on a lovely Friday afternoon so all the out door tables were taken. We came inside and sat at the bar. I ordered the bacon sandwich (bacon, fries, cole slaw and a fried egg) while my friend had the colossal fish sandwich. There was some SERIOUS bacon on my sammich! I was taken aback since so many places are stingy with bacon. My sandwich was over indulgent and amazing. I only ate half but took the rest home."
"1","We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. We can understand how it's a novelty to have fries on everything. But if they're not seasoned well and crisp...what's the point? When a place gets talked up so much, you can't help but have big expectations. We were disappointed...\n\nHere's the thing, when you sit down at a restaurant and the table is filthy, the menus have food all over them, and they bring your drinks in Solo cups...Without a doubt, if I were still in college and needed to nurse a hangover, this would probably be a go-to place. \n\nMy husband ordered the Italian Sausage, which was obscenely big, with good flavor, but again the fries were mush and flavorless. Luckily, we had ordered an additional side of slaw, because that's truly what made the sandwich, which was very tasty. We also ordered the \""vegetarian\"" soup which was good, but I ordered a chix salad because a MASSIVE sandwich with fries and slaw on it was just not calling me. Little did I know, the gimmick of fries on everything meant fries on everything....including my salad. It was really gross to have these tasteless grease piles on my salad which I couldn't even eat. Although we were dining there, the salad came in a plastic to-go box and pre-packaged dressing in a packet. The chicken was like tasteless rubber. \n\nWe checked of the \""Primanti Bros\"" box, but won't be back."
"2","You can't go to Pittsburgh and not get Primanti Bros.  For my fellow Detroiters it's like not going to Coney Island when friends are in town.    \n\nSandwiches are great - all of them come with coleslaw and frenchfries (ON the sandwich).  They have a full bar at this location.   It was in the high 80's with high humidity so a Blue Moon went perfect with our meals."
"1","I can't for the life of me figure out why all the hype. I was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat. But I'm a tourist here, and wanted to try it.\n\nIt was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.  \n\nThe thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty. \n\nThe fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip! (never give a zero tip, they'll think you forgot, always leave just a small amount of change)\n\nIf you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)\n\nThey left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!\n\nOf the 4 staff members I came in contact with, all but 1 were rude, unfriendly and uncaring. One constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it up.\n\nThe fries were good. \n\nNope, won't be back."
"1","Disappointed, big time.\n\nLocal info lauds this place as an institution.\n\nI say: pass.  The sandwich was soggy, bland, and just all-around not good.\n\nI didn't get sick from it, so that's a bonus.  \n\nChoose wisely.  Go to Meat & Potatoes instead, and order a sandwich there."
"1","My sister-in-law, husband, and I visited this Primanti Bros from all the hype we'd been hearing about it. I have to say its overrated. I wasn't impressed with my sandwich at all. I ordered the chicken breast, my hubby got the fish, and my SIL got the steak. It had thick white bread, an overload of cole slaw, and fries. I don't think the \""meat\"" you order makes a difference in the bland taste, as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the \""I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what\"" attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out. The place was constantly busy due to the full bar and nostalgic feel of the restaurant; it had it's own local charm. I'm glad to say I tried it, however I probably wouldn't go back on our next visit."
"2","Nice menu and good service \nI recommend"
"2","This joint makes excellent sandwiches. \n\nI ordered the fish sandwich and it was delicious! First off, its huge, and cheap. They stuff the sandwiches with cole slaw and fries (yummy). \n\nYou really can't go wrong here. \n\nThe place is usually packed to the brim, so you need to get in early before it gets full, which it will. Once it gets busy, the service gets worse. \n\nIf you're in the area, its definitely worth a try."
"1","Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW ,,, what a dissapointment , This place is so over hyped it isnt funny . To compare this place to the famous sandwich places is NYC is a joke . The sandwiches may be big , but only because they are over stuffed with fries and cole slaw . To steal a line from a old TV commercial .... WERE'S THE BEEF .....  A major major dissapointment ."
"1","If you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them, go for it.   But no good sandwich needs nonsense like that.  These are not very good sandwiches to begin with and adding soggy fries doesn't help.  Not to mention the bread is not fresh and is just a thick, bland wonder-bready thing.  \n\nI appreciate that they're not aiming at  customers like me.  Big sloppy sandwiches are fun for a lot of people so I hate to be a party pooper, but I don't think the quality is there."
"1","I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland, nothing had seasoning, not even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw on white bread trying to double for Italian bread. Save your time, money and calories and go to Wendy's instead."
"1","Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However, they only have two waitresses outside for about 20 tables. They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it? \n\n\nOur waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals. \n\nI would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality. \n\nIt's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers. \n\nWhile the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded."
"2","First time ever in Pittsburg and had to have Primanti Bros. Sandwich was awesome! (Cheesesteak) and a tall Yuengling to go with. Perfection!"
"1","I just moved here back in September and one of the first places i was told to go for great food was Primanti Bros. The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.\n\nWhat I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.\n\nFood can only get you so far, so my suggestion is if you want a good Food and can wait an hour feel free and come here. If you don't have the time just go next door to the Subway."
"1","Returned to Pittsburgh, Ate at Primanti a 2nd time:\n\nI stand by my decision: Pass."
"2","Primantis is the ideal Pittsburgh sandwich. Fries, coleslaw, provolone, whatever meat you'd like in between the famous mancinis bread. I love this location especially because of the hours. Living downtown it's hard to find places to eat late at night but the market Sqaure primantis is open till 12 o'clock 7 days a week. I've tried variations of the sandwich but my favorite so far is the pastrami. I went tonight and I'll be back again the near future."
"2","Not sure that I could eat here more than once every 10 years, but I'll take my chances. I suppose it helps that my doctor's office is 2,500 miles away and the chances are slim that I'll run into him here."
"1","I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok. \n\nWe ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress. \n\nThen, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\"". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us. \n\nWe were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where."
"1","Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, and a small piece of overcooked fish all piled together. Warm yiengling and mediocre service.   Aweful"
"2","Super friendly staff. Got there in the morning before the lunch rush. He sandwich is huge and delicious."
"1","Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop."
"1","Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place."
"2","My partner wanted to try a Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich and we read this was the best place to go. I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese, but I still loved my sandwich! I ordered the chicken sans cheese and fries, of course. The cole slaw was very good; I loved that it didn't have mayo in it and the flavor was great. Our waitress recommended that we try their hot sauce on the sandwiches and so glad we did because it really spiced it up and made the sandwich even better. My partner ordered the real deal and said it was delicious as well! We also ordered a \""small\"" beer, which is a full 12 oz glass, pretty sweet deal. \n\nHighly recommend this place"
"1","Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \""famous\"" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless, a customer should be able to get what they want. This place was trashy, dirty and probably not even up to code."
"1","This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield."
"2","In Pittsburgh visiting Carnegie Mellon U and was told we had to come here. I ordered the local famous burger. Can't remember the name but it was really good. The bartender was cool and the atmosphere was dope too. Cool place. I'd spend my money there again."
"1","I ordered a fave of diners, the Pittsburger. cheesesteak.  It's a burger with cheese coleslaw, French fries  all piled between 2 thick pieces of bread. Looked ok.  It, however, didn't work for me. \nThe coleslaw was great though!!\nIt's not much of a cheesesteak. It's a weird burger. That burger seemed like a fried frozen burger. Not much cheese either. \nMy crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great. \nI don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. I can't hold it against them though. \nI chose poorly. I think they are probably good though. \nMy motto: eat food you recognize."
"1","Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning, lots of flavor, and lots of heat if things are supposed to be spicy.  This sandwich shop lacks all of those things.  This was my first shot at local food (I think it's local, that's what I was told), and definitely nothing to write home about.  They did have some decent draft beer options but no one in my group of 10 said they would come back.  Try another \""local\"" joint if you have an option."
"1","Service sucked big time on Monday, June 9, at the Primanti's in Market Square. It took more than a half hour for my wife to get a cheese steak and the place wasn't even crowded. Missed the first inning of the Pirates game as a result. Boo!"
"1","Highly disappointing. While sandwich is unique it was totally over cooked and under seasoned. No flavor"
"1","So an honest review.  Bland.  Service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made.  I ordered the new black bean burger sandwich.  Bread not toasted, burger tasted a lot like my morning star black bean burger that I get frozen.  Cole sale was a lot better with the hot sauce I smothered on it.  The best part was by far the fries which weren't all that great.  I am glad that those were home made.  I picked all the bread off ate mostly the fries and was not very impressed.  The beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating.  I'm not a big foodie but I like my food taste better.  I still ate because I was hungry and it's not uneatable, just bland and kinda of boring.  It's still a must do in Pitts so go ahead and do it at least once, but skip the rest of your stay."
"2","I always try to hit this location when I'm in town. Great staff menu is solid & a Pittsburgh tradition."
"1","Great food overall at all locations! Go to another location to eat though. The Market Square location has the most horrible service I've ever experienced. Horrible!"
"1","i guess if you are in Pittsburgh and you want to do Pittsburgh things you have to grab a Primanti Bros sandwich but it isn't that good of a sandwich. Pittsburgh is loaded with great places to eat.  you can certainly do better.  having said that, i  totally get grabbing a Primanti Bros if you are in Pitt."
"2","This is my go-to place after a Pirate game to wait out the traffic. When it isn't busy the service is great and you can get a quick, cheap bite to eat. Always great to sit outside as well."
"2","I was recommended here by a friend as a place to cross off the Pittsburgh \""bucket list\"". I ended up getting the Pittsburger - it met my expectations, which was above average to begin with. I'd definitely come back here again."
"1","Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it, sat it on the bar and left it there for 10 minutes, when we finally saw her again had to ask her to grab it off the bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat in it is that of a frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries were good."
"2","Good prices and a Pittsburgh Classic. Kolbassi sandwich with Fries? Yum. Spicy rub pickles? Yum. Good beer, too. Nice outside seating but beware the pigeons, sit-down and counter service,"
"1","First Yelp review ever. Not impressed at all! 45% bread, 25% cole slaw, 25% fries, and 5% meat. The bread is cold and not grilled or warmed on the grill. Avoid and eat else where. Don't even think about the wings (dry and no flavor)."
"1","There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. This was highly recommended to us while visiting Pittsburgh. First, we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a Sunday. We wanted bar type food with a couple of drinks. We were told to go there by several people. I got the capacola, great concept putting the coleslaw and fries in the sandwich but it just tasted bland to me. I asked for them to toast the bread but they said they couldn't do it because it sticks to the grill... \""Can't put a piece of bread on the grill?\"" Again, when there a memories of this place I am sure the sandwich taste better than they really are. But as an outsider judging the food alone, it was sub par."
"1","I had the famous Pitts-Burger and it was disgusting! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the bread. The bread is super soft and tasty but the meat was gross and the cole slaw was bitter. I don't see what the hype is all about!"
"1","If you've been to Pittsburgh you know what to expect from a Primanti Sandwich. When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\n\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\n\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \n\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \""I don't know.\""  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\n\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\n\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \""Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\""Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\n\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \n\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip. I don't know what she left, but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us. All in all, I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we did."
"1","Definitely didn't live up to the expectations.  Being from the east coast I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches.  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich.  Outside of the bread I can't say it was memorable in any way.\n\nThat said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot more."
"1","Well, now I know why people don't usually put french fries in their sandwiches. Sandwich comes out huge and kind of dry, and you can't taste the meat at all."
"2","Was in town on a baseball stadium tour and heard about this place from the locals.I enjoyed my sandwiches and was hooked with the special slaw added to the sandwiches.I was also in luck once we caught the pirates game I noticed they had primantis in the park so I ordered another sandwich."
"1","customer service is always nice but dont you all think that this place is little over-rated? Their 'Almost Famous Sandwitches' need some hard work to get famous. Basically, this place is like Dr. Pepper soda. People are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous."
"2","Well I can say I came to Pittsburgh and finally tried the famous sandwich. Oh yes I was in carb coma, but it was so enjoyable. But I have no guilt for eating a whole sandwich by myself. I did wash it down with an ice cold beer. If you are in Pittsburgh like the Food Channel said you have to visit this establishment.  \n\nNow I have to be on a diet :-)"
"2","The sandwiches are giant, the atmosphere is good. I was there while the Steelers were on, so it was festive.\nI agree they are a little dry...so get hot sauce, or ask for some mayo or ranch, ect...\nAnd it was quite warm in there."
"1","I knew that once we hit Pittsburgh, we HAD to try Primanti Bros. Everybody AND their bro had been raving about it and I just had to give it a taste for myself. \n\nUnfortunately...my taste did me no great feat. I ordered the Capicola and Cheese from a waitress who would have rather thrown a sandwich in my face than take my order...no joke: service=terrible. HOWEVER, I was willing to give them a pass seeing as it was the day of a Steelers home game and that place was PACKKKKED. (I've done my fair share of service work and I know days like that can be a real bitch) Moving along...after I ordered for myself and my handsome ginger sidekick, I was oozing with excitement to get my butt in a seat and chow down on this sandwich I had heard about all weekend! \n\nFast Forward THIRTY. MINUTES. LATER. We get our food.\n\nOk, I get it, your busy. But let me reiterate here: FOUR tables were served before we were. And we only got two sandwiches. Insert pissed emoji here. \n\nSo, after all was said and done, my sandwich was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The service blew it for me. And I was so pumped too. Damn."
"2","Service was excellent! There girls work together so well and is like a welcome committee to the city!! Parking was a bit tricky because of some construction in the square, cool area tho. Food - odd the way they put things together, you would think it would taste nasty but actually it's awesome... slaw, fries and all!!"
"1","I've tried it twice now because if you ever mention you're going to Pittsburgh the first thing you hear is \""Oh Man, you HAVE to go to Primanti's\"".  Sorry, I guess it's just not my thing.  It's not horrible once I take off all the french fries they pile up, but it's definitely not my thing."
"1","I don't care for Primanti brothers.  It is overrated.  There are much better sandwiches in the city.\n\nThe sandwiches aren't bad, they just aren't great.  I like the fries.  I like the vinegar based cole slaw.  Both are great.  The white bread is fine.  My issue is with the main ingredients.  The main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality.\n\nMy other issue is their restaurants are all filthy.  I've been to 4 different Primanti locations and each one just seems greasy.\n\nBetter Pittsburgh Sandwich Alternatives:\nFathead's has a sandwich with kielbasa and pierogies.\nWingharts has a burger with fries and cole slaw."
"2","I was on a road trip back east from Ohio and was told there was no way that I could pass through PGH without stopping at Primanti Brothers. Through the best of fortunes, my friend whom I was meeting for lunch works very close to the Market Square location, so we decided to meet there.\n\nI was not disappointed...not in the least! Actually, I was surprised at how moist and delicious a sandwich laden down (in the best possible way) with cheese, cold cuts, cole slaw and french fries could be. And the service was great, too - I was worried that not being a local/regular might work against me, but our server was very friendly and helped to make this a great lunch experience. Since I was continuing on my eastward trek, I passed on the Yuengling's and opted for a ginger ale. (I THINK it was a Vernor's...it better had been!) \n\nMy only wish for Primanti's is that they had more vegetarian options (I know, I know...when in Rome, but my friend is a vegetarian and didn't have much to choose from on the menu). Also, trying to park in Market Square was, for want of a better word...trying. Not the restaurant's problem to solve, but I could imagine that those coming in who aren't on foot would like an easier way to leave their cars behind. Primanti Brothers is definitely worth the trip!"
"1","Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work, and so I've gone a few times.  Each time, I ask myself, \""Why am I going back?\""\n\nMediocre dish after Mediocre dish, somehow I think it will get better next time.\n\nLast time I had a Grilled Chicken Salad that they're known for --- at least that's what the cashier said.  It was grilled chicken, french fries, a little cheese on chopped lettuce. Can you say B-O-R-I-N-G?\n\nToday I had a steak hoagie.  Enough places in Pittsburgh do these that comparing them is easy.  While the bread is fresh, and the hoagie buns are huge --- it's all downhill from here.  Enter three slices of steak-ums and the contents of the hoagie are just flat. The bread is 90% of the meal. Unmemorable.\n\nI was happy with the pizza I had there, but for salads and hoagies? Not so much."
"1","I'm picky about the quality of meat, so I was disappointed when I specifically asked if the chicken parmesan sub had whole breast meat, the cashier said yes, then it turned out to be school cafeteria style chicken patty with bread crumb filler. Yuck, I should've trusted my gut and ordered the eggplant parm. K got the Italian sub. It was \""ok, not the greatest.\"" I recommend trying a different \""cheap eats\"" if you're downtown."
"1","There are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. The staff doesn't seem to care. Make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes Luke warm. Even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. You stand at the door 5min, walk to the counter and ask again then walk back and wait at the door forever again until finally you head back to the counter one last time and freak out.. all to pop a squat over the toilet. This has happened on two totally different occasions. \n\nThe workers themselves are ok and the managers are nice."
"1","I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.  He make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly. I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy, brown hair, and awesome tattoos).   \n \nThe major complaint that I have with this location is when the high schools let out.  The tons of students just hang out, cussing or making a lot of noise.  They sit on tables and often just sit at your table.  When Arby's and Wendy's use to be open next door, the management did not put up with this loitering."

"1","Their tacos are alright but their groceries are kind of expensive. I've never seen a can of Goya brand beans priced at $1.50. I mean it seems like a little thing, but they couldn't have been more than $.89 a can in San Francisco, where everything else is totally unaffordable."
"2","The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh?  Legit.  I always get two lengua tacos.  Lengua is Spanish for delicious, so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome (lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best tacos; super savory and always tender).\n\nTake a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal.  The customer is always right.\n\nAt 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right.\n\nThey also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos ($5 as well), but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA."
"1","I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to, considering they weren't priced). First I open the package and low-and-behold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave in a plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving the remaining ones for when I'm too drunk to care about anything. The tortillas are still worth it."
"2","Never had food from their taco stand (but it looks super delish), but I have been to the grocery store a few times now, and I dig it.\n\nOne of the major bummers about moving from Chicago to Pittsburgh was the total lack of a significant Latino population.  From Wikipedia: Latinos make up about 25% of the Chi-town population....about 2% of the Pittsburgh population.  Wah wah waaaaaah (sad trombone.  sad mariachi band?)\n\nSo the lack of authentic Latino ingredients has been a huge bummer.  Where's a girl supposed to get a taco around here?  This is why I was so happy to find Reyna.  In my home kitchen, we tend to cook lots of Asian and Indian food, but when we DO go the Latin America route, we want to do it right.  Homemade style.  So a place with fresh tortillas, Mexican cheeses, bulk dried peppers, Jumex (boyfriend is obsessed with these canned juices/nectars), and other tasty things is a much-needed addition to the Strip, with its diverse culinary offerings.\n\nI will always return here for Latin American ingredients - partially because Reyna is great, but also because - where else could you get that around here?  I do wish Reyna was bigger, but I shouldn't complain."
"2","I ate a taco here in the snow. IN THE SNOW! I've eaten a taco here sweating my bum off. I\""ve eaten a taco standing up because there's no tables. This taco stand is so amazing that I'll pretty much eat a taco here during a hurricane....if those happened in western PA! \n\nDoes this not show my true devotion to these tasty little taco's! Ok, I lied. I like them so much I just do it up big and get a burrito. It's just a magic mixture of rice, cheese, salsa and lots and lots of lime. I'm into the shrimp burrito because i love me some shrimp. But really, any type of meat or a veggie choice is going to be awesome. Plus they are cheap cheap cheap! \n\nDo me a favor and stop by this stand while you're out shopping in the strip, you will not regret it. Rain, snow or sunshine!"
"2","Best tacos in Pittsburgh. I mean I'll gladly love to be one-upped but til that day comes, best tacos in Pittsburgh! Tacos lenguas is always my choice. They have a very plush selection of Mexican groceries too. Oh and I'm a sucker for flash, so of course I love that spinning barrel they have up front with the blow torch roasting peppers. It makes the whole block smell wonderful!"
"2","Good: Mexican groceries in Pittsburgh\nBetter: The chipotle tomatillo salsa, homemade by Edgar.\nBest. The taco stand.  Seriously, if you're here, get a damn taco."
"1","Being from LA, I was disappointed with the tacos. The Carne Asada was bland and didn't think this is authentic Mexican food but another street faire."
"2","Renya's is a great resource for a lot of mexican and south american staples.  While you do need to price shop a bit to make sure you are getting a fair deal it has a lot of things that you just can't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. They also sell some cooking utensils and other helpful things like Yerba Mate gourds and straws (bombia?) of which I was having trouble finding replacements. You can certainly find these things online but I think it is fun to go in and find Day of the Dead candles and authentic pinata's for a mexican themed party and also walk out with all of the food to serve as well. Plus, buy local...I guess...is it local...yeah, is it local if it comes from thousands of miles away??? Now I am conflicted.\nMoving on...\nI'm not sure if they still have them, but at one point I got some great plantain strips that I think are made locally. If you ask for them the staff is usually really great with helping you find them. They are called Callaloo or Callolo. Give them a shot, and they are wonderful with all the fresh made salsas they carry in the deli cooler by the registers.\nIf you find yourself shopping with limited time in the strip district you should try the taco stand out front.  Of all the quick options down there this is the best one for a quick meal and the green sauce is incredible on everything (especially the tongue tacos)"
"2","I crave these tacos when the sun is shining!"
"2","The stand outside (edgars), chicken taco with everything on it, best ever."
"2","Easily my wife's favorite tacos in Pittsburgh. Pick your meat and then it is filled to the brim with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. I kind wish they let me fill my own tacos, but it isn't really practical since they generally have a line on the weekends. \n\nThe grocery has the best tortillas, tamales, and salsa in town. I bought the jumbo container of their taco seasoning so I can imitate at home."
"1","This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's, which is run by the same owner as Reyna's and Casa Reyna. Note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st Street, across the alley from Pamela's.\n\nI got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. The meat was cold before I could start eating it, and I assumed it had just cooled off quickly. \n\nWithin a few hours everything I had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. I felt sick and weak for the rest of the day, and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.\n\nNever going back, of course. This doesn't directly reflect on Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, but since the same people run it, it makes me worry about their food handling standards.\n\nI'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag of chips when I need them for a party, but I'm never eating any other prepared food from them again."
"2","Awesome food! Im from LA, so id like to think I know a thing or two about mexican food and I can honestly say this place is a homerun! Great salsa, fresh tortilla chips, friendly owners and staff."
"2","This is a top-notch mexican grocery, albeit a small one. They sell corn and flour tortillas made on location that will change your life. They also make a variety of fresh salsas and dips. It also has a good selection of hot sauces and pre-packaged salsas. There is a small selection of produce to and other groceries you need but might not find at regular grocery stores. Overall a must-visit if you're making some Mexican."
"1","I just moved to Pittsburgh from New Mexico and was excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I hoped. The cashier argued with my boyfriend over what kind of dried red chiles to buy, and harassed him when he was browsing the store (she yelled across the store: \""Are you done yet? I already started ringing you up.\""). The house-made corn tortillas were bland and only with the help of a guy running a nearby taco stand (who did not work at Reyna's) did we find the right chiles... The cashier had no idea what we were asking for.\n\nThen there was the Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly after arriving here, I was searching for Hatch green chile in the area and found out Reyna's would be doing pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered and paid for some online. The website said they would be roasting at the store so I called to ask about it. I was told in a very rude manner that roasting would only happen at the pepper festival, which I would have to pay $7 per person to attend, just to get my chile and get it roasted. Okay, fine. The day before the festival I called the store to confirm that my actual pre-order would be available at the festival. I was mid-question when the clerk on the phone interrupted me: \""What? ... Can you call back later, I'm really busy.\"" WTF?\n\nSo I go to the festival to get my chile. The people at the roasting station seem confused when I present my pre-order receipt, but they eventually figure it out, telling me to come back later to get t because it isn't roasted yet. We walked around the festival for an hour then went back, and there is even more confusion over whether ours is ready. Finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile. Hooray!\n\nOh wait though. We get home and open it up and... Apparently they don't know how to roast it correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles in New Mexico every year and never had issues peeling it before freezing it. This chile they roasted? It's somehow completely mushy and falling apart, but has almost no visible char, and it's fucking impossible to remove the peel. It's horrible. \n\nSo tl;dr - rude employees, both in person and on the phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely no knowledge of how to roast green chiles, despite having a whole event around the chiles. I won't be going back."
"1","This has always been my 'go to' place to buy the most awesome, authentic flour tortillas.  I always  bought them fresh, still warm at times.  I have often served them at my  home and have sent many friends to shop there. Yesterday, I raved about how wonderful they were to a total stranger and we both bought 2 packages from 'the fridge up front'.  I was so so very disappointed and if the person I 'sold' them to reads YELP, I apologize. They were dry and stale.  Steaming them made them somewhat edible, but.....\nWhich leads to my next review....\nI was so excited when they opened their restaurant as they sell  such tasty tacos on the street.  I have been there 3 times.  First off, THE  BEST margarita!  Food ok but service......horrible!!  The most efficient wait staff appears to be a 10-12 year old boy who has made our guacamole and aims to please.  When we were there over the weekend, the waiter outside  could do nothing more than tell us how busy he was and how he had to take the steps with each order. He got our salsa order wrong so needless to say, we left. \nThis makes me sad to write this. Did they bite off more than  they can chew?"
"1","I have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years I have lived in Pittsburgh but after this last visit NEVER AGAIN! The woman working there was so rude I could hardly believe it. A gentleman came in speaking Spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking English she was still rude to him.  I accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) I apologized profusely and felt so bad I bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. After I walked out I realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! I guess I should have just walked out without buying stuff. Its a shame because they are close to where I live but next time I'll take the trip to one of the Mexican groceries in Brookline."
"2","My favorite bar in the Strip District.  Timeless classic that never goes out of style.  They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect for outside dining when the sun decides to shine.  Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong with the lobster rolls.  The hot lobster roll is served on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth."
"2","Went to Rolands for lunch of a Sunday.  Around 30 beers on draft, but mostly the usual beers; only a few micros.\n\nThe actual menus themselves need updating; they're something you'd see in a crappy diner....photocopies stuffed into clear plastic film.  \n\nWe both got salads; one tuna & one salmon.  Huge pieces of fish that were of decent quality.  The upstairs has a cool balcony to hang out on in the summer.  It's a cool place in strip; I'd recommend stopping by and checking it out."
"1","OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back."
"1","I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.\n\nThe second time, though, was tonight, Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it, then. It wasn't very crowded, so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.\n\nOh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either."
"1","Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing."
"1","My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks. \n\nThe first time I dined here, I was unimpressed with their lobster roll (which is simply a hollowed-out white roll filled with lobster.  bread and seafood, that's IT).  Today, I was unimpressed with everything.\n\nExcept the woman two tables over who laughed like cigar-smoking circus clown and looked like Patrick Swayze in drag.  That was pretty awesome."
"1","Went to this place for lunch last Saturday, party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order, got the response \""We are out of that one\"". \n\nFinally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich), the response was \""I think we are out, but let me check\"". And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating. \nForget about getting a refill for your drink or water.."
"1","NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol"
"1","I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent, which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough, but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also, did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However, our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip, never coming back."
"1","It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.\n\nWe were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.  Our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  We were glad for the US Open entertainment.\n\nMy dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.  My mom and I shared a couple of appetizers, the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.\n\nService gets 2 stars and Food gets 3 stars.\n\nOverall, this place gets a 2.5 stars.  If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area."
"1","We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to Pittsburgh.\n\nFirst, all of the food was extremely overpriced. The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack. \n\nThe service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her \""second day on the job,\"" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).\n\nRoland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case."
"1","Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times and, while the fish sandwich is great, the staff and management have yet to figure out how to manage the tables. This establishment can become quite busy and, if you don't aggressively pursue service, you are likely to wait 20 minute or more just to get a menu.  This is particularly true if you are sitting in one of the outside areas."
"1","We headed to the strip district to soak in the atmosphere like any good tourist should do.\n\nUnfortunately we love to sleep and showed up a little late and by the time we were ready to eat (around 4pm) our list of recommended places to try were already closed for the day. \n\nRoland's was open though. As an added bonus they were showing the Steeler's game and there is nothing that Pittsburgh loves more than supporting the Steeler's and Penguin's. The atmosphere was great with everyone dressed in black and yellow and really into the game.\n\nWe ordered wedding soup (pretty delicious) and Portobello Mushroom Pizza. Maybe our mistake was not ordering seafood, anyway the caramelized onions on it were actually cooked in sugar (eww) and the sauce itself was just as sweet. It felt like we were eating candy.\n\nAs for the staff, Pittsburgh in general has some of the friendliest people I've come across in a long time. The staff here may not have been quite as friendly as we had come to expect from the rest of this lovely city but they were just fine."
"1","As others have said, nice location and sitting on the patio is nice in the warm sunny months, but the food is not anything special.  Fried seafood, decent lobster roll, other non-impressive dishes.  good for a few drinks and a quick bite if in the area."
"1","I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy, the drinks were expensive, and the service was awful.\n\nI complained to the manager about my experience and he told that if I didn't like it, there were plenty of other bars in The Strip District.\n\nPlease, please, please go somewhere else."
"1","Well I have had several meals over the years at Rolands, many of which were good.  Yesterday was not one of those days.\n\nAfter being seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  I was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.\n\nThen we order and when the food arrived, the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.\n\nI wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  My mother, who had the same food as I did, is feeling the same as me.\n\nGet your act together Rolands, you are better than this."
"1","Yuck!\n\nIt's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...\n\nI don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.  \n\nIt didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  \n\nThe salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  \n\nIf you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)"
"1","Just awful. \n\nMy companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.\n\nWe thought \""maybe it's a 'burgh thing.\""\n\nNope, we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef \""just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo.\"" This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.\n\nAnybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen. \n\nBy the way, my lobster roll was a buttery, greasy fail as well.\n\nWhat a complete disaster."
"1","this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.\n\nIf you find yourself at Rolands, do yourself a favor and leave and dine anywhere else in the Strip District.  Seriously."
"1","My fiance and I went to Roland's for a \""date night\"".  We were both craving seafood, and had never been here before.  When we arrived, we asked our waitress if there was a happy hour going on.  There was a happy hour and she gave us the menu for it and said she'd be back in a minute to take our order.  The happy hour ended 2 minutes after she gave us the menus, and she came back over 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  Needless to say, we were unable to take advantage of any specials.  We both ordered margaritas for our drinks.  They took a further 15 minutes to come out.  Not only were the drinks weak (and this is coming from a bartender), but one margarita was a substantially different color than the other (despite being the same type).  Additionally, we were charged over $7 apiece for those margaritas that were made with well liquor.  If I'm spending $7 on a margarita, it had either better be tasty or strong (or both).  Anyway, we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer.  We got the Raspberry-maple scallops.  There were cooked well, but served in a watery sauce that removed almost all of the raspberry-maple flavor..  Then we ordered dinner.  We both ordered their broiled seafood medley, which comes with a salad.  I had the caesar salad, although I used the word \""salad\"" in the loosest sense possible.  There was lettuce there, but only after I uncovered it from a cup of croutons and a cup of parmesan cheese (not the fresh kind).  I spent about 5 minutes just trying to reach the lettuce in my salad under all that other stuff, and even when I finished I still had more cheese than lettuce.  While we were eating our salads our entrees were brought out, and we had the luxury of watching them grow cold while we finished our salads.  I'm sorry, but when I'm spending $30 on a entree I would like it served hot and after my salad.  Additionally, we were not provided a change of silverware at any point during our meal and I kept having to \""clean\"" my fork and knife on a spare napkin.  During our meal I ordered a second drink (beer this time, since liquor is apparently too difficult for them) and had to wait another 10 or so minutes before it was brought out.  I had also run out of water and had to wait 15 minutes before it was even noticed, let alone waiting for a refill.  While there were aspects of this evening that were frustrating, I must say that all of my seafood was cooked perfectly (I just wish I had been able to enjoy my entree while it was hot).  When we had eaten our fill and asked for the to-go boxes, the waitress asked to bring our check.  We still wanted another round of drinks and possibly dessert, but she never asked for either.  Despite the feeling that we were being rushed and she wanted to hurry us along, I decided to order another drink.  In my opinion, it is good manners to make customers feel welcome, relaxed, and not rushed.  We did not feel any of these things.  This was supposed to be our date night and there were just so many little annoyances along the way.  Once again, the food was really well cooked, and if I could have left my tip for the kitchen staff instead of the waitress I would have.  They certainly earned it, and she didn't really seem to care.  Also, while our wait times could be expected during a lunch/dinner rush, there were maybe 7 people in the whole restaurant.  It's not like they were busy.  Our waitress was just too preoccupied with chatting with the other servers (in clear view of our table).\n\nIn short, I do not believe we will be dining here again.  We can get the same quality of food for cheaper and with much better service."
"1","If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again, or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.\n\nWhy on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly, I must not love myself or something.\n\nWant to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection."
"1","we went three for st, patrick day. Two harps bottle beers and 12 oyster costs $40."
"1","Poor service. Monday evening. restaurant not busy. Took 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Ordered a draft and a glass of wine and proceeded to order a lobster roll and steamed mussels. Took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. The lobster roll then showed up and we had finished and the plate was then cleared for the table. We had then been in the restaurant for an hour and we asked for the bill. The waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready. We canceled the order and the bill came with a quick huff and sign the top copy please request as she quickly turned away. Not worth wasting your time."
"1","Went on a Wednesday night, not crowded at all. Had to get up and go find someone to wait on our table....overheard who was supposed to be our server telling the hostess she didn't wait on us because she didn't want another table. The food was good, lobster roll and fish sandwiches were great. Service was just awful."
"1","Lobster roll was awesome.  There was a Moosehead beer cap in our fries and the waitress' response was, \""That must be from the beer batter.  I will give them hell.\""   I wasn't looking for a free meal but an apology from someone would have been appropriate."
"1","Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated , still came back cold. Steak was way over cooked. Never got appetizer we ordered, but was charged for it.  Was not busy but waitress was hard  to find. Would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone."
"1","Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast. \n\nI wanted a draft beer and was told that \""we don't serve draft beer upstairs\"". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The \""lobster rolls\"" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The \""lobster\"" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous. \n\nI won't be back. Ever."
"1","I've lived in Pittsburgh for what feels like forever and in all of that time, I guess I've never been to the Strip District on a Monday. We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.\n\nWe've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight! \n\nThat couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule? \n\nThe upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll."
"1","I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary."
"1","So, four of us came in for the first time.\n\nDiner 1 - ordered the lobster roll sandwich.  Lobster on a roll, nothing more...that's it.  Nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this.  A bland, poor excuse of a sandwich that does a disservice to all northeasterners who know what a lobster roll is, and this ain't it.  Is this lobster?  Read on.\n\nDiner 2 - ordered a large raw bar sampler, which was six Quahog clams, six oysters and six rubbery shrimp.  Who serves tough, chewy Quahogs on a raw bar?  This dive.  Also ordered the mussels, which were not seasoned and swimming in water.  No wine/garlic sauce as advertised on the menu - water.    Bland and awful.  Finished with the Mediterranean pizza which is spinach, feta and olives - the better part of the dinner.\n\nDiner 3 - steamed clams.  Again who serves Quahogs for steamed clams?  These amateurs.  Also had the clam chowder - which appropriately had minced Quahogs in it. \n\nDiner 4 - ordered the salad with the lobster roll, hold the bread.  Also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it.  Lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color.  Why the need to put lobster in a dye?   Because...it's not Maine lobster!  Imposter fish is dyed and artificially flavored, then frozen, then thawed, then microwaved at Roland's and called lobster.  That's my guess.\n\nSent the mussels back.  No offer to reduce the check or offer a comped dessert.   \n\nRest rooms are dirty, and smell of urine.  Men's was an awful smelling pit and I was told that the ladies had one toilet drenched with urine on the seat, another blocked up and overflowing and a third that could be used.\n\nThis place is a smelly, dingy, dive bar with horrible food and poor service.  It is a trap for the unsuspecting tourist. \n\nYou have been warned...STAY AWAY!"
"2","Lunch on a Wednesday with 4 people. Lobster rolls= excellent!  Crab cake sandwich= excellent!  Yummy, warm fries! Very good service and warm food!  Was worried when we saw poor rating on Yelp. Very happy and will come back!"
"1","Let's see.... Rolands can be fun to go to for happy hour after work on Friday.  Heck they used to have these two bartenders that if you were a good looking girl at least one would give you a beer or two but making up the difference by overcharging or flat out giving incorrect change back to some male patrons.  Anyhow, they have a somewhat unique upstairs and in the summer they have the balcony that you can sit out on.  One summer night it began to storm and one of their umbrellas flew off the base and cracked me in the head.  I though I was going to pass out, but the bartender just came out gathered the pieces and put them back together folding the umbrella down.  Yea no reason to apologize I just could have been decapitated.  \\\nNow onto the food.....uh  well....my best suggestion is, if you are on a timed lunch or have limited time for dinner, PICK SOMEWHERE ELSE!  you will only get frustrated with the SLOW AS HELL service.  Suggestions, hmm not entirely sure since nothing I ate here impressed me much.  The lobster roll, I am certain wasn't \""real\"" lobster and was very rubbery, and dry.  Way too much bun to lobster type meat, and overpriced for a sandwich, $15.00 I think.  Next we got the oysters.  6  were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered 5.  But good luck finding the waitress, she showed up 3x's in the hour and half that we were there for dinner.  Not because it took us an hour and half to eat but 15 minutes to get waited on.  15 more minutes for drinks, and to order.  45 minutes for food to come, and I think you get the picture... I wouldn't eat here again, there are many other places to choose from.  Lastly I ordered a draft beer it was warm, told the waiter who got me a bottle but still charged me for both... NICE..."
"1","I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  It's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the Strip.  I end up at Roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  They have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail, so I ordered those.  The oysters were absolutely disgusting.  They were not fresh, or cleaned very well.  My fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross, gritty taste to them.  They threw the POORLY deveined shrimp on ice, and it ended up soggy.  I had to pick the veins out myself, and after about two I lost my appetite.  As always, the service was terrible.  Next time I'm dragged to a happy hour there, I'll order water.  Never again will I spend money in this place.  YUCK!"
"1","Service was great, however, the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu, she was unable to give details on menu items.\nLets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering, or even getting there.  They were cold, limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill, and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!\n\nOh, the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?\n\nOverall, this joint was not that great."
"1","We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money."
"1","Overall, my experience was okay. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and helpful. We got the scallop appetizer and it was TO DIE FOR! I will 100% go back for that! That being said, it was downhill from there. We got the lobster roll and lobster ravioli...and both were \""ehhh.\"" The lobster roll had a ton of lobster on it (yeah!) but there wasn't any other seasoning or any type of dressing to tie it all together. The lobster  ravioli was the biggest disappointment because it had absolutely NO flavor....I had to grab the salt shaker and even then it barely had a taste. I can't even comment on the lobster inside of the ravioli because the whole thing just tasted like nothing.\n\nI'll go back for the scallops, but wouldn't recommend anything else."
"2","Overall, the experience here was pretty good.  I had the lobster roll previously and wanted to go back for it a second time on a Friday during lent.  I expected it to be quite crowded during dinner time, however arriving at 6:30 there was no wait for 3.  The lobster roll was pretty good, although I do remember it being better. I wished that there was something extra on the sandwich, such as melted butter. And they raised the price a dollar.  Roland's has a huge draft beer selection. Each of us tried a different beer and they were reasonably priced, around $4.50 each.  I would definitely go back, but not any time soon."
"1","This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again."
"1","I really wanted to like this place. The beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley. Unfortunately the food was not. The \""famous\"" lobster roll had so much butter on it I think I am going to have a heart attack in my sleep tonight. Can't recommend the place."
"1","Meh. \n\nClam chowder was big and OK.  Veggie sandwich had great,  greasy, grilled Mancini bread but came with soggy fries and was mediocre overall. \n\nOur waitress told us she was new at least 20 times so she wasn't much help in recommending any dishes. \n\nI probably won't go back again.  For $25 a person,  I can do better elsewhere \n."
"1","Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave."
"1","I travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  I was in town on a business trip and someone recommended Roland's Seafood Grill.  I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps. \n\nI ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \""Lobster Roll\"" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold. \n\nThe server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.  After nearly another 20 minutes she returned, apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of Guinness instead of the draft I ordered.  At this point I politely explained I did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.  \n\nI would be hard pressed to ever return.  With other great restaurant choices in the area I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at Roland's Seafood Grill."
"1","Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else."
"1","We (3 in our party) stopped in to Roland's while in the lively and interesting Strip District. We placed our drink and food selections with the waitress. She brought our soups, which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls. All were absolutely delicious. The lobster bisque actually had lots of pieces of lobster and the onion soup rich, beefy taste with lots of onions. The clam chowder had tons of clams and the portion was large enough for a meal!!! Our shrimp appetizers ...fried shrimp and shrimp cooked in a beer broth were excellent. Unfortunately our server had no clue how to actually serve people in a restaurant...we had to ask 3 times for napkins and when they were finally brought to the table, she acted as if she was doing us a Big Favor. Then after our food was brought to the table and we asked multiple times for eating utensils. The first time we asked her we were polite, then asked another server, then when we asked at the hostess stand we were told \""oh we told your waitress to bring them\"". When she finally brought them to our table she said \""if you had asked nicely I would have brought them sooner\"". Can you believe that!!! The floor manager came over and while he apologized, also made excuses for her confrontational behavior. \n5 stars for food and food prep, 0 stars for rude service or lack of service."
"1","Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.\n\nHere's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. \n\nI had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. \n\nAll in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. \n\nSave your money and try somewhere else. \n\nPS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world."
"1","I have been to Rolands a few times and have not experienced any of the problems others are saying they have, however, I'm only giving 2 stars because you're in the strip-you can do better than Rolands! I was most recently at Rolands during the steeler season last year. I ordered the crab chowder which I have had every time I have been there and each time it has been excellent. On this most recent visit I ordered the raspberry maple scallop appetizer as my meal. It was a large portion;I could not finish it and my fellow diners were too stuffed to help me. One member of my group ordered the seafood pizza and crushed it-said it was so tasty. My other fellow diner order the stuffed banana pepper app and also said it was good. They have a wide draft selection and if you get there early enough you can grab a seat near the tvs. The bar is usually too crowded to grab a seat at but our service at our table was attentive and quick. On a previous visit, I split a margarita pizza and it was good too so there is a variety of entrees/apps etc to choose from to please any palate."
"1","Poor excuse for seafood!   The place is overrated.  Good place to have drinks on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon-but that's about it.  The employees are anything but friendly. Unless you sit at the bar, the service is poor. Isn't even that great at the bar.  If you want good seafood, go a couple blocks up the street to Luke Wholeys.  So much better quality!  This place is definitely not for those with sophisticated palates!"
"1","The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District"
"2","I'm surprised Roland's has such bad reviews. I've never had anything bad here. Their lobster rolls are very good and you get a large portion of lobster in it. The clam chowder is good, their seafood pizza is awesome. I honestly have never had a complaint about their food. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is the service is usually pretty slow. Even when we go when not a lot of customers are there, the service still seems to be slow. I would definitely go back."
"1","Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, and ten minutes prior to painting I still had not received mine. On top of that, there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. When we told him I'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Will not be coming back to this place unless I'm dragged."
"1","Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit."
"1","I think one star is being HIGHLY generous for this restaurant. My family and I visited Roland's on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. It was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. My husband and I both ordered the Lobster Rolls and I order my daughter pasta from the kids menu. It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came, my husband and I both got our sandwiches, but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all, and trying to calm her down, we were giving her our food so that she had something, but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager, and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food). \n\nDon't waste your time here, especially if you have kids. The staff (minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasn't her fault) are a bunch of bozos."
"1","Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day, and ordered the \""famous\"" lobster roll.  It took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast.  THATS IT!  Oh and less than stellar fries, with a cup of cole slaw.  I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...I guess you can't get it right every time."
"2","We were shopping on a cold day in the Strip District and decided to try this place for lunch because of the sign advertising the hot lobster roll. It was pretty empty; a few early drinkers at the bar and a few couples seated at tables. I ordered a bloody mary which honestly tasted weird, so I'm not sure what was going on there. For food, we ordered clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a fish sandwich. The clam chowder was really tasty with good consistency and was a huge serving, much larger than we expected. The hot lobster roll was rich, buttery, and warm, and the lobster was good and fresh. The fish sandwich was gigantic... two huge fillets breaded and fried with tons of french fries. It was a little greasy but pretty tasty. Overall, I was happy with lunch and with the service and I would probably go again for the lobster roll or the clam chowder."
"1","Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes \""whoops.\"" and tosses it on the floor!! \n\nFast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.)\nFirst off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \""busy.\"" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza. \nThank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED."
"1","Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive!\n\nHowever, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better."
"2","My family owns a coffee plantation in PR, and visiting this place reminds me of all the scents brought about by the roasting process and all the aromas different coffee beans can exude.  Without a doubt it is a great stop for both Coffee and Tea lovers.\n\nI don't get down to Market Square as often as I'd like, but when I do, there's always a stop at Nicholas Coffee Co.  Great quality, and awesome products."
"2","For a moment I will need you to ignore my name. Okay good, now that you have ignored it, let's talk about how freaking awesome this place \""Nicholas Coffee\"" is in Market Square. \n\nYeah I know what you are thinking, \""well you are just saying that because it's like your name\"" Wrong. You ignored my name as mentioned above so you know now there is no bias. \n\nMoving on. If you ever wanted really dive into coffee, please go here. For Pittsburgh it's basically the epicenter of caffeine. You walk in and can feel the roasted beans scurry up your nostrils to only have you feel delighted as you now bath in its smooth roasted goodness.\n\nThe downside here is there is really nowhere to sit and it's really just meant as a place to stop in and leave as oppose to hang around. \n\nThe upside is there is SO MUCH coffee to choose from. It will blow your freaking mind/ melt your brain. Whichever comes first.\n\nIf you really love coffee, come here. Mediocre coffee drinkers beware."
"2","If you're a coffee drinker, this is the spot for you. I believe in freedom of choice, and i'll defend with my life your right to choose. But if you're going to drink coffee, drink coffee, not the flavored foo-foo stuff.\n\nMy first visit here was before Yelp was just a glint in it's founder's father's eye. And i listened as an old man (The founder?) was telling me about the old days, and how many men died when coffee roasters would catch fire and explode. Not sure how true those stories were, but hey, he was an old man, and I was fresh out of college. Like most college students my common sense eventually came back, but that's another story.\n\nWell he took me back and showed me the raw beans, and how they roasted them. It was very interesting. Then he made me a cup of coffee with bean just out of the roaster, slightly cooled, he ground them in front of me, then put them in a french press and let it steep for 4 minutes. Damn, that was the best cup of Joe I ever had. So the very next day I bought a french press, went back to Nicholas Coffee, and bought a pound of espresso roast and I've been hooked every since.\n\nThere are many places to get coffee in this city, but this place is the tops on my list!"
"2","One of the best places to buy coffee in the city. The Raspberry Truffle Latte is my personal favorite, but be sure to try their other speciality drinks that they post. Great location (Market Square), great environment and atmosphere, and friendly and helpful staff. Get a cuppa!"
"2","When I worked downtown years ago, Nicholas Coffee was the \""nuts\"" so to speak.   \n\nNow that I'm back working in town again, I was ecstatic that I can get a fresh cup of fabulous flavored coffee every morning as I walk to work through Market Square.\n\nIf you are a high maintenance coffee person, this is the place for you!  The flavored coffee is the BEST, one can immediately taste the difference from the brews here and the nauseating Hazelnut that is sold at every other place that sells coffee.  That flavor should be banished from the Earth, but that's another story.\n\nTry the Graham Cracker, Chocolate Orange, Almond Joy or Coconut, delicious!  Nicholas also carries freshly baked biscotti in a variety of flavors as well as other eclectic baked goods. \n\nA must stop for visiting guests and coffee/tea lovers!"
"2","Just bought a latte and child's hot chocolate, and both were good and the smell of the place is awesome... I coffee beans!"
"2","Great coffee and Tea selection.  Good prices for latte's, cappuccino, ect..."
"1","I knew it was going to be a fail as I watched the 'Barista' slopping together a latte for the customer in front of me.  I ordered a coffee of the day instead--meh, I've had better.  My wife got a soy latte:  he dumped the milk in, without technique, and over-heated the milk.  It was a watery, soppy mess.  \n\nWe want Nicholas to be great--or now, better.  Train the staff!"
"2","This place is located in the Market District of downtown Pittsburgh. First of all, when you walk in the smell of gourmet coffee is delicious! They sell gourmet coffees and teas as well as extras like honey that is specifically for tea, rare candies and I believe cigars.\n\nThis also serves as a small coffee house and roasting facility. Just to give you an idea of what the patrons think, it's located right across the plaza from the local Starbucks and the line was longer here than Starbucks! Surprising.\n\nThe inside of the shop is clean and well organized. You definitely don't mind waiting in line in a room that smells this good! The staff seemed relatively well informed and courteous. I can't speak to how well trained they are because I didn't have them prepare me a drink. I had gone to Starbucks."
"2","Wide variety on coffee & teas - even cigars. Relaxed atmosphere & friendly people.  Lots of flavored coffees, though I'm not a huge fan flavored coffees."
"2","This hidden gem, tucked away in the corner of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, offers more than just coffee.  Sure, it's easy to be lazy and unadventurous and go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, but why not take a chance and support a Pittsburgh staple since the 1800s?  They must be doing something right to stay around that long.  They also roast their beans in-house...in Market Square.  Amazing.\n\nNicholas Coffee Co. has a unique ambiance.  I'd say it's vintage bookstore chic, but your opinion and description may differ.  With a HUGE selection of coffee, fresh baked goods from local vendors,  friendly staff, and a humidor for the casual cigar aficionado, there's a little something for everyone.  \n\nThe coffee by the cup is very reasonably priced, and you can buy coffee in bulk, or buy a few sample packs to find your favorite brew before buying by the pound."
"1","I'd heard good reviews, so I stopped in last time I was downtown, but I'm not impressed by their coffee. Dark roasted, bitter, etc. If I'm looking for coffee downtown, I'd go find that 21st St. Coffee branch instead. Still, they sell a bunch of other neat snacks and stuff, and it beats a chain."
"1","The owner, Nicholas G Nicholas needs to attend a few driving classes before he kills someone. Maybe too much hp for him. If you see an 08 white porsche with FL plate 917 MNC stay clear. Guy drives like a nut. Almost ran me off the road in Boca Raton by 95."
"1","This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Unfortunately, Mike & Tony's closes by 6pm. You won't get good service, you will get frozen french fries tossed in the deep fryer served in disappointingly small portions. You will have to scrounge around for a bottle of ketchup and hot sauce. However, the gyro meat is freshly cut off the spit, and the over-stuffed sandwich is a good deal at $4.30. \n\nOverall, there aren't that many cheap places open at night downtown, so go here if you're stranded and can't stand the thought of another Sammy's corned beef sandwich. Otherwise, hold out for one of downtown's great lunch spots."
"1","You get what you pay for. Cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal. When stepping into the restaurant the first thing I noticed were glass cases storing food. It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal, which is a good deal. The fries were cooked to perfection, but lacked flavor. I had to dump salt on them, which is never a good thing unless you as for unsalted fries. The gyro itself was mediocre. The ingredients inside were fresh and made to order, but I did have to use a knife and fork to eat it as the pita was just a bit too small of the large mass of the contents. The slice of chocolate cake, while a descent size, was rather tasteless. The icing was pretty good, but the cake itself had almost no flavor, perhaps freezer burn. It did seem as if the cake had been frozen. I also felt like the harried girl taking orders behind the counter was overworked. She apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables. I kind of felt bad for her. \n\nOverall, I'd go here if I worked a block away and only had a half hour lunch break. Quick and cheap as a fast food joint, but not delicious enough as a dinner."
"2","I go here almost weekly. You can get a huge grilled chicken salad with bread and tzatiki for $6.25. Absolutely worth it for the money."
"1","The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Downtown.  They are open late hours, so sometimes that can be handy.  There are better places for Greek food, but Salonika's is often close by."
"2","I like their gyro salad. It tastes very good with the pita bread. Good portion. I don't get hungry later afternoon."
"1","I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note, i seen the Google street view car downtown :)\n\nAnyways, my gyro just wasnt that good. It seemed smaller than any other gyro in town, the fries were just frozen potatoes with no flavor and it just wasn't a very awesome experience.\n\nAlso, almost $9 for a small gyro, frozen fries & a small drink is not a \""deal\"". M&Ts is $7.50- same fries of course  but a large, delicious gyro.  I dunno, I've heard great things about this place but i'll stick with my regular oll Zorba's for downtown or M&Ts afterhours."
"1","I have been here several times in the last year. The food is average...kind of fast-food-like. It sits in the warmer cases, and looks \""crusty\"". The gyros are average, not as good as the ones at the South Side gyro restaurant, by any means.  The salads are from a bag of pre-chopped lettuce, and not \""fresh\"" or interesting. \n\nBut in order to enjoy the average food, you have to get past the really rude food wait staff.  The bartenders seem to be OK, the clientele in the bar seem to be regulars, and it is a \""cheap drink\"" attraction to some downtown locals. \n\nThe staff that serves the food, and takes the orders are out of this world rude. There is one that wins the prize for insulting the customers, and after having endured her, I will never, ever return. Owners should know how they are being represented at the front register. The man that cooks and plates the food is oblivious, or just is used to hearing her speak to people with such a lack of respect, that he is just deaf to it. \n\nGo somewhere else. It is cheap food, and you get what you pay for. I would pay twice as much, to feel like the staff gave a crap that I was there supporting their jobs."
"1","Just got a small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich and a cup of chicken chili from the Fifth Avenue store, and paid over $9. You can get much better quality and value elsewhere in Pittsburgh."
"2","Looks shady, tastes great. Lunch for under $5 a person and you walk out stuffed. What a deal!\n\nService is fast and friendly. Prices are fair for pizza anywhere, let alone downtown.\n\nWhen we walked in the door, we were the only customers. Combined with the dated decor, we weren't sure that we had made the right decision. We sat down, ordered a pizza and it was served within 15 minutes. By the time we left, the place was packed with only a few open seats left so it would appear that the secret is out."
"2","Delicious home made authentic italian classics.  Low prices.  Extremely generous portions.  For the same price as a Jimmy John's sandwich or Moe's Burrito, you can have a expertly prepared Italian feast with all fresh ingredients.\n\nWhy not a 5?  The service can be slow during the lunch rush, and the interior is a bit run down.  If you aren't in a crazy rush, your money won't go farther for better food anywhere in Market Square."
"1","I hated it! \nFirst, when I reach there the server showed me a table at the door. I asked for another location because it was cold... His answer.... Why? followed with an arrogant face!!! \nOK!!!! We finally sited in another place.... The salad came... It was ok... Nothing special... The entree... Please.... I can cook better... The lamb was sooo ordinary... \n\nSince I was in Pittsburgh for a meeting, I ask to the same old \""gentleman\"" that was serving us for a itemized ticket ( to be reimbursed by university). Whole sh....!!!! \nHis answer: this is the receipt, I can give you nothing else! You can write by yourself what you ate and show to them.... The only restaurant that gave me so rude, unprofessional answer ever!!!! \nIt is not everything... I just took my things and I was moving out when the same \""gentleman\"" say loud: THE TIP WAS NOT INCLUDE!!!! Oh my god.... Should I really tell him how much he deserved? But, I took a deep breath and some bucks from my pocket, and give to him... Saying sorry with my mouth, but shov.... it!!!! With my eyes!!!! \n\nPlease, if you go to there... Cross the street, you find a nice Indian cuisine. Five steps ahead, Cambodian. Three steps back, a nice cafe. Better, Six Penn at the corner..."
"1","This place looked hopeful for authentic Mediterranean but the food just didn't live up to any expecation. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Cafe Milano."
"1","Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf."
"2","3.5 Stars\n\nChristos is a sort of charmingly run-down sort of place, particularly given that many of the other offerings in the Cultural District are pretty new joints.  The food is better than average.  Having just eaten at DC's supposedly cheapest and best Greek restaurant the week I was in Pittsburgh, I found the food to be more authentic, better seasoned, fresher and definitely cheaper.\n\nWe had a group of 10 on a Sunday night.  The restaurant owner/manager/old Greek guy came out onto the sidewalk as we were walking by and practically begged us to come in.\n\nI had a grilled fish dish that was nicely cooked along with a glass of the house red wine.  At the end of our meals we decided we had to try the famous \""Jackie O cake,\"" which was, sad to say, nothing particularly special.\n\nBest of all, we had no problems splitting the check multiple ways when it came time to leave."
"1","Dirty, unclean, my friend and I went to lunch here.  She went to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to the table had the following story to tell.  \n\nTo get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs.\n\n When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood. \n\n Christos you get no second chances after a stunt like that.  The food was tasty, but come on now chicken chillen on the counter is a no go in anyone's kitchen."
"1","This can be summed up as follows: For Greek food, go to Salonika directly across the street. \nThis place is below par in just about every way. The prices are not high, but the servers seem more like salesmen in pressuring you to add dessert, etc. (At lunch?). I haven't been impressed by the food after numerous tries, and the atmosphere is dated and dingy. \nI would much rather go across the street at a place with no pretensions (counter service) and pay for honest food that I can see being prepared."
"1","The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff, although nice, was very salesy always trying to \""add on\"" something in a pushy way. \n\nI asked for my check and barely ate anything. I think the waiter got his ego bruised because he decided to display his \""Best In City\"" award right behind my head as I was still sitting at the table... a shame the award was from 2005! I guess a lot changed in 7 years?\n\nDon't bother with this place!"
"2","The food here is authentic and tasty and the place itself is a gem of kitch. Do not go here if you want a fine dining experience. The servers are odd, but that's part of the experience. The dining room may be cluttered with old photos, objects representing Greek culture and other oddities, but again that's part of the charm. The food is really, really good and I believe it is very well priced for what you get. \n\nThey also have this amazing soup that seems to have magical powers when it comes to curing a cold. Fabulous!"
"1","This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the \""homemade\"" wine, both white and red, kinda like adult kool-aid  and the Jackie O cake was great. My issue was the price, $59. for dinner for 2. For this price, I would have expected more.I can't believe the 4 and 5 star reviews that I have read on this site. It's hard to believe that this place rates so many opposing reviews. I will never go back here again."
"2","Excellent everything! Classic family-run Greek restaurant. Home made everything, including great family-made Greek wine. Inexpensive and authentic. Christos, the owner is hospitable and welcoming. I come from NYC, and I say this is right on par with the Greek food back home."
"1","Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter, which was horrible. The gyro meat wasn't off the spick, the dolmades were the worst thing ever eaten in my life and they charged us 4.00 to split it which we didn't even ask for in the first place. The only pleasant thing about this place was the cook who ended up serving us our food after our waiter went out for what seemed like a drug deal. Over all, everything was bad and I would never return and would advice everyone else to do the same."
"1","So....I read the reviews on Yelp & Urban Spoon.\nMostly negative, but hey I was hungry and gave it a shot.\nIt's true the place is dingy & like entering a Greek grandfather's home. \nI was first asked  if I wanted huumus. I declined that after reading is was mediocre at best. So I tried the $5.25 saganaki. It came out in an old brown dish with what looked like rubber floating in lemon juice and oil. * The owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra.\nIt tasted WORSE than it looked (if that was possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy. * I have had many saganaki in various countries. This ranked as one of the VERY worst! I made the best decision to leave before food poisoning set in. Bottom line:  HORRIFIC !!!"
"2","Magic happens at this restaurant. Beautiful family, beautiful service, wonderful food (and wine).\n\nWe love you Monica!!!!\nLove always, your friends in CA"
"1","So our intentions were to eat at the Indian place across the street however a lady ran across the street and started rattling off the menu as we were walking. At first I liked her moxy, but soon realized that if this is how they need to bring in customers we may be in trouble. Another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in. Our dinner conversation was constantly interrupted by the servers yelling across the street and on the side walk at potential customers. \n\nNow on to the food:\n\nI ordered the chicken kabob. Very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled. I didn't finish it.  The rice was good and the side veggies weren't bad. The spinach pie was ok. \n\nThey will ask \""would you like hummus to snack on before your meal\"". This is not free or included. I figured this so I wasn't caught off guard. Some people I could see will be surprised at the end when they get the bill. \n\nMy wife got the lamb kabob. Bland again and very chewy. It didn't taste fresh, almost frozen at one point and microwaved. The cheese pie was pretty bad.\n\nHummus was ok. \n\n2 stars for the food\n3 stars for service\n1 star for the experience with yelling and fishing for customers. Seems like they may be in trouble financially and could be cutting corners to stay afloat. \n\nI will not go again. Alihan's next door is amazing, I recommend them over Christo's every day."
"1","WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \""sure...\"" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\n\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. \n\nThe rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \""sure\"" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\""I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\"" I couldn't let my guard down.\n\nWe ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \""leg of lamb\"" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \""leg of lamb\"" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \""tried\"" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. \n\nWhen we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.\n\nYou've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nOwners like this will say,\""But I have to or else I won't make it.\"" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy. Maybe a long time ago when they started they were real but now they are doing every dirty trick in the book to nickel and dime you.  \n\nWARNING. DO NOT GO HERE."
"1","This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling, and overbearing greek man outside a restaurant door preying on the weak and indecisive. Something in the air of this place comes off as so fundamentally strange, and almost, discomforting and nightmare-like. You are going to feel uneasy, is what I'm trying to say. \n\n- They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't have itemized receipts. \n- The waiter kept giving us options as if they were... free options that you're supposed to choose. We caught on when we specifically asked if they cost extra.\n- The elusive bathroom felt like we were descending down the staircase to hell. Better than nothing, I suppose.\n- The food.... oh my god. None of our food was good. In fact most of it was outright gross/uneatable. The hummus was decent, but... I can also get decent hummus at Trader Joe's. \n\nWe initially felt bad for these guys. A struggling business is always sad to see. But with all of the strange behavior, attempts to scam us, etc. that sympathy turned into a sense of understanding as to why this place isn't doing so well. \n\nIf the owners are reading this-- I'm sorry if my review came off harsh.. but really, please, rethink the way you are going about your business. I don't want you to fail, I want you to overcome this. Do it the right way, not the scummy way. I know you're trying, but try differently."
"1","Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips,  eggshells or paper and did not dissolve in the liquid but remained floating around.  This is a health hazard and needless to say, I will not be ordering from this establishment again.  As for the food, mediocre at best  The baklava was average, the mixed grille kabab (chicken and lamb) was okay, dry and chewy at times but overall edible.  The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it.  As for the cold combination, the tzatziki, one grape leaf, and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled.  The cr\u00e8me caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water, really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted, but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water."
"2","I come here every time I'm in Pittsburgh and always have a great time so I'm kind of confused as to why others say otherwise. The ambience is really nice-- it has an intimate, yet warm, homey feel to it, which is good if you want to go for a date or with your family. It is decorated with authentic old Greek photos which always make me feel at home (although I'm from Sicily!) The food is great every time I go there and SOO filling --I feel like I'm at home and my grandmother is stuffing me with food! I don't have to even mention the Jackie O as everyone is probably aware by now of how scrumdiddlyumptious it is! Will be in Pittsburgh soon so you'll know where to find me -- Christos!"
"1","Fettucini from a can, anyone? \n\nIf you like paying $10 for tasteless pasta and sauces, this is your place!\n\nStay away and never look back."
"1","terrible... terrible terrible terrible... funny, the food there reminded me of the end of Goodfellas where the guy ordered pasta in a restaurant and got watery noodles and ketchup... yeah, not too far off the mark here. \n\nlet me back up a bit first.... My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint."
"2","great place to just look around, but they serve food too. i saw the other reviews and they didnt like it. hmmmm. i loved their food. 2 can dine for 25 bucks and itss good."
"2","Spag Warehouse is the best value for money in the tri-state area.... damn good food!!"
"1","Service is lacking and food is mediocre. When I crave Italian this is not the first place I think of."
"1","Visited this place for the first time for a rehersal dinner. The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice, but parking was hard to find on a Friday night. We had a semi-large party (about 15-20 of us) and it took us well over 30 minutes to get seated. Clearly they knew we were coming, so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them.\n\nOnce we were finally seated, it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread, garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party, obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered \""The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna\"" and it certainly wasn't 15 layers, unless you count the loads of marinara on top as, say, 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate, don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay, but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal.\n\nMoving onto dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with \""espresso\"" drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks.\n\nFrom start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably, we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer, but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time, we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more. Good value as a customer, bad for a business who is trying to make money.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for some good authentic Italian, I would recommend going elsewhere."
"2","I've been here once, so this is sort of a \""first-impression\"" review.  I've always heard good things about the Spaghetti Warehouse, and I'm one to love a great dish of spaghetti and meatballs!\n\nA friend of mine had a buy-one-get-one coupon from the local newspaper, so the two of us ate for the price of one. Our bill, including tip, was $20. \n\nThe spaghetti I ordered was fabulous, but the lasagna my buddy ordered looked even better!  This lasagna was huge.   I love that you get bread and salad with your pasta dish.\n\nThe decor is pretty cool, and the place is large. Free parking was a plus!  The only complaint I would offer here is that our waitress seemed to be very disinterested in her job. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but she just wasn't very friendly.\n\nNonetheless, I'll go back!  Good food, good decor, generally good service!"
"1","Disappointed. That one word sums up our group of 15's experience at the Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant has been a Pittsburgh institution for so long; however, it left many in our group unsatisfied and hungry at the end. My mom ordered the roasted garlic shrimp and her dish was dry and the shrimp were over cooked to the point of too chewy. I ordered the chopped salad \""warehouse style\"" as my main entree and it was a big salad. Yet the veggies in the salad weren't fresh and the warm chicken was burnt and wilted the lettuce with its heat. I sent it back without eating it (at least the waitress was kind enough to take it off of our bill). My fiance got the lasagna and chicken parm off of the classic combo section of the menu and his chicken was ok but not great. The lasagna was good too. However, neither were great.  My aunt and father were unimpressed with their dishes as well but I'm not sure what they got so I can't speak to their food quality.\n\nAlso, it took us an hour after we ordered to receive our food and our food was cold. Granted, I understand we have a party of 15 BUT the restaurant was not packed by any stretch of the means. In fact the room we sat in had approximately 10 open tables. I can't speak to how filled the other rooms of the restaurant were though. But there should not have been a hour wait nor should we have gotten cold food as a result of it. \n\nWe have booked this restaurant for our rehearsal dinner for our wedding but, considering how poor the food was and how incredibly slow the service was (no fault of the waitress), we are looking to change our reservations to a different restaurant. We chose the Spaghetti Warehouse because it is close to the hotel where all of our guests for our wedding are staying. Given how slow the service was, we can't afford to be there til 10:30pm at night when we have to be up at 6am the next morning for a very long day. (Another reviewer said that their rehearsal dinner group took 3+ hours to get out of there).  \n\nJust my 2 cents.  I wish the food quality and service were better.  I'm glad we found it out now before the rehearsal dinner."
"1","Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!\n\nThe place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a \""fun\"" looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)\n\nDon't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.\n\nKeep driving to Bloomfield!"
"1","We have been coming here since it opened, but will not go back after our three last visits. It has gone downhill badly. Three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for 30 minutes. There was a waitress, but apparently she was new and only had the front half. I finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comp'ed our meals. The lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warm.\nTwo visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit, service was poor and food was fair.\nThe last visit last night was the third strike and SW is OUT! Very poor service and food. The drinks were all ice and refills were not timely. The server past our table many times, but she flew by each time like we were not there. The zucchini appetizer was good. We only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter. No ranch dressing...really! This is the Strip District after all with many stores for crying out loud. The food was very poor. The spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce. The fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce, as well. My Wild Mushroom and Chicken was not warm but tasted okay. We will NOT be going back. Olive Garden and Bravos in the North Hills will be getting our business from now on."
"1","Didn't think this was possible, but it's worse than Olive Garden...food was horrible and extremely overpriced, service was decidedly lacking....  Neat location with fun and interesting decor but I wouldn't eat there again."
"1","Yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  Our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  That being said, I cannot ever go back to this place again because of the amount of bugs I saw in such a short period of time.  All gnats and thankfully nothing worse but who knows what's going on in the kitchen?  Not just a stray gnat or two but dozens just swarmed our table.  I killed one with my bare hand on the table and another one bit me and drew a (spec) of blood. Disgusting. A \""manager\"" (looked like a bus boy if you ask me but what do I know) did come to talk to us about it after my waiter noticed me covering my food with my napkin but it didn't accomplish much, no free meal or anything.  I noticed other people moving to other parts of the restaurant to avoid these bugs too."
"1","Why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me.  I had read prior yelp reviews and I knew what I was getting myself into.  To make a long story short, I went here because I was with several other people that wanted to go here and I really had no choice.  Anyway, I ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken. The sauce was really disgusting. I found myself eating only the pieces of chicken breast.  I brought this meal home because my husband isn't as picky as I am, but he took two bites and got mad at me for not warning him how aweful this meal was.  I will not be eating with this group of people again if they choose to go here again."
"1","The food is horrible - how can you serve pasta and marinara sauce and not even toss the pasta in the sauce?  I truly received a pile of watery noodles with a ladle of sauce on top.\n\nActually, the name says it all.  While this place has an italian food menu, there isn't an italian bone in its body.  You feel as if you are being served italian food from an irish line cook.\n\nThe restaurant decor was really nice when they last decorated it in 1981, which was also the last time that they updated the menu."
"1","We went here recently right before a 2-day, 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load. The food was okay - probably what we should have expected for the low prices - but the service was horrible. It was not busy, but we could not get our waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed a refill and asked for one when she took our dinner order, and reminded her when our dinner arrived. We were finally able to flag her down 10 minutes later to remind her again. It also took about 20 minutes to get the check after we had FINISHED our entrees. I am sure that not all of the servers are that bad, but I'm not sure I will be back to find out."
"1","I walked in expecting a great experience. It has a great atmosphere. There was nothing wrong with our service, but the food was overpriced and pretty meh. I had the tiramisu which is one of my favorites to get and it was horrible. It tasted like it came out of a Walmart freezer on clearance. Won't be coming back anytime soon."
"1","Whatever happened to this place?  Seriously.  I remember when you couldn't even get in the door.  Now I walk in and feel like walking right back out.\n\nOverall, I've got no complaints about the food.  I think it's average and priced well.  The lasagna is top notch.  And having a private lot in the Strip District is nice.  I usually dine in but on my last two trips I was placing an order to go.  After the first time I should have learned my lesson and called ahead.  Never again.\n\nThe first time, I walked in and went to the bar area (as directed by the sign at the hostess station, not an actual person) to place my to go order.  But there was no one there.  It's funny, because waiters walk through the bar area and even use the bar to get drinks.  But it seems they don't like to actually wait on customers or even make eye contact.  After waiting way too long to even be acknowledged, my order was taken.  The waiter who ended up helping me, Andrae, apologized at least and was very nice.  I asked for two salads and he was happy to accomodate.  But then I waited again.  I'm not sure why my food took so long, but Andrae knew I had been waiting and threw in some extra bread.  Despite the wait, at least I felt like I Andrae took an interest in making sure I was taken care of and his apology was sincere.  \n\nSkip to the second time.  While I had bad memories of my last visit, I was hoping it was an isolated incident and gave Spaghetti Warehouse the benefit of the doubt.  Except....things were worst.  I start to wonder if there is ever an actual bartender.  But as I'm sitting at the bar, waiting once again for achknowledgement from an employee, there was not one but two managers conducting interviews in the bar area.  While this is happening, several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks.  Not one even looks in my direction, let alone ask if I need something.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt the interviews being conducted, but after a good ten minutes of waiting, I went to the hostess stand at the entrance.  I waited a minute or two before one of the waitresses who previously ignored me came out.  I was a little salty with her, I'll admit.  I explained that I had been waiting at the bar as the sign says but no one was there to take my order.  She said she could take my order and again, I was directed to wait at the bar.  Back at the bar, their interviews over, I spoke up to one of the managers about how I had been ignored.  She apologized and said she thought someone had waited on me.  She then offered to take my order which I told her was unnecessary because I had placed it with a waitress at the hostess stand.  A few minutes later, the manager came up to tell me that she had deducted $10 from my bill and apologized again.  I wasn't expecting that, but at least it was an admission of their poor customer service.  However when I received my to-go bag, I only found one salad and one loaf of bread.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is....beware when placing to-go orders.  It's probably best to call ahead.  The service here is hit or miss on a daily basis, but definitely beyond a miss when trying to get food to go."
"1","This was the first time my husband and I have been here. We went with my sister-in-law, her boyfriend, and his sister as it is a tradition to go around Christmas for the boyfriend's family. Well, we were not impressed at all. Even the bf wasn't happy this time. We didnt have the best waitress as she would run off too quickly.for us to say much and we thought forgot about us the drinks took so long. She finally showed and said she had dropped them and had to make them again. We ordered and the wait wasn't too terribly bad for the food being a Saturday night in Pittsburgh though it was after 7 when we arrived. I didn't care much for.the garlicky butter that came with the sourdough, but the bread was hot and fresh.\n\nA balloon artist came around and made a flamingo that had to be 4 feet tall for the bf's sister and a little penguin for the SIL. He later came back, unasked, and gave her a 2 ft penguin with a hockey stick and puck in its \""hands'. \n\nWe finally got our soup, which did take a while to come out. Three of.us had the wedding soup and none of us liked it. The SIL's bf said it didn't even taste like wedding soup, but like chicken soup with meatballs. Granted I've been a little stuffy lately, but the broth barely tasted like wedding soup broth to me either.\n\nI had the fettucine alfredo, which was ok. I ate more of it than I might have were I not eating for two right now.  I added pepper because it was rather plain...not even a garnish. My husband said his spaghetti and meatballs was just ok. The bf had ordered an Italian Margarita I believe it was called and drank the first one though it wasn't mixed right as you could taste the tequila and there was no salt. He even added sugar trying to improve it. The second he gave back and the waitress didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. She went into the kitchen and started complaining loudly and our table was near the kitchen. Then she shows up with the check and we had to wait for her to come back to split it 3 ways since there was 2 couples and one other at the table. The bad drink was still there and my SIL was thoroughly pissed by then and went to talk to the manager and told him about overhearing her and all he did was take the one drink off. I noticed while reading our check that the entrees were correct, but that she had us as having a salad and minestrone when we both had wedding soup. I didn't say anything since the price was the same.\n\nThe balloons artist was great, but we won't be going back just to see him."
"1","Spaghetti Warehouse THEFT!!!!!  \nLet me just state I wish I could give it a less than one star review.\n\nHere's a story for everyone, do with it what you will:\n\nLast Saturday, I go to Spaghetti Warehouse for the murder mystery dinner. After leaving, I realize I forgot my scarf. I call back and ask the person who answers the phone, mind you her name was Stephanie, and I only remembered that because..weird that's my name, to go look for it. Stephanie gets back on the phone says she found it and will put it aside for me. Now I meant to get back there the next day, Sunday, however with my busy life I wasn't able to get back until today, Saturday. \n\nThis is exactly one week later, I go in the afternoon, when it's not busy and waited for about 20 minutes for them to look for my scarf. Now mind you, they don't have a designated location for lost and found stuff, when I suggested that, the hostess told me that people don't normally leave stuff. YEAAA, because I'm sure I'm the only on in Spaghetti Warehouse history to leave an item behind. \n\nAfter 20 minutes passes, I have 2 managers talking to me, one of which says he knows the girl who found it, and he called her and left a message when there was no answer. The other manager told me he knows nothing about it and can't do anything until they speak to that employee. I asked when the employee would be back, and was told this afternoon. I also asked what happens when they can't find my scarf (at this point I'm assuming an employee stole it) and was told that we would cross that bridge when and if it comes to it.\n\nSix hours elapse, now I'm thinking to myself, even if this girl was not suppose to come in tonight she would at least call her employer back, right? Well I call the Spaghetti Warehouse to talk to the one manager, and low and behold Stephanie answers the phone. I'm told I can't talk to a manager because they are really busy at the moment. Strike 2, there should always be a manager on call and able to talk to customers at any point in time. I say nevermind I'll be down. \n\nHead down to Spaghetti Warehouse for the second time today, this time with my friend who was with me the night of the dinner. She goes in first as a set up asking for something completely different from that night, Stephanie admits to only finding a scarf. So I follow suit and come in, the other hostess who helped me early says they still didn't find it. That's funny Stephanie just said she found it. The manager who I spoke to earlier comes out to talk to me, in the lobby of the busy dinner rush. Doesn't pull me aside and proceeds to argue with me in front of customers.  He had zero resolutions prepared, and does not come up with one until after told we would file charges and call the better business bureau. Finally, the best excuse that he can come up with is that, someone must've thrown it away. EXCUSE ME! \n\nSo, if I accidentally left something behind, and called to ask for it to be put aside, someone throws it away?! After being threatened with criminal charges, and calling the better business bureau he finally comes up with a resolution. If I have the receipt I can bring it down and they will reimburse me, what if I can't find the receipt? Well then you can you go buy another one, and the bring the receipt and we will reimburse you. Ok, so I have to take time out of my day to go to buy a scarf (in hopes they still have the same one!) and then bring it back down here in order to get my money back, and not to mention waste gas driving back and forth. Ends up just giving me the $20 on the spot. Which still isn't the point of all this, your employee stole, you didn't even think to question it when that employee is standing 5 feet away, oh and the couple beside us heard the entire argument, and the lobby was told not to leave anything behind because they will steal it or throw it away. Isn't the customer always right?\n\nWILL NEVER GO TO THE SPAGHETTI WAREHOUSE AGAIN IN MY LIFE OUT OF PRINCIPAL! AND THE FOOD ISN'T EVEN GOOD!!"
"1","This place is dead, but they just don't know it yet.  \n\nArrived on a rainy Wednesday around 7PM.  20 minute wait for a table, so I guess they are doing well, right?  We should have known better when we sat in the bar area to wait (me, my spouse, and my eight-year-old son) after the rather apathetic front-desk person took our name.  A couple tables taken, but no sign of staff in the bar.  Every table was dirty, covered with plates, glasses, and the remains of others.  We took one that had just a couple of glasses and an impressive amount of Parmesan cheese scattered about.  Took 10 minutes for any sign of a bartender, who promptly spent five minutes getting caught up on drink orders before wandering over.  No smile, no welcome, just \""what do you want, and are you waiting for a table\"".  And certainly no \""let me clean this table for you\"".  We had a beer and a wine and a root beer for the little one.  The pinot grigio was vile, but, hey, thanks for charging us for the more expensive version: lord knows how disgusting the cheaper version would have been.   Finally, after 20 minutes we were seated.  Not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period.\n\nAnd the restaurant is empty!  Maybe 20% full!  They made us wait simply because they can't staff correctly.  Acres of empty tables.  So we sit, look at the menu, check out the surrounding (few) tables and made the only good decision we made this night:  we left and found another place in the area.  A place that actually worked to seat us and made us feel welcome.\n\nThe most amazing thing:  between the greeter, the bartender, and the seater, there was not a single smile.  Not a single sign that they actually are happy that we chose their establishment.  And not a sign that that they gave a damn whether we ever wanted to come back.  No wonder it is 80% empty but still makes people wait.\n\nThe other reviews compare this to Olive Garden and the like.  As my review makes clear, I can't compare the food.  And I am certainly not a fan of the Olive Garden.  But the few times I have gone into one, I was made to feel welcome.  Certainly not here.  \n\nThe place is living off memories:  I don't think it is creating any new (positive) ones."
"2","Surprisingly peaceful...not overly packed packed wit customers considering it was 1pm on Monday...\n\nLocated minutes from the Strip District...sufficient parking available on the side...had to wait several minutes to be seated cuz no hostess was available...\n\nDecor was eclectic ...brings u back to the days of the \""phone booth\""...i wouldn't know them days...lol :)\n\nThe food was amazing :) the salmon was juicy and tasty...but wasn't a fan of the green paste on top... Fettuccine Alfredo was average...no different from fettuccine Alfredo from other restaurants... What really stood out was the soups...we had wedding and minestrone ...both were very hearty...and full of flavor ...\n\nWaitress was friendly and timely and lunch times prices can't be beat considering their big portions :)"
"1","I went to the Spaghetti Warehouse on a Sunday afternoon.   It was for a late lunch (about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived).  We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car).  It's a visually interesting place to dine.  However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. \n\nThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).  And yet although there wasn't a lot of other customers there all vying for the attention of the servers, it took an unusually long time for our waitress to arrive at our table.  (A pattern which continued throughout the duration of our stay).   \n\nOn the back of the menu, there is a section for lunch entrees.  I ordered the \""Amazing 15 Layer Lasagne\"".   The three other people in my party all ordered the spaghetti with meatballs.   The food was...okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I've been eating Italian food for almost five decades.  And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   \n\nBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   \n\nI HATE being ripped off.  And any restaurant which does that kind of crap is RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.   So congratulations, Spaghetti Warehouse.  You got the better of me.  And I will never, ever go there again."
"1","You can't screw up pasta--it would be very hard.  Only Buca di Beppo has managed to do that, and they did it by drowning the pasta in salt and charging through the nose for it.\n\nThe food here is pretty darn good.  I love the bread they bring to your table and the atmosphere is very fun.\n\nMy problem is that the past four times I've been here, the service was awful.  Tonight our waiter brought our bread and salads before our drinks and this was only a huge problem bc I was dying of thirst.  \n\nOur waiter (Vincent) had 3 tables.  It was like he was trained not to bring our table anything unless hte other two tables needed something.  He would disappear for 20 minutes at a time (I'm not kidding).  I gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order.  He came out with entrees for the one table, salads for the other, and bread for our table.  Why would you not just get our drinks?  You can come back to the table multiple times!!!\n\nThis has happened the past four times I dined here, and I'm just over the awful service.  Too bad I won't be back, bc I wanted to love this restaurant.\n\nGood food, AWFUL service.  2 stars bc I love carbs so damn much."
"1","I wanted to like it here... in fact, I have in the past. We used to come here for college events and schedule ahead of time for a large group - then again, this was always on weeknights... when they were slow... thank goodness. I always loved the food here (then again, these dishes aren't anything scientific - they are basic - comfort food), and I thought the gigantic restaurant could handle large groups well... until I brought 10 people here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday. \n\nFirst of all, we had reservations but still stood awkwardly in the waiting area for a while to be seated. Not terrible. Then we were seated - the server was flustered and irritated before we had a chance to speak. Long story short, we waited 1.5 hours for our food (pasta... yes - the stuff you make at home for an entire family in 10 minutes), the waitress spent all her time coming to her table bashing the kitchen staff to us (not exactly professional), and the manager was no where to be seen. C'mon, manager! It's your job to sail this ship - get it together. From my line of vision, I could see about 7 servers running around like chickens with their heads cut off doing nothing but throwing the kitchen staff under the bus. Dear manager: if you have this many employees standing around doing nothing but complaining, put a few of them to work in the kitchen. \n\nThe place is cute and I really want to like it again, but I probably won't return until the management learns how to... manage. True, this isn't Capital Grill, nor was I expecting 5-star service. In all honesty, I'm from the middle-of-nowhere Ohio. I didn't even know what fine dining was until college. It's just that I've had better service at Arby's on a Friday at 12 noon when they have a line 20 people deep and cars wrapped around the building 3 times in the drive-thru. \n\nSaving grace: the sangria was good... thankfully, because that's the only thing we consumed for 90 minutes while waiting on our luke-warm dinners to arrive."
"1","Arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday night, there was a 20 minute wait although although empty tables were visible.  Got seated at 7:30, put order in shortly thereafter.  We got bread and our soups fairly quickly then sat for an hour without any signs of food.  We looked around the restraint and it was obvious other tables had been waiting and we're getting frustrated.  The waitress apologized the kitchen was slow, so we gave it another 15 minutes before we finally walked out at 9:15 still hungry.  The food I saw looked good, but I would never recommend this place.  It doesn't take over an hour and a half to make a friggin salad and pasta."
"1","This is a one time visit. The worst service ever. It was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. The food was mediocre at best. The bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. Not even shaved cheese, nothing. Total waste of money. The lasagna that they claim is so great in my opinion was diner quality, and that might insult some great diners."
"1","It has been years sense we visited the spaghetti warehouse, my husband and I couldn't remember why we haven't been back. We had purchased a groupon for this place and decided to try it for an early dinner... Our first step in the restaurant and then it hit us on why we haven't returned.. The odd smell hits you at first step in the restaurant , you look around in the foyer and you see weird and dilapidated pictures, a candy stand that probably hasn't been used in years.. We get seated in a booth with one side ripped and the other side stained, our waitress was nice but that is far as she went. The food is mediocre at best, the bread and the endless salad was the saving grace of dinner... We wanted to enjoy this place and tried to have a good time, we would not recommend this place to anyone... There are plenty of other good restaurants in the strip and in lawrenceville.."
"1","Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  There were 4 of us and I don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled, it was a slow weeknight as well.  So yes that could have just been bad luck with the waitress, but food is sub-par and atmosphere is well.\nI suppose this is a good dining option in some situations, but there are so many other places in the area, and I guess this was just nothing to write home about for me."
"1","I had spaghetti warehouse delivered to my apt and I ordered spaghetti and meatballs while my boyfriend ordered chicken Parmesan. First off, we both asked for Caesar salads (which we paid extra for) and we didn't even get them. Besides that, the sauce was less than mediocre - a glorified ketchup with noodles. The chicken was dry and we couldn't eat half of the meals. Overall, very poor experience with spaghetti warehouse. You're better off getting fast food noodles from noodles and company. Seriously disappointed especially since it is called the SPAGHETTI warehouse. Very hard to mess up spaghetti."
"1","DO NOT GO HERE! They are understaffed, incompetent,  and slow. It was like getting waited on by 1st job people. The place smells like bleach. It's tacky too hot. They play pop music and it's supposed to be an Italian place. Not one person there ever smiled and I was treated like a body in a chair not a person wanting to enjoy a meal. Very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals. I suggest eating out of a seafood dumpster if you plan on going here."
"1","Im soo surprised with the food that we ate. Im from California and was excited to experience this restaurant. Especially, since it is a local fav. I ordered the house made spaghetti expecting a fresh tomato base sauce. Unfortunately what I got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions. It had no...flavor!  Now maybe I ruined the meal by ordering gluten free noodles....but I didnt think that would make it this bad. Im soo sorry because our server was awesome and they even accommodated our big party. On a good note, the bread was delicious.\nAs much as I hate Olive Garden...I would preferred that."
"1","A long long time ago in a far away place, I used to go to a place called Spaghetti Warehouse that was cool, clean, had good service, and had really good food. But that place is gone and now I'm left at this place that is dirty, has horrible service, and mediocre food. The end. Never coming back."
"1","No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate."
"1","Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55."
"2","love their drinks and they have good food. the staff is friendly and take out is prepared correctly and quickly. Costco has gift cards that cost less than the face value so you can really get more bang for your buck!"
"1","Ordered delivery. The food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable, as it's (just) within the delivery window specified. However, the food had apparently been prepared within 15 minutes of receiving our order, because it was cold by the time we got it. I didn't listen to the other reviews and paid the price (literally)... if someone else is saved a crappy SW dinner by this review, my meal (or lack thereof) will not have been in vain."
"1","Worst place ever.  I took my friend there for the first time and my son.  We waited a hour for food.  The waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  The reason they messed up the order.  We talked to the manager I'm assuming which didn't really care.  Said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. Never again. Unprofessional and rude"
"1","Our terrible experience began with a 45 minute wait only to find half the tables empty and the table behind us being consoled by the manager after their own bad experience. We hopped this was a one off and not typical. Our waiter was prompt but very aloof, but we all have off days. The food was mostly bland and flavorless to the point we could not finish it.  This is where things took a turn for the worse, as our order was being boxed up it fell on the floor. Despite our insistence we did not want another the overcompensating manager brought it anyway. We passed it on to the party behind us, maybe they took it home and added some seasoning, it needs it. Avoid this place at all costs!"
"1","Ewww, the food here is terrible.  Nothing I had tasted good.  It tasted like it had been sitting under the food warmers for hours.  The service is luke warm at best.  Just skip it.  There's so many other places out there for good italian food."
"1","We went on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but it was likely closer to 45-50 minutes. \n\nThe food is just average. Nothing special. Didn't seem handmade or anything like that. I thought they were known for their lasagna...so I got that. Blah...average.\n\nService was incredibly slow. I don't think the waiter checked on us once.\n\nI probably wouldn't go back.\n\nVisited October 2014"
"1","We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two, as our dinner entree. The Calamari was uneatable and the Ravioli was just down right nasty. The wedding soup was the worst I have ever had. The meat balls had absolute no taste, kind of like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted no different than Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might have had 15 layers but 12 of them were noodles and sauce, you had to search for any meat or cheese. Our garlic bread came out literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We will not be back."
"1","I stopped in here with my family the day before Thanksgiving. My sister, niece, and parents were at the Children's Museum and were struck by a fit of nostalgia--my mom used to take us here when we were kids. Either the whole operation has gone severely downhill, or I was too young to notice how bad it all is.\n\nBetween all of us, we ordered chicken Alfredo, lasagna, and cheese ravioli. Every dish had several things wrong with it. The chicken was likely cooked the week before in a dirty cafeteria then shipped to the Strip District. It was dry and looked reconstituted. The ravioli were lukewarm at best, and my sister said the lasagna tasted microwaved. Even the bread was stale.\n\nOur waitress was also forgetful and a bit cold. I didn't get a salad I ordered, dishes stayed on the table fifteen or twenty minutes after being empty, and water refills were inconsistent. As a former server myself, I'd like to think I know what is in one's control and what is out of one's control. This woman was simply not up to snuff.\n\nWith Lidia's right down Smallman Street, I have no idea how the Warehouse is staying in business. Spend a few extra dollars and go there. It'll be worth it."
"2","Looks like it's time to update another review of mine. I once said I had never had a bad experience at this place. Buuuut things have gone downhill a little at the Warehouse since then, so I suppose it's time to update my original statement.\n\nWhile the food here is still some of my favorite comfort food in the city (I certainly won't pretend it's genuine Italian), in the last couple of years things have really slowed down at the Warehouse. At my last visit they were so severely understaffed that I waited about 20 - 30 minutes to be seated, even though I remember seeing open tables during my wait. This isn't to say that the staff didn't do the best they could during that night - in fact the poor girl who handled my table was very clearly doing her best to rush from table to table without dropping anything. And a manager even came out to apologize and bring me drinks because our poor waitress was handling so many tables. So they definitely earned some goodwill back with that.\n\nIt helps that the food hasn't let me down yet - it always comes out cooked well and seasoned well, and I always enjoy every bite. Sure, it's probably not what Italian die-hards are looking for, but it is a chain restaurant and it does a very good job once you consider that. I will continue to stop in for delicious glasses of sangria and huge portions of pasta and other \""Italian\"" comfort foods - but only on days I'm not in a rush; and hopefully the trend of slower service and not calling in enough people to work won't last forever."
"2","The Exhibits were few but there were some powerful ones and some funny ones. All really modern even in how they were presented. A cool shop - definitely a place to buy home decor items or gifts. It was worth stopping in especially since it was free. It adds a good dimension to a trip to the strip. I definitelly recommend it. There is probably at least one thing here in for every type of person."
"2","I was standing on a corner eating my Peace, Love, Donuts donuts and thought I noticed signage for crafts. This word-\""crafts\""-can mean many things and with sticky, crossed fingers I darted across the busy intersection to investigate.\n\nI think the best place to enter this gallery is from 21st ST. This entrance leads you into the shop, or \""the Store,\"" which is what my review is mostly focused on. \n\nSo, back to \""crafts.\"" There are really talented contemporary artists featured here and the Store is a great place to get contemporary pieces for you, your home or for gifts. I bought two Brett Freund (PA artists) ceramic pieces and they were so beautifully wrapped I felt guilty they were only for me. Prices are varied, depending on size and medium and of course the artist. Whatever your budget, this \""gift shop\"" (another term I hate) is a must to check out. \n\nOne thing to note, I was there on Sunday, which neither the gallery or Shop should have been open on, so I'm not sure what was going on that day. The gallery was indeed closed, rather, roped off for the trading of exhibits but what I could see was exciting. This is definitely on the list to check out when I return."
"2","There is nothing really to complain about here.  This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It's definitely for the expense account crowd.  It's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I've been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It's like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm, Ruth's, Capital Grille, etc.).  The bar is pretty lame, but I'm guessing most go here for a sit down dinner.  Capital Grille or Hyde Park bar is much better for bar scene.  But, one thing I definitely appreciate about the bar is  the bar menu.  If you've never been to Mortons and you are watching your budget go to the bar have a cold beer and order the PRIME cheeseburger trio or the Filet sandwiches for only 6 DOLLARS.  Plus, the fries are awesome.  The dining room is really nice with dark wood and lots of leather.  The service is awesome because I'm guessing you have to be pretty good to land a server position that might end up paying you 6 figures.  The food is great.  However, my opinion is that most true high end steakhouses all have similiar quality steak.  I eat here a few times a year and my favorite first courses are the lobster bisque (Very good, but not as good as capital grille) and the tuna tartare.  Stay away from the filet.  I mean it's tender and delicious, but try a steak with a little flavor.  I'm guessing if you're like me you don't go to Mortons often, so try something that  is hard to get elsewhere.  Get the Cajun ribeye.  I can't remember if Pittsburgh location does a bone in ribeye, but if they do I would say a cajun bone in ribeye will be one of the best if not the best steaks you ever try.  I also suggest getting the \""lazy\"" lobster.  There are few things in life more indulgent or enjoyable than having a two pound lobster cooked perfectly already cracked for you.  It's pure indulgence.  The asparagus is great and as big as a baseball bat.  The spinach is great and the hash browns are a must have.  You should definitely save room for desert and there is no better desert here than the chocolate souffle'.  Remember to tell them that is what you want for desert when you order your entrees.  I wish the bar was better, because if it was I'd go here more often.  This place is exactly what you would expect.  And, that's a good thing."
"2","The food is awesome. Nice atmosphere. Come in on happy-hour that you can get oysters for $2 and colossal shrimps for $2.25 at the bar. They are a must-try."
"1","I know I'm a steak snob but I found this Mortons perfectly adequate. The service was just okay. We asked our waiter for a recommendation on a side dish and he not only forgot to bring it but also what we ordered!  And you think they were bottling it themselves when we asked for a second bottle of wine. The only saving grace was the chocolate mousse which was a little cup of whipped heaven."
"2","Great dining experience if you pay the right price!\n\nDare I say this is the best steakhouse in Pittsburgh?  I've been to several Mortons, and at this location at least 4 or 5 times.  It lives up to any other Morton's I've been to - the experience is pretty consistent across the chain.  They have a great deal on their website called \""Steak and Seafood for 2 for $109.99\"" that includes:\n\nLoaf of Signature Bread\n2 Salads (Morton's or Caesar)\nVeggie to Share\nPotato To Share\n2 Single Cut Fillets (additional selection at additional price)\n2 Seafood Accompaniments\n2 Desserts\n\nAs you can see, the amount of food is a lot, and it can easily be shared by three. We had the fourth member of our party order Al a Carte and the bill was under $200 with tax and tip out the door. The service is great and the food, unbelievable. No one does a filet mignon as great as Morton's, and their Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake is to die for.\n\nSo, if the price is right ($50 a person or so), I say by all means, go here! If it's a special event, such as a birthday, etc. they put \""Happy Birthday, ______\"" on the menu without even being asked to do so and take a picture of the entire group. It a great experience and we love going to Morton's!"
"1","I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off, we sat at the booth near where the host has his podium.  He seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable.  \n\nI did like the nice touch of having my name printed on the menu and service by our waitress was good.  However, food wise, it was just OK and a bit disappointing.  I of course had filet, and I was just so underwhelmed with it.  The flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring.  \n\nAfter this experience, I have no desire to ever come to this restaurant again."
"2","Morton's is one of my all time favorite steakhouses. We have been to this location on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed. \n\nTo start, we've had the raw bar appetizer which is always fresh and delicious. I always order the filet mignon medium rare, while my husband will change up what he gets. The sides are huge and made for sharing. The creamed spinach is yummy, the baked potato is huge, the hashed brown potatoes are nice and crispy but I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. \n\nThe key lime pie is delicious and the legendary hot chocolate cake melts in your mouth but the souffl\u00e9 for two is always a winner. \n\nAlso, don't worry about parking because they have valet up front."
"1","Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.\nThey are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. \nGone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.\nI just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America."
"2","I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. \nThe environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended."
"1","We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati, and were eagerly looking forward to a sumptious dinner at Morton's in Pittsburgh. Oh boy. The ambiance is more like a Wendy's that tries to be upscale: cramped, busy, somewhat noisy. Of the two filet mignons we had (different sizes, medium rare) one was horribly overcooked, the other one a little on the rare side. The meat wasn't special. The deserts were OK but the Creme Brulee was bland in the extreme. Service was OK but occasionally inattentive. For two adults, one child, a check of $150 would have been reasonable for the quality provided. It ended up being $350 or so. Oh well - I rounded up the check to $400 and left with the intention of never coming back again. Imagine my shock when I found that my credit card had been charged with $600! I'm sure this will turn out to be an innocent mistake, but if this restaurant thinks it provides an experience worth $200 per head, they need to call Chef Ramsey."
"2","After originally writing this review for Open Table, and not until it was completed was I informed that it had to be trimmed to a brief highlight before it would be posted. FAIL OPEN TABLE REVIEWS!\n\nMorton's The Steakhouse, to the average joe, is a special occasion treat. It's prices are out of this world, especially when everything is a la carte. The restaurant-going public at large has gotten used to dining where choosing an entree entitles you to choose soup or salad, a vegetable and a starch. I've been here before, so I know not to expect anything with my steak besides a plate and flatware. Oh, and a napkin (and to be totally honest, bread and a glass, complete with water).\n\nHowever, since the star of the show here is steak, it's almost sacrilege to choose anything else. C'mon, the speciality of the house is right there in the restaurant's name! I went with the \""Signature Cut New York Strip.\"" To be totally frank, it is quite possibly the best steak on the face of the planet. It comes with a beautiful char, perfectly cooked to perfection, with nary a blemish to be found. You will be using your knife, but never to cut away grizzle or fat. How does a steak taste this good, chew this well, and not have any fat vein? Not quite sure, but Morty seems to have it down to a science. My companion had the \""Center Cut Prime Ribeye\"" and she agreed with my assessment of perfection.\n\nI saw many of the apps and sides being delivered to other tables, but after a soup (which I will describe in a moment) and steak, who could eat so much. The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail app looked tantalizing, old-school style on a wide-rimmed glass, complete with dry-iced fog effects. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese looked tempting, and were large enough to feed a group, but I can't attest to the flavor.\n\nWe started with a loaf of exceptional warm bread with flecks of toasted onion on the crust. It had a wonderful crumb, and I'd buy it from a bakery in a heartbeat. To begin I started with the Lobster Bisque, and my companion began with a Center-Cut Iceberg, or wedge salad. The wedge seemed perfectly adequate, inspire of it's Flintstones size. We both agreed that the Lobster Bisque was sublime! It had an incredible depth of lobster stock flavor. Speaking only for myself, though the bisque is the main attraction, the lobster island usually found floating in the middle is akin to the cherry topping an ice cream sundae. And I save it for the final sayonara spoonfuls. And in this case, it actually took down with it what went before. It was so overcooked as to be inedible, and rarely is ANYTHING inedible to moi. It had the mouthfeel of an underdone sponge, or perhaps soggy cotton balls. What a disappointment! I really couldn't tell if it was over or underdone.\n\nSo that last payoff, combined with the waiter's never-ending push to inflate the bill with dining accoutrements, were the only demerits from an otherwise exceptional meal!"
"1","This is definitely an old school hang out with a classic menu.   Although my steak was cooked perfectly,  I can't speak to the quality of the ingredients as they lacked natural flavour of meat and fish that I love.   My biggest gripe, though, would be the overcooked scallops.  If you are an adventure Eater or like common things cooked in uncommon ways, I would skip this one."
"1","We made a reservation and were told that seating was on time, we waited 15 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. The food was awful, my pregnant fianc\u00e9 ordered a filet medium rare that came out medium well!  Who cooks a filet medium well?  My father-in-laws strip was so over seasoned he could barely eat it.  But since we waited over an hour for our food, he had to eat it.  Our reservation was for 8:15 and we did not eat until after 10:00.  We all ordered medium rare steaks and one lobster tail.  It should not take over an hour to prepare.  The filet was taken off the bill, however, that does not help the fact that a pregnant women had to wait so long to eat and when it came out she didn't even eat.  I shared mine with her as did her dad share his, but as mentioned above, his steak was awful too.  My Cajun ribeye was good and so was my mother-in-laws lobster.  We ordered chocolate souffl\u00e9 for dessert and it didn't even have chocolate on it.  It tasted like scrambled eggs with whipped cream.  I have to tell you that was by far one of the worst dining experiences we have had.  The four of us eat out together once a week and tend to go to more \""pricey\"" restaurants.  This was terrible and I am sure we do not plan on returning."
"2","Refined, classic style steak restaurant, Mortons will not disappoint those who are looking for a traditional upper end place. \n\nYards of linen, tons of silverware, and hordes of waiters make this place a must go in Pittsburgh.\n\nOur table of six enjoyed perfectly done steaks and fillets, beautiful accompaniments of vegetables and potatoes, great salads,  excellent desserts, along with an impressive wine offering.  \n\nExpect to pay heavily for this experience, it is well worth it."
"1","Wow, not so much.  I haven't been to a Morton's in years, but was happy to be going back for a business dinner.  I thought the service was exceptional, but the food was mediocre at best.  The filet that I ordered was cooked to perfection, a nice portion, and tender as can be -- but absolutely no taste.  Nothing.  Nothing discernible at all.  I can tell you that with all of the above and no taste, it was all for naught.  Unrelated and not the blame of the server, of course -- again, service was great -- one of my colleagues found a piece of hard plastic in his veal chop.  He thought the veal chop was great, but wasn't real excited about the plastic in his dish, which the server promptly removed from the bill.  I brought another colleague's salmon home with me and heated it up the next day.  Oddly enough, a beautiful piece of salmon -- absolutely NO flavor.  Very strange experience.  I doubt I'll ever return.  Coincidentally, the place was empty on a Thursday evening."
"1","How this place got 4 stars when there are so many better options in Pittsburgh is beyond me.  The only thing that was noteworthy about the experience here was the price. The food was bland. Nothing to write home about. The place looks uppity, but really the food is just ok. Go to Ruth's Chris instead."
"1","If you're not looking careful enough, you could miss New Sambok Oriental Foods on Penn. It's a very small Korean market, very hole-in-the-wall Strip storefront, on the corner of Penn and 18th St. \n\nThere is a decent selection of your typical Korean products, snacks, drinks, red pepper, ready made sides, and ramen. They sell kimchi which I bought once, to save time, and it didn't go to waste. If you're not used to old style Asian markets, you might have second thoughts about shopping here, it's a little on the dark side lighting wise, and small. \n\nOn the weekends, the owner cooks Korean snacks on the sidewalk in front of the store, my fave is the Korean pancake with kimchi sprouts. The owners are a friendly, older couple. Not the worst store I've ever been too, I've been to better. Can't complain too much since there isn't a large Korean population in Pittsburgh. Just be sure to look for best by dates, since turnover is probably pretty slow."
"2","I was first introduced to Korean food my freshman year in college. It was a match made in kimchi heaven. This love affair has now extended to the Korean culture and language. Sam Bok is the perfect venue to get anything Korean cuisine related and has some wonderful Ahjummas (ladies) who will let you try out you newly mastered though limited skills at speaking Korean. \n\nI love making my own kimchi chigae - not proficient enough to make my own kimchi though. Sam Bok sells really good cabbage and radish kimchi that you can pick up anytime. It's available in several sizes. I also like their black bean sauce, yam noodle packets, spices and spicy ramyun packets (Asian ramen that will blow your socks off). I recently picked up a couple of bread rolls with cream filling which is a Korean delicacy that satisfies your sweet and savory cravings. Sam Bok's bread was wonderful, I will definitely go back for more of those. \n\nI suggest giving Sam Bok a shot, it's unique, local and always inviting."
"2","As a grocery store, I'm not much of a fan. The grocery items here are way too expensive. The only thing I buy here is seaweed wrap, but other than that I avoid buying grocery here. \n\nThe one thing I love about this place is the hot street food in front of the store every weekend! I have tried everything: chicken on a stick, fried rice, egg rolls, vegetable lo mein and pancakes. Everything is well prepared, well seasoned and well cooked. \n\nOverall, I don't recommend the grocery store, but highly recommend the hot food if you're in the strip area and craving a quick, cheap snack."
"1","I am the dork-ie kid from your kindergarten  class. Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old , that would mean I have been wearing eye glasses for 20 years.  \n\nDo me , you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location.  The service is here so incredibly inconsistent.  I have nothing,  I mean nothing good do say about the service that I have received here .The eye glass assistants are rude.  The way you are treated is sub par.  America's Best (I even hesitate to use that name because it's obviously not the best in America) just sucks.  \n\n Due to my terrible eye site I have to spend EXTRA money for thin lens.  So normally what I do is,  once a year I shell out $200.00  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses, paying cash.  The frames are alright but nothing that great. \n\nBesides my lens not being great another thing I  have a problem with is the poor customer service. On more then one occasion through out the years I have been talked down to. \n\n I have been wearing my current prescription from AB for about 10 months. This prescription is not good for me, before I had a magnified prescription that made everything BIGGER. My poor little blind self I have an astingamstism in both eyes. Two years ago I got good lens with nice frames but in 2012  I got shit lens with an okay frame.  I don't plan on returning to America's Best , it's just not worth it."
"1","If you look at my Yelp reviews I NEVER give 1 star, but this was the worst costumer service experiences I've had in my entire life. The entire staff was rude. They made us feel like it was such an inconvenience. From lady at the reservation desk who frowned, snarled, and barked commands like we were in a prison, to the embittered woman who was supposed to help run our insurance information, this experience made me feel belittled and terrible. \n\nBefore arriving we checked with our insurance companies that America's Best would honor our insurance, but when we got there the lady said that they do not take our insurance. After BEGGING and PLEADING that they call our insurance company she finally did and while frowning told us that she was wrong and they America's Best actually did take our insurance. \n\nWe were so disgusted with our experience here. We called the corporate office (something I never do) afterward and told them that when are contacts arrive we will not go back to this location. The people at the corporate office were actually really nice and had them shipped to the North Hills location instead. When we went to pick out our contacts at North Hills the staff was very pleasant, but it was too little too late. The downtown office has ruined America's Best for me forever. Honestly, I have been telling everyone I know never to go to this sub par establishment."
"2","I'm used to going to a private practice in Columbus, Ohio for my glasses needs. But I've moved to Pittsburgh and needed some place economical . I booked my appt online the night before but showed up late.... I didn't know there was a marathon going on . I just wanted to get an exam so I could buy glasses online . The staff was nice and rescheduled me for the next slot. Everyone was nice including the doctor .  Although I didn't initially want glasses 2 pair for 100 bucks and a free eye exam is a great deal. Especially considering I usually spend 300 on glasses after insurance is said and done. My only complaint is the selection wasn't amazing but what so you expect for such cheap prices."
"1","From the previous reviews that I read I know exactly who people are talking about.  I rarely give a one or two stars. The customer service here is horrible.  I feel like everything I say is wrong.  I felt rushed when selecting my frames.  They changed me $10 more than what the price was marked on the frame.  When I pointed that out I got an attitude."
"1","Edit:  A customer service representative from the central office called me and was able to arrange a refund with the manager of the Pittsburgh location. Still, I think this location only deserves one star, considering one of their employees actually lied to me about the return policy, saying all sales were final, while another one said \""I don't know what you're talking about\"" when I tried to explain my problem. Very poor customer service at this location. \n\nDespite what it says on their website (30-day return policy), this location refuses to take returns, even for a defective product. I got a set of eyeglasses here which have reflections all across the field of vision. They're barely usable due to this. If I sit near a bright window, I have three reflections which show up in each lens.  These reflections go directly across the center of my field of vision.  $200 down the drain. Buyer beware."
"1","Ugh - so I went here this morning and while there was nothing wrong with the food (just got apple cinnamon oatmeal - review on that later) the cashier was bothering me.  I mean it's freaking 7:45 AM in the morning - just let me pay for my damn oatmeal and get to work!  \n\nThere was NO ONE else in line, therefore no one in front of me and I'm standing in front of the cashier waiting to pay...now get this...I'm standing there, debit card in hand, while she's completing a text message.  And it's not like she just needs to press \""send\"" oh no - there's is content getting written before my eyes as I wait there, and I'm thinking to myself is this really happening, who the hell could she be texting this early, and why the hell is she making me wait while she completes the content of a text message.  \n\nNow, I realize that ABP (Au Bon Pain) isn't some uber-professional establishment, but I'm thinking this should be in customer service 101 - stop texting while a customer is waiting to pay for item, you may resume texting after customer(s) are gone.  \n\nThe oatmeal was tasty - and I like that they have a self-serve topping area (containers filled with nuts, cranberries, raisins, brown sugar, granola).  They had a choice between plain and apple cinnamon oatmeal - I went for the apps cinn mush - good stuff.  If only they could train their employees better."
"2","I stepped into the Pennsylvanian as I was scouting wedding reception locations. There is really no space like it in Pittsburgh. \n\nIt sits on this little hill in the heart of Pittsburgh, the corner of Liberty and Grant. The giant rotunda is just magical and the grand hall is beautiful. There are offices in the back - which is annoying because the offices windows surround the grand hall. \n\nDownsides. Of all the venues I visited the staff was the most rigid - there are a ton of rules, no drapery (aka the office windows never go away), liability insurance, music off by 1130. \n\nNeedless to say I booked my reception there - I can work around the rules."
"1","I stayed at the Pennsylvanian for about a month in one of the Corporate Apartments.  This place is old.  I believe it used to be a hub for trains and buses.\n\nThe outside looks nice but the hallways to the rooms look a little dingy.  There was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub.  The washer and dryer was old.  There was rust on some of the door hinges.  The dresser, fixtures, coffee table, dining table, and dining chairs looked new and modern.  The carpet for the most part was clean.  The sofa looked old and was not comfortable.  The bedsheets had yellow stains on them.  I did not use the comforter and one of the layers.  The Pennsylvanian has a maid service option with 1 week or 2 week intervals.  I am not sure if they even changed or washed my bedsheets because they all had the same yellow stains?  wtf?\n\nThe views from the apartment is nice, but the windows are hard to see through since the window screens are dirty.\n\nThe kitchen is ok.  The corporate apartment comes with a fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots and pans.  There is also an iron and ironing board.  There is also a 22 inch? CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels.  I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay.  The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me.  They did not offer me a chance to pay for it.\n\nThe fitness room was nice.  There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines.  There are even a few sets of dumbells.  I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that.\n\nThere is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly.  There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company.  You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned.  This is rather expensive as well.  Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.  Thieves could come in and steal your clothes.\n\nIf I had an option, I would not stay at the Pennsylvanian again."
"1","Pros\n- Ambiance - Prettiest venue in downtown Pittsburgh\n- Space - you can fit a ton of people in the space!\n- Rania's Catering (required vendor and provided great service)\n\nCons\n- Sound - Due to the vaulted ceilings, we were never able to get good sound on the mics. There was an echo and most people could not understand anyone talking (MC's, Speeches, etc). Super disappointing not to hear your father or father in law's speech. :(\n\n- Management - The venue attracts well to do clientele, but the service does not match the price tag with high quality and accommodating management service. They are more like mean museum curators in the planning process. :) Hotels are far superior in management service.\n\n- Common Space is NOT Exclusive, Building Residents are Allowed to Join (and sometimes harass) -\nDuring dinner, my fiance, I, and the photographer went to the rotunda to take pictures. A resident came downstairs and started doing Tai Chi in the middle of my party. A 70 y/o man brought out a lawnchair and watched her. We held our tongue and ignored them, but the man shouted at us \""of all the places in Pittsburgh why do they have to take pictures on our property, and in our way?\"" . I told them we had rented the entire venue and it was actually private property, and they told Me to shut up. Me, the bride!\n\nIm not saying it was a situation of racism, but I wonder if they would have been as ugly, if I was a white bride in a white wedding dress. Instead of a foreign bride, in a red sari. \n\nMy father in law tried to pacify the situation and told everyone to just calm down. Then the old man stepped up to my new father in law in a aggressive way as if to make him flinch. I told them, \""I am the bride, why are you trying to ruin my wedding day?\""..response \""shut up B***, and go inside.\"" They were joined by another older couple that also chimed in with aggressive and angry language about how they lived there and I was on their private property as we cut our session short and walked back inside. I didn't know I had to hire security to protect myself from the Pennsylvanian residents. When they started behaving physically aggressive, my coordinator called the police. The angry senior citizens also told the police that my photographer (who never even spoke) instigated the situation. Afterwards, PA management did not take a side in the situation. \n\n-$$$$ Everything must be brought in from the outside. Tables, chairs, kitchen supplies, silverware"
"2","I find the Pittsburgh Saks to be friendlier than Saks in many other cities.\n\nIt's always a joy to talk to the people working at the perfume counter. They are very willing to let you sniff different kinds of perfumes; they patiently wait for you to make a decision; and they are perfectly pleasant even if your final decision is to not buy anything; they will still give you free samples if they have some.\n\nThe sales clerk in the dresses section is also helpful. I once had to buy a dress in a hurry, and the person assisting me picked out three candidates (all on sale) and offered me her honest opinion about which one looked good on me. No attitude at all.\n\nOverall, I find shopping at Saks a better experience than shopping at the Macy's nearby."
"2","I think someone at Sak's Corporate read my last review. They have rearranged and updated the men's floor! They moved the shoes to a more open and flowing location. They have also taken out the house ware section and have converted it into a Hugo Boss section that is huge! Louis Vuitton is now gone as of January 31, 2010 and was replace by a handbag wall. They left because Sak's wouldn't update their area. I am so sad to see them leave! They have a stand alone store in near by Ross Park Mall.\n\nNow if only they could redo the whole store."
"2","Fair well old friend. You will be greatly missed. After being in downtown Pittsburgh for 60 years, Saks Fifth Avenue is now closed. :("
"1","Don't waste your time.1- they dont sell regular paper and hardly have poster paper.2- its really hard to find any thing of use. Most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way.3- the owner is a bitch. During park(ing) day 2010 she waited 3 hours before coming out and telling the artist \"" i find what you are doing is discussing. I dont support your tree hugger shit....\"" extraordinarily rude."
"1","I went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad, which I thought would be a pretty standard item for a stationery store.  (Turns out I was wrong.)  The store was such a cramped, crowded mess that I had to ask for help to find what I was looking for, but was hesitant to do so because I felt so awkward interrupting the four employees sitting at a table in a corner, eating leftover pasta and engrossed in conversation, ignoring me and the several other customers who were browsing.  When I finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad, the workers all looked at each other as if to say \""Who's going to handle this?\"" before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that, as it turned out, \""didn't come in with the shipment\"".  As if Pittsburgh was a hot market for ink pads and they go through their entire supply every week."
"1","I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals, I went over to see the cat. The cat let me pet it and followed me around yowling for attention. I picked up the cat to hold and the man that works there was very rude and ripped the cat away from me. I will NEVER NEVER go back to a store that treats animals or animal lovers that way. The shop isn't that great anyway."
"2","Charming store with high quality items.  I've purchased business cards and placesetting cards. The staff was very attentive and detail oriented. Great customer service."
"1","Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest, most disdainful people who seemed almost gleeful for me to leave without purchasing something. I went in to purchase either some classy paper or a unique card to write a note to a homeowner to whom I was considering placing a purchase offer for their house. It's a stationary store, so I didn't think my request was unusual. The products there were outdated, in many cases even dusty, overpriced (which honestly, I would have paid a local business if the product had been unique and quality), and disorganized. I was asked if I needed help, to which I replied yes and explained my situation, and a very curt man stood in a back corner and pointed to various corners of the store and said, \""Look there and there and there and there,\"" AND THEN HE WALKED OUT OF THE STORE.\n\nI'll seriously never step foot in Weldin's again, and felt it necessary to post publicly about the experience. Such a shame.\n\nBTW, I found a delightful card next door at CVS. It was made of wood. Very unique. Go figure. ;)"
"1","I have been a customer of this store many, many times in the past.  I go there ONLY because they are the only source of yarn in the downtown area and I'm an avid knitter.  I put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this.  I was actually a little excited when they moved because I was looking forward to visiting a clean store.  \nHere is where my mistake happened.  I recommended them to a coworker.  She just called to ask where they had moved too (I was unsure of the address and it's not on their website or here on yelp).  When she asked the woman how ansered the phone if she could tell her where they moved the woman hesitated and said, yes I guess.  I'm sure she thought we was being funny.  Then she simply said they were located in the Gulf Tower.  When my coworker asked where that was the woman LAUGHED at her and said in a very rude tone, on Grant street.  My coworker has only lived in Pittsburgh for a year, as you all know PIttsburgh is not the easist city to learn.  When pressed for further information about the location the woman had the nerve to raise her tone of voice and tell my coworker that the building had only been there for 100 years!\nSad, very, very sad.  They are absolutly DESTROYING their reputation!"
"2","Calzones are excellent. Highly recommended, very filling and cheap. Pizza is good but not great. Can't beat the price in downtown Pittsburgh, 16 inch for $10.50. Been here four times in two weeks"
"2","Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries!"
"1","Not worth your money.  Poor service, worn interior, A/C was non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK.\n\nThey get two start because they managed to get us from Point A to Point B without making us fear for our lives."
"2","You just gotta have a Peppi's hoagie...especially on your way to a Steelers game.  The guy stands under the bridge near Reedsdale shouting, \""Peppi's.....hoagies....\""  They are damn good.  Talk it into the stadium and enjoy :)"
"1","I found a short black curly hair in my basket of fries... and it was definitely not mine.\n\nNeedless to say, this completely ruined my meal. Thanks to Peppi's, I won't be eating anything that isn't ready-to-eat as is (like fruit) for the next few days.\n\nNot only does the shop LOOK grimey, it IS grimey... Completely disgusted."
"2","Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.\n\nThis place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!\n\nWell, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it \""plus an egg\"". The \""plus an egg\"" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.\n\nPlus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... \""plus an egg\"". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there."
"2","Best Espresso Hands down. Makes me want to hop on a plane and come home for a weekend just to wake up on a Sunday and hear italian men next to me while I sip my espresso machiatto."
"2","It's actually not bad! Scared by the lattes at their CMU site last year, I have been hastened to come to La Prima. \nSince I am now creating a latte in PGH list, it is somewhat unfair to not come giving them a chance at all.\nI am actually not disappointed by the cap I got here, nutty and mild. It's a bit too dark roasted for me in that I cannot really taste/smell the characteristics of the beans, but nothing obviously disappointing in general. :)\nThe environment is not that welcoming for staying."
"1","I went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great. Well I can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink. I was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there, but instead all I got a was blank stare. \n\nThe coffee shop down the street had great coffe and they don't drop anything in there as well."
"2","One of my good friends introduced me to La  Prima back in the late 90's.  They had storefront on liberty  between what I believe was a movie rental joint and  an indie theater.  Simply amazing terra cotta type ceiling... \n\nHaving recently visited the strip district location. I can confirm that 10 years later the coffee is still frigging amazing.  \n\nI'd describe the house blend as unique, and balanced. Sumatra  bold but not overbearing.  And you'll need to check another review for latte frappa cappuccino."
"2","The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere, the neighborhood feel, the baristas, and the patrons (especially the little Italian men sitting outside playing cards drink espressos). A huge favorite place in my book!!!"
"2","La Prima is an excellent, no nonsense coffee shop.  It gets very crowded on Saturdays, but I always try to stop in for a double espresso.  You're not going to want to bring your computer."
"2","I don't have much of a taste for coffee, I'll pretty much down anything that slightly resembles it and I'll be content. \n\nI've heard told that this place sold the \""best coffee in pittsburgh\"" I had to test it out for myself. So on a bright day wandering around the strip, we decided to go to La Prima for some morning coffee. I was blown away by how packed it was, the line extended to the front of the store and there was barely any room. People were anxious to get their caffeine fix and I was anxious to try some of their coffee. Once inside you can see that there is a pastry store adjacent to La Prima (not a bad business idea) and while I did not try the pastries, there seemed to be a lot of happy customers pouring out of the store. \n\nFinally, the coffee. The coffee was better than average (which must be pretty damn good because I can't taste quality coffee). I gulped down my cappuccino as fast as humanly possible. It was a great start to a great day at the Strip. I would recommend taking your coffee lover friend here, they will surely appreciate the quality. \n\nNote: While they do sell the coffee at La Gourmadine, it does taste better freshly brewed here."
"1","Out of 200 reviews, I've written only 14 1 star reviews.  that's .07%.  That means I never really write 1 star reviews.  La Prima Espresso in the Strip District gets one.  :(\n\nThey've got a good coffee but I will never be back, bc the older woman who is the barista in the morning was unforgivably rude, without reason.\n\nThe coffee is good, I would have liked to become a regular, but I dont want to start every morning dealing with her nasty attitude.  Yesterday she rolled her eyes at me when I asked for lots of room for cream.\n\nI am a former barista.  I *know* asking for room for cream is not one of the more difficult special requests she gets!  If you hate the public, you shouldn't work with them.\n\nThis morning takes the cake, and I just won't be back.  Here's what happened:  \n\nI walked in, and she was talking to a gentleman who was obviously a regular.  Because she was busy and bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently.\n\nAnd waited and waited.  It was a few minutes, but an eternity when you really need coffee!\n\nShe never even looked at me.  Then all of a sudden she goes, \""Okay lady are you going to stand there or do you want coffee?\""  \n\nWTF.  I liked her sense of urgency, but seriously?  Rude.\n\nI asked for a medium coffee in a large cup, or if that's not possible, a medium coffee with lots of room. \n\nNot hearing me, she goes, \""What was that?\"" and the older gentleman said, \""She wants a medium sized coffee in a large cup.\""  And the woman turns to me and snaps, \""And you couldn't repeat that yourself?\""\n\nEven the guy she was talking to, her regular, was like, \""Whoa.\""  He tried to make some excuse for her, like, \""She's just fired up today!\""  Then the woman slams my coffee down on the counter.  \n\nWas she having a bad day?  Am I the doppleganger of someone she hates?  I dont know, I don't care.  I believe she may be the owner because surely she should have been fired by now, as there are other posts with complaints about her. \n\n\""Do not go here during the week if you expect them to open on time. I was there today and it was 615am and there was no employees at all. Managed very poorly. The older lady with a short hair cut is the one who doesn't open on time when she is scheduled. Please move this lady to a different time. 6am is too early for her.\""\n\n I won't ever be back.  If that's just her spunky personality, well, her personality sucks.  \n\nSeriously lady, you're not a morning person.  You should ask for later shifts."
"1","Oh how sad. \n\nFull of younger kids who don't really know that gay doesn't need to be synonymous with slutty or bitchy. \n\nBig dance floor area, and a bar quartered off by a chain link fence (for real). Sigh. \n\nKind of what you don't want a gay bar to be."
"1","Basically, if you don't need a fake ID to get in/aren't interested in pedophilia ... don't bother."
"1","We used to call this place Tons of Sluts.\nBecause pretty much, that's what it is.  \nThere's a fence that fences you into the bar... it's.. ridiculous. \nIt's not cheap.\nI only went for drag shows.  But if you're looking for a wild drag show and cheap drinks head to Blue Moon in L-Ville on Butler Street"
"2","I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it, even if they've never stepped foot in it. Pegasus was an amazing bar/club to go to to dance, socialize and roam their 3-4 floors. The dance floor was spacious and there were so many places to go if you grew tired of dancing! I never had one bad night at Pegasus! Every night there was an amazing adventure! The staff was great and the people there were so much fun! I met some great people there and the crowd was almost always friendly and fun. I really hope that Pegasus comes back because Pittsburgh needs it!"
"2","I've been coming to this salon for about 8 years now and have never had an issue.  I have to suggest my own hairdresser JoJo, who does a fantastic job working with my curly hair.  It's always nice to chat and joke around with her while you're getting beautified!\n\nOther services I've had done are nails and waxing, which have also been a great experience.  A Brazilian wax may never be a comfortable thing to go through, but I've been seeing Amy and she has always tried to make ripping out hair as painless as possible:)\n\nAll the people who work there are incredibly friendly, and make you feel very comfortable while you're there....even offering up the owners homemade red wine to sip while they style!"
"2","After years of hoping from one hair salon to the next, I finally settled on Cardamone's. This salon caters to customers of all ages and types from Downtown businessmen to students at the nearby Point Park University. The styling tools and products are top of the line and always leave my hair with a beautiful finish. The staff are very friendly, especially my stylist Marisa."
"1","I'd had a nail appointment set for several weeks - a first time customer.  Less than an hour before the appointment I got a call canceling it.  Not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow, but from the nail tech.  She told me the owner insisted that SHE call her clients herself to tell them she had \""personal problems\"" that day and couldn't make it.  Wow.  The lack of professionalism astounded me.  \n\nOn the positive side, I'm glad I had the experience BEFORE what may have been the worst nail experience of my life.  Imagine how the \""personal problems\"" may have affected the work.  I called the salon to let them know of my disappointment in being left high and dry.  They simply didn't care.  They lost a customer....not just for nails, but for all the other services they offer.  Not the best way to run a \""service\"" business!"
"2","We came here to see the play \""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!\"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat, the waitress was never too far and the food was satisfying. We really had a great time and enjoyed watching a play while eating and drinking. Great time and we can't wait to come back for another show."
"2","Excellent casual business lunches - salads, sandwiches - always freshly prepared and consistent quality.  Family owned."
"2","The only Chinese supermarket in Pittsburgh. Thank goodness it's well stocked. Unfortunately it's a 30 minute bus ride from school and hauling the goods back is not easy. I feel most at home here, it even smells Asian!"
"2","Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!"
"2","Pittsburgh is unusually lacking any good Asian grocers. This was the closest I could find and compared to the ones in Philadelphia this can't even compete. However, considering that it's Pittsburgh, this is probably the best Asian store around. \nWhile the location is a little far I am willing to trek all the way to Lotus for a few ingredients that only they have in stock! It holds all sorts of miscellaneous food stuffs that I am always dying to try. \n\nThe prices are pretty good and I always leave spending 10 dollars less than I thought I'd spend. \n\nThey have tofu there that is really really cheap! It is also a little questionable how they serve it but, I've never denied myself some discount tofu. \n\nWhile the baked goods there temptingly cheap - they are not fresh so I'd stay away from those. \n\nOverall I'd say that I need to go for another lotus run"
"2","A good store to pick up your East Asian cooking ingredients. There is a large selection of sauces, oils, and noodles. They also carry rice which you can buy in bulk. The freezer section is quite large, but I'm not too sure about what sort of freezer goods they sell. They also have produce which is on par with the other vendors in the strip. Lastly, there is a small fresh fish section in the back."
"1","After an unpleasant experience at Lotus Grocery on 17 February 2014, I want to caution customers to be careful when paying with cash at the store.  \n\nMy order was $3.08.  I gave the glum and cold middle aged female cashier $10.10.  She put the $10 bill in the till and gave me $2.02 change, which would have been correct had I given her a $5 bill.  I told her that I gave her a ten dollar bill, and she repeatedly insisted that I did not.\n\nI went to the mean middle aged man who appears to be manager or owner and told him of the problem.  He was not interested in hearing it and it eventually fell into the lap of a short, middle aged woman who also appears to be manager, and is one of the nicer people on the staff.\n\nI got nowhere until I asked that a count of the register receipts.  The woman who  appears to be in management suggested that I leave my phone number and that I would be called after the store closes and a count is completed. That was not acceptable to me. I asked that a count be conducted while I waited and she agreed.  As she counted and recounted, I waited patiently.  She ultimately concluded that I was right and gave me my $5.00.  She apologized multiple times; the clerk who would have cheated me out of $5 did not.\n\nI will be careful when shopping at this store.  I will try to pay with one dollar bills in the future and will announce how much money I am handing to the cashier. There is a bitter taste in my mouth about Lotus Grocery.  Of all places for this to happen, it would have to be one where there is a language barrier and where most of the employees are dismissive of the customer.  This is not Giant Eagle!"
"2","This is hands-down the best Asian grocery I have visited in Pittsburgh. It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store, it is outrageously cheap--$1 for 3 pieces (3 pieces = about 1 & 1/2 blocks of packaged tofu) They have a great section of Asian-style noodles, snacks, and sauces, with the brand variety you will never get at a typical grocery store. They also have a really good selection of fresh produce that is hard to find in other stores.\n\nBe warned, the products do not always have English translations. This doesn't mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means you might make a few mistakes on the way. The store clerks are usually not very helpful because 1) this place runs on a very small staff and everyone is always busy, and 2) many of the employees don't speak English very well. The small staff is part of the reason this place is so cheap, so cut them a break. As for the language barrier--it's a traditional Asian grocery store, so yes, English is not their first language; don't be surprised. I don't consider these detriments because this store perfectly suits my needs. It is definitely not an introductory course in Asian cuisine, so don't expect anyone to hold your hand. But if you know what you are looking for, or if you are just feeling adventurous and willing to make a few mistakes, this place is worth a look."
"1","If I can give haft a star I would. Never shop at this Asian grocery since Many more open. Owner and employee alike no manners and nasty. Sorry guys it's the truth."
"2","Love this store! It absolutely stinks, but the prices and the foods you find here you won't be able to find anywhere else. Has the best sweet chili sauce. Beware though, rarely anything has english labels on it."
"2","I realized today that everyone should have a good tailor!  That realization came about from a trip to the lovely LuLu....\n\nI had an adorable vintage dress I had bought in Chicago last summer that was too large in all the wrong places and I kept putting off getting fixed.  I had a seamstress friend look at it and she was even stumped by the darts on the chest and how to exactly go about fixing it.  \n\nLuLu had be try the dress on and did a few simple markings and I was on my way.  She even encouraged me to make it a bit shorter, which I was on the fence about, but ultimately decided to do once she pinned it up.  I think a day or two later (after she had told me a week) she called to tell me it was done.  \n\nLet me tell you, the woman knows her way around a seam!  She worked her magic on that dress so that if fit be like a glove... it as beautiful!  I looked closer and could tell that she completely took apart the bodice to remake it so it fit me in the chest.  But she still kept the look of the dress so that the change was slight and still fit the style.  \n\nNow I'm mentally going through my closet thinking of all the things I'm excited to have her custom fit for me!  And of course, visit LuLu again, because she's so so sweet!\n\nNOTE: CASH ONLY!"
"2","I needed a sweater rewoven and Lulu did an awesome job.  She was apologetic about being backed up wtih work, but I wasn't in a hurry. Pricing is very reasonable and she is very competent with her work.  I would highly recommend this business."
"2","I can't even begin to describe how happy I am with the service I just received. I'm leaving tomorrow for a trip to San Fran and need a suit for a special dinner. I'm a thin guy, so it's really difficult finding a suit that fits me. I brought the suit here (thanks for many positive reviews from Yelp) to have it fit me better. It was just too big. I was aware going in that they weren't going to make it fit exactly perfect and they surely exceeded my expectations.\n\nWhen I showed up on Friday, the two women (mother and daughter) were so kind and warm. They got right to making the marks in which they were going to fix and made me feel so welcome. I wanted the suit back by Tuesday (now that I think of it that was very unrealistic considering it's prom season) and they weren't sure if they could do it. When I explained my situation, they agreed and fit me in. I was so happy! They were my lifeline to not having a baggy suit to this fancy dinner. \n\nWhen I went to pick up it today, it wasn't even touched and wasn't ready. The daughter was so sorry that it made me feel bad! She then went and started working on it right then and there. I couldn't believe it! THIS is customer service, people! Within an hour (enough time for me to grab lunch and fill up my tank) my suit was done and better than I expected. She even patched up a little hole for me! She also mentioned that her machine broke right in the middle so she had to finish by hand. Is it the perfect suit for my body, no. However, she truly made the most of what it could be and for that I'm thankful. I've never had such great interaction with a business before, from the small talk we shared to the service they provided. \n\nI will recommend this place to ANYBODY and will use them in the future. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"2","We were in pursuit of a simple pant leg alteration.  \n\nLulu is super sweet and clearly highly in demand (especially for re weaving and re knitting items).  It appears she does most of reweaving and her mom helps out with more simple alterations and such.  \n\nPants were hemmed well and it was good work.  We have already gone back with another clothing repair.  I would fully trust Lulu and her shop with any alteration we would need in the future.  \n\nShe is located on the 5the floor of the Investment Building."
"1","As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor, I went with her to Jim Ludwig's a few weeks before her wedding to go over the final order for the flowers.  We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.  I don't understand how there was a \""miscommunication\"" as I saw the paperwork.  I just know that I won't be using Jim Ludwig's for any of my own special occassions."
"2","Jim Ludwig's did the flowers for my wedding, and we were extremely pleased with the whole process. The initial consultation was thorough, we received the proposal promptly afterward, it was easy to make revisions, and they were very responsive throughout. They delivered to three different locations for us on the morning of the wedding, and Jim personally pinned the boutonnieres on the groomsmen and handed the bouquets to the bridesmaids, and gave us buckets of water to refresh them with during the photos and had Tim meet us at the ceremony to trim the stems right before we walked down the aisle so the flowers would look their best. The centerpieces at the reception were gorgeous.\n\nWe've also used them for several bouquets on other special occasions, and they always do a great job - we can just tell them what we'd like to spend and they make suggestions and deliver the flowers promptly and looking great."
"2","My second time here.  Just purchased a Briggs & Riley briefcase.  Less than 1/2 price of a Tumi bag I looked at, but better.\n\nGreat selection, knowledgeable staff, good location.  They also repair luggage--even Tumi store won't do that.  If you're proud of being a Pittsburgher, you should be buying as much as you can from a _Pittsburgh_ store!"
"2","What a great store! Dean the owner/manager was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about which backpack was best for me.  Very generous 30-day return policy and a wide selection of travel accessories as well as luggage. A must visit if you need luggage and want to support local businesses, especially the few who are left Downtown."
"1","Specialty Luggage misrepresents customer service, does not make good on product warrantees, makes promises they do not keep and charges a premium for luggage that they falsely sell with lifetime warranties. I purchased a piece of luggage worth around $100 for almost $300 because the salesman convinced me that the luggage had a lifetime warranty. \n\nHe looked me in the eye and told me my luggage would be supported or replaced by them at any time.  He's a really good salesman - he smiles, makes you laugh and makes you feel like he's really honest. He'll go on for 10 to 15 minutes on the craftsmanship and quality behind the bags that they sell. \n\nHe'll make promises and guarantees to sell you a piece of luggage but in reality falls apart like any other luggage you purchase elsewhere without their excessive price \""service\"" premiums. \n\nWhen I went in with \""lifetime\"" warrantee luggage that he sold me that had defective wheels and a defective zipper that began disconnecting from the seams - he looked me in the eye and told me that I had a \""convenient\"" memory. He laughed at the idea that he told me there was a lifetime warranty on this luggage. I told him I was insulted that he misrepresented the craftsmanship behind this bag and overcharged me for a product that was not worth the premium he collected - he offered me 10% off another piece of luggage and said he was insulted. \n\nSpecialty luggage is staffed by slimy salesman who lie and misrepresent facts to sell you over priced products that do not justify the premiums they gauge customers for."
"2","This is a tiny place tucked into some snazzy downtown complex. Its cheap for downtown, and the portions are generous, so I suggest getting only the smaller sizes.\n\nI had a rice and beans burrito, and they let you take one of their hot sauces to the table. I asked for something really hot, and I actually got it. This is surprising for Pittsburgh, because I've noticed overall the town is weak on spice (even the Thai restaurants). \n\nAnyway, the beans in the burrito were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the rice was also plump and lightly spiced. The place is tiny and clean, and I got in and out for under five dollars for lunch.   \n\nThis place is really a gem--its cash only though, so bring that with you.  Good find. A lot better than some of the other places higher up on the list."
"2","Hands down my favorite burrito in the greater Pittsburgh region. The owner always remembers my order when I show up: beans and cheese with rice, size 'chico' (though there's nothing chico about it). It's flavorful, fresh, and filling. I also recommend the taco salad, and the tacos themselves. The only item I've had that was less than thrilling was the vegetarian quesadilla... a little heavy on the cheese. But the rest is so good that an average dish has no bearing on my overall rating. Eating here is a must."
"1","I was walking back and forth through downtown over a series of days and saw Madonna's. I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. \n\nI stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.\n\nThe best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.\n\nI might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational."
"1","Food was only just ok and service was even worse.\n\nThere's plenty of other places you can go to for breakfast  - even Eat'N'Park would be better but hit up a place like Ritter's instead."
"1","Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for The Smithfield Cafe.  \nI had the \""daily special\"" which is pretty much the universal way of condensing \""two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast\"" into two words. Sausage was room temperature, eggs were decent, and the greasy home fries contained the flavor of the dozen meals that were cooked before mine this morning (not i'n a good way). Coffee was plentiful, but not flavorful. \nThe waitresses were grizzled and archetypal for their profession.  \nTo surmise; meh..."
"2","I don't know why this place got such low ratings but I was pleased. I am not used to a place with cheap and good breakfast... I mean $6 got me eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes. It wasn't the best but it was really good.\n\nI thought the service was really good as well. If they had this place in Cali I would probably eat there more often. Much better but the same price as Mc Donald's."
"2","It's been a crazy week in my office, what with it being the end of our fiscal year and all.  So I just had to get me out and have me some good old comfort food for lunch today.  Alone!\n\nSo I had me a good ol' fashioned cheeseburger and fries with some coleslaw.  It really hit the spot so I'm upping my rating to four stars."
"2","I'm taking a megabus today, so I looked on Yelp for a good spot to eat in Downtown Pittsburgh, and so I went here based on the reviews of other yelpers, and my goodness, the burgers here ARE Awesome! Thanks Yelpers!!! The fries came out piping hot, and the server was really friendly. The cook even came out to double check how one of the customers really wanted her burger. When the cook came out, he said \""I just love to cook\"" so there's love that goes into this food.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a good burger. I haven't tried any of the other food, but I'm sure it's good.\n\nDefinitely a good quick spot for good food."
"2","The Adventures of Susan the Zombie on a Monday-After-Holiday morning.\n\nSusan get up.\nSusan get showered.\nSusan get dressed.\nSusan grab purse, briefcase, and coat.\nSusan get out of house.\nSusan get on bus.\nSusan get off bus.\nSusan go to Cool Beans.\nSusan buy black coffee.\nSusan go to office building.\nSusan get on elevator.\nSusan go into her office.\nSusan ingest heavenly coffee from Cool Beans.\nSusan human female again!"
"2","J'adore this store!!!  So beautiful and filled with many inspiration pieces. Very much on the pricey side, but a check online shows me that their stock is not too overpriced. This is def a room in heaven. :)"
"2","Two words: \""Potpourri heaven\"" \n\nI love stopping in to this business every time I find myself in the Strip District. The front entrance, interior and back patio look like something out of a whimsical dried flower wonderland. You'll find everything from single stem flowers to create your own arrangements to paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 dog heads for decoration. The back patio filled with plants and water features is definitely one of the highlights during the warmer months. \n\nPrices can be on the higher side so if you don't find yourself making a grand purchase, inspiration is certainly guaranteed upon exiting the business. \n\nA few other items you'll find at this business: wreaths, terrariums, crafting books, beautiful stationery, and fun garland."
"2","I love  Andy and he loves me. \n\nI used to come here every Sunday after church and order his special not on the menu rolls. Those are awesome.  They are really fresh and flavorful."
"2","Andy's sushi bar is a convenient little stand set up inside Wholly's in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. It's not a dine in type of place, but it is the best sushi I've ever had. \n\nWholly's sells fresh fish and other meats, so a very convenient place for a sushi bar. My personal favorite of Andy's is the Philadelphia roll - without hot sauce! \n\nI used to work in the strip and would often walk down to Wholly's just to get sushi and talk to Andy."
"2","fish is about as fresh as you will find in Pittbsurgh. Andy makes waiting in line a joy. Very generous portion sizes, and unbelievable value (2 large pieces of toro for $5 is unheard of! Not to mention I was given a third 1 at no additional cost)\n\nThe presentation itself leaves something to be desired, not the most skilled with a knife, but the guy has to pump them out fast enough to keep the line moving. - and lets be honest, you're not going to a stand in wholeys for presentation.\nHis special sauce is tasty, some sort of sirracha-esq conccoction, but make sure you make note of it if you don't want this on your fish.\nUses a bit too much rice for my liking on the nigiri pieces, I think he could use about half as much. Though I understand he is located next to a primantis, and this is pittsburgh.\n\nFantastic value, great guy. Will return.\n\noh, and I really mean he's a great guy beyond the generosity with the fish. Today he temporarily stopped service to help a little girl find her mother."
"1","I want to like it.  But ultimately, it took forever to get and he doused my sushi with various sauces that were NOT listed on the menu.  As a condiment-o-phobic, my sushi was ruined and I didn't feel comfortable enough to request it be fixed.  \n\n15$ later, I tossed it and walked out, miserable."
"2","i would give andy 6 stars, if possible due to:\n1. amaaaaaaazing sushi.\n2. hilarious conversation.\n3. fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients.\n4. reasonable prices for the quality of food (which is stellar).\n5. andy's daily specials & inventive use of random sushi components (like mango & mint).\n6. FREE SAMPLES while you wait in line.\n\nandy is the best -- hands-down."
"1","AAahhh.  Why do I have such a discordance with Pittsburgh Yelpers' opinions of sushi places?  This place is not 4 stars.  The long line -- one person, Andy, making the sushi, makes you think it's a gem in the Strip District.  Eh.\n\nWith Andy's Special, there was a variety of rolls, and made with a continuous strip of seawood (ie inside on one roll, outside on the next), which I actually found annoying, as the rolls fell apart when trying to separate them.  There just wasn't any flavor -- so I laid on the soy sauce and wasabi, but to no avail.\n\nI'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments."
"2","Andy the Sushi Guy.  \nFast, entertaining, friendly and did I say fast?  No worries about standing in line and taking a few minutes of your busy day to watch Andy work his magic.  After all, it's not often one can find a fresh fish market with the freshest sushi ingredients. And you can bet Andy the Sushi Guy won't skimp on ingredients.  \nWe stopped by on Saturday about lunchtime when Wholey's is packed with its Saturday shoppers, which is it's usual crowded busy-ness.  Andy's Special for the day:  Tuna & Kiwi  or  Salmon & Avocado FAT Rolls.  Yes, the special of the day is usually a FUTO maki extraordinaire.  \nWe ordered the Tuna & Kiwi and Andy's Sushi Combo.  \nTuna & Kiwi began with crispy dried nori (seaweed) topped with an ample amount of fluffy sushi rice.  Smeared on is Tobiko (flying fish eggs) with its bright orange color. Just as you're admiring his steadfastness, POP goes the rice ladened seaweed as  Andy flips the seaweed to create a reverse sushi roll.  Folks, I'd have to disagree with another Yelper when they say that nori goes on the outside. What's not to like about creativity? And personally, what's not to like about more ingredients that you can stick on the outside of a sushi roll?  Like Tobiko or sesame seeds? hhmm...???? \nContinuing with the innerds of the Tuna & Kiwi roll, more Tobiko, asparagus, seared tuna with a light breading, red leafed lettuce, fresh tuna and kiwi...a la Andy's Special of the day.  Roll up all of these and keeping it in tact so when the slicing begins, all of the innerds remain in tact. Whoosh!  Did you see how he picked up the whole futomaki (fat roll) and placed it in the clear togo container, fan it out, add an ample handful of shyoga (thinly sliced pickled ginger) and a hunk of wasabi (no explanation needed) with soy sauce in a mini condiment cup. Sushi a la Andy the Sushi Guy at Wholey's~~It's what's for dinner!\nIf Andy didn't cut the roll, it would take two hands to pick it up and eat it like a ginormous fat burrito, kinda like you'd get in one of them hole in the wall Tex-Mex joints down close to the border (the US Border, that is).  But it is cut into yummy 8 slices and is done quickly without smushing down the circular form. Instead, admire the sliced sushi serving as you lay it flat and be amazed at the color and textures of the ingredients. Not only does it have fresh fish, but some veggies to add to your daily vitamin intake.  \nThe only 'drawback' and I think that is what some of the sushi connoisseurs are quick to point out, is that the sushi rice is not seasoned.  Yes, folks, traditional sushi rice is seasoned with a slight glaze and a very subtle sweetness.  Now, if Andy seasoned the sushi rice as sushi rice should be seasoned, then I'd have to give the guy at least a 4.5 star rating (fresh ingredients, ample servings, creativity, appearance or presentation and seasoned sushi rice on top of all of that). \nI think I'm going to have to defend Sushi a la Andy against the folks looking for 'traditional sushi' in a sit down sushi bar.  You ain't gonna find it here.  And if that's the limit on your sushi palate, then you're certainly coming to the wrong place!  For if you're looking for fast, fresh and ample, this is it.  The bonus:  Andy treats you with friendly hospitality and part of the Wholey's family."
"1","It really pains me to do this, because Andy himself is such a cool and friendly dude, but after eating at Penn Ave Fish Company for so long...I just can't bring myself to get his sushi anymore. It's... just... not that good.  \n\nIt all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he \""lives\"" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.\n\nI know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!"
"1","I'm sorry, but as cool as Andy is, I just don't like the sushi.  The tuna tasted metallic and mealy, definitely not fresh.  I actually spit it out in my napkin upon first bite.  The portions are large, yes, and the prices are good, but I'd rather pay a little more for sushi that is less suspect."
"2","As much as a sushi fan as I am I going to stick my neck out and say this is the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Here is my reasoning.\n\nAndy is not just a funny guy, but is very generous.  Go when it's not busy and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces.  Talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting with fresh fish.  \nNext the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh.\nFinally, the price, load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.  Try Andy's roll and the Eel sashimi.\n\nGo see Andy for some great sushi and sashimi."
"2","Andy is super entertaining, and serves up the best sushi in the burg!  Don't miss!"
"1","First, do not call me sexy and then give me the two most sinewy pieces of toro possible. That pissed me right off. \nSecond, the rolls here are sloppy. Not only did it fall apart very quickly (and was about 4 times too large to eat: a piece of sushi should be able to be comfortably eaten in one bite), but it seems there isn't much thought given to flavors as far as the special rolls go. After my experience with the toro, I don't think I will be giving any sashimi or  *sushi* sushi rolls a try. While the rolls are large, the prices were quite steep, not what i was expecting for someone based in a market that sells seafood."
"1","Check your candy purchase for FRESHNESS!  I bought 4 boxes of marshmallow cones.  I carried them on a plane to Dallas TX for my adult niece.  When she opened one of the individually wrapped cones, the marshmallow top was as hard as meringue.  I was embarrassed that I gave her old candy that was just purchased days before.  When I returned to pittsburgh I called Fort Pitt.  They said they couldn't do anything unless I returned the candy.  No apology, no concern.  I will not shop there again.  You can find fresh cones and candy at other stores."
"1","As of July 25, 2014, a sign on the front said that it was closed permanently."
"2","Sushi Kim is one of those Korean restaurants you'll find in most N. American cities that don't have a really big Korean population. They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food, which is probably a good move considering the American palate and their general unawareness of Korean cuisine outside of the major Korean enclaves. It's pretty obvious by their name, they aren't trying to hide the fact they are Korean.\n\nI've been there for both Korean BBQ on the second floor and Korean food on the main floor.  I wouldn't trek all the way from CMU to have sushi there since sushi can be more easily had, but definitely for the Korean food. Some would disagree, but I have friends from Seoul who even think Sushi Kim has the best Korean food in Pittsburgh.(Granted we are speaking for Pittsburgh) It is pricier than Korea Garden, but the atmosphere is slightly more \""upscale.\""\n\nThey also have at least 3 brands of soju(Charm, Cheoeum cheo reom, and  Jinro Chamisul), which for Pittsburgh is quite exceptional even though I would only drink the Chamisul. They also have Korean noraebang, which you have to reserve in advance. However they only have Korean songs, so if you can't read Korean you're out of luck. They charge $30/hour. I'm not sure there is any other Korean noraebang in the city. I didn't try it, so I can't say what kind of selection they have for songs.\n\nThe BBQ is a great deal and though not the best I've ever had. It may be the only Korean BBQ grill place in the city. The staff is quite attentive and is pretty good about replacing the grills. I would prefer a different sahm-jang and more variety in the non-BBQ items in the buffet. The BBQ is great for groups and seats 4 people for each grill."
"1","Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.\n\nOh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.  \n\nI was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone."
"1","I wouldn't call this place authentic Korean BBQ. I was disappointed that the \""grill\"" at the table was essentially a frying pan. How can you even come close to delicious Korean BBQ if there is no open flame? Every other BBQ restaurant I've been to has had either charcoal or gas grill.\n\nThe quality of the meats were terrible, though one shouldn't really expect much from a buffet.\n\nI will say, however, that the service was friendly and accommodating. It's spacious, and thus great for large groups of people. Just don't expect fantastic Korean BBQ."
"2","Yelp didn't exist when I used to go here, back in the CMU days, but it is still my favorite Soon Du Bu (Tofu Stew) place - we just LOVED it.  We never ate sushi here, always the korean food.  The hae mul pah jun is yummy, the dol sol bibimbap is good, but the soon du bu jige is the best.  It's run by Koreans, hello!  \n\nWe were lucky to have this place in Pittsburgh - it's not like there was a lot to choose from.  But even now, I rarely encounter a place (in the Bay Area) that has the same quality of tofu stew - and we have a \""k-town\"" here!"
"1","First off, this restaurant is absolutely HUGE. there are a ton of tables, so i'm going to say that this place is good for groups..  When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\n\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\n\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\n\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again."
"1","A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). \n\nI'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience."
"1","Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say, but that's what comes to mind when I think about this place! Sad thing is, I've been here a couple times. Every time I kept thinking it would somehow get better, but no, it doesn't! The Miso soup they serve has this weird after taste, and to be honest, doesn't taste like any Miso soup I've EVER had! So on to the sushi, oh yeah, it's gross too! I think I kept going back because the size of the rolls are humongous. The thing is the fish does NOT taste fresh at all! It's always luke warm and....just.not.good. Oh well, I tried. But I'd suggest you not!"
"1","You can not pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame, it was undercooked and cold. I had to stop eating their sushi in fear I would be sick for work in the morning. Texture and temperature of the fish scared me. Save yourself pain and throw your money out the window. Only plus side was their friendliness in service."
"1","Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!"
"1","I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore. I had a craving for some Korean food and went to the place nearest my office - Sushi Kim in the Strip District that boasts both Korean food and sushi.\n\nLet me say up front - the food I received was delicious. But, I was a bit disappointed with the portion size for my lunch entree. For $12.95, I received just a few portions of ribs (I ordered the kalbi), just 3 ban-chan (side dishes of kimchi, sprouts and broccoli), a small serving of white rice and a miso soup.\n\nDelicious food, small portions and a bit overpriced.  I was thinking of coming back to try to sushi, but I think the price structure needs to be reworked before I return."
"2","one of my favorite restaurants! This is by far the richest bolgolgi I have ever tasted. The staff is the friendliest, Michael is my favorite waiter..super funny! Yes, I am slightly bias because I am Korean but its great food. It's def more on the pricey side I would say compared to most Korean places. I always order the fried pork dumplings and beef bolgolgi. It's obviously cheaper during lunch but I feel that the portions are rather small in the \""box\"" your food comes in. I'm not impressed with their alcohol selection, they need more mixed drinks! I have never tried the sushi so can't comment on that. I do wish it was more of the traditional Korean BBQ. They bring a small cooker to your table and make it but still isn't the same. Nonetheless food is great, this place is def worth checking out."
"1","Sushi Kim has long held a reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in town. However, after repeated visits, I wonder if this stems from the day when Sushi Kim was practically the only sushi restaurant in town. \n\nPlease note that this review pertains to the sushi dining only, for dinner. I've not been there for lunch or had the Korean food.\n\nMy most recent visit typifies each time I've had there. Upon arrival, the place is nearly empty. The service is attentive but indifferent, as if they realize you're a dirty dish that needs to be cleaned - you're taken care of like any other chore.\n\nThe miso soup arrived, and was very tasty. However, it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool. This is pretty normal, as well. \n\nThe most disappointing part is the sushi itself. It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar. Each and every variety is equally disappointing, with the end result being \""Meh\"" to \""Yech.\"" \n\nWith such a large population of sushi places in Pittsburgh these days, and even Giant Eagle in a pinch, there is not really a reason to frequent this place anymore. After a handful of visits based on reputation and the hope that this time might be better, I've made my last trip to Sushi Kim."
"1","I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)\n\nSo, if anyone asks me to recommend a good korean or a sushi place... you can say this will definitely not make the list."
"2","In the past, when I was still living in Pittsburgh, we would go here for the Korean BBQ almost every weekend. I have since found out that it is extremely difficult to get in as it is always reserved by one large group or another (I'm calling you out CMU Korean Student Association). Maybe I'm just unlucky with the timing of my visits. \n\nRegardless, I find it hard to believe the upstairs is exactly filled by these groups. Rather I think they are actually allowing them to reserve the whole floor, which is unfortunate and bad long term business IMO.\n\nThe menu food is OK, a tad expensive, and there are better places.\n\nI'll reluctantly give 4 stars since I haven't actually been able to eat here in over a year (Maybe next time I'm coming to Pittsburgh I will call ahead and put in a reservation, but other Yelpers seem to indicate they will push you out in favor of larger reservations)."
"2","I make it a point to walk down to suski Kim when I'm shopping in the strip district.  I love there sushi.  If you like hot make sure you get the after death roll with an habenero sauce.  It spicy but not going to kill you,  actually has great flavor.  Service is always great anytime I've been there.  Be sure if your craving sushi when in the strip take the walk down.  Only about 5 min past wholeys!"
"1","If you're in the mood for fresh, tasty sushi, this is not the place for you. The food that was delivered to us was simply inedible. Point blank. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a bunch of sushi for dinner with the plan of having tasty leftovers for lunch the next day, so we splurged a little, spent like $60 on various rolls. The presentation was pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us to believe these rolls were pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's the MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, where you can't see the individual grains - but what really horrible was the smell. When we took the lid off the tray, the stench of rotten fish knocked both if us back. I honestly gagged.\n\nIt was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. \n\nWe had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.\n\nWe tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money."
"1","Staff are friendly. Sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better. Otherwise this is a decent sushi place for a lunch once in a while."
"1","I had a lunch there once. The food is ok but it's on the pricy side. I don't think I will be back."
"1","There are much better sushi choices available.  This place is just okay, but I like sushi to be spectacular.  The employees were lots of fun, they had the best sense of humor, and the service was excellent. The prices were very good.\n\nI was there on a Monday, so I just tried the sushi.  I might go back for the Korean BBQ."
"1","Don't bother with the sushi, can't speak to the Korean BBQ.\n\nLong story short: I ordered delivery. Never had sushi delivered before, so maybe this is just the way it goes, but it took almost two hours to get to me. There was condensation inside the sushi container from the rolls sitting on top of the other entree I'd ordered (which was hot) and being held against it in a small bag. Assuming that the rolls were made long before I got them, I just threw out the tuna roll, which was warmer than room temp anyway. Vegetable roll was good, but not exceptional. Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. \n\nMaybe this is better when you dine in. Still, would not recommend. Pricey and doesn't live up to it at all."
"1","Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back."
"1","I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal, but i wanted to give them another shot.  \n\nI ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu.  I believe is was L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip.   My food was terrible.  The miso soup was horrid and old, the sides were awful and everything seemed to be microwaved.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!"
"1","I don't give 2 stars that often but sorry Kim - you were a bitter disappointment. \n\nI was excited to have found a Sushi place in Pittsburgh in walking distance to my apartment. That excitement didn't last for too long when I entered the place on a Monday evening at 7pm, realizing that I was the only one in a rather spacious restaurant.\n\nFine, I had a Sushi craving and couldn't care less. Until the Sushi arrived. I ordered my Spicy Tuna and Salmon rolls, both came within 2 minutes. Strange? Maybe, or just a super fast chef. Sadly, the rolls were falling apart as soon as I looked at them, and the Salmon even tasted... bad. I had to leave it on the plate, which has never happened to me before.\n\nOn the plus side, the miso soup was okay and the service was very attentive, which is not surprising if you're the only one in that place. As there are not too many Korean options in Pittsburgh I encourage you to try the Korean BBQ, especially as the reviews for the Korean food at Kim's on Yelp are not that bad. But for the Sushi - forget it."
"1","I didn't have the awful experience some had here based on prior reviews, but it was definitely mediocre.  I went on a Wednesday evening and the place was totally dead except maybe one couple sitting by the sushi bar part of the time I was there.  Which is sad because they have such a huge space with 2 levels, lots of seating, and great proximity to both the Strip and downtown.  A lot more could be done with this place.  \n\nThe menu was printed in very poor quality with what could have been nice pictures of food options but they were super fuzzy and hard to see.  It seemed like their Korean menu was pretty varied but I had come for the sushi.  I ordered the Kim's Favorite Roll which was described as \""Tuna, Yellowtail, Broiled Eel, and Salmon\""  but what I wasn't expecting was the salmon to be cooked all the way through.  Maybe I  should have read it as \""broiled eel and salmon\"" but that wasn't clear or typical of this sort of roll.  Normally eel is cooked but the other fish are raw unless specified otherwise.  Maybe you'd have a fried roll or something baked or seared on the top, but to cook one type of fish that is normally raw and mix it inside with 2 raw types just seems strange to me.  So it ended up being a really odd combination with the raw tuna and yellowtail next to the cooked sushi which wasn't so great all squished together inside the roll.  The sushi roll was quite large at 16 pieces, but I still felt that 18.95 was really pricey considering the quality of the fish was only mediocre with small portions, and they used a TON of rice. The quality of the fish was again just ok.  Not super fresh but not bad either.  The rolls (and those of my friends) kept falling apart as we tried to eat them.  It seemed they weren't properly wrapped or maybe it was just that they tried to use way too much rice.  One fun thing was that all the rolls came out on little boats, so that was a nice touch.  The roll also came with a miso soup, which was fine but nothing special.  The miso soup didn't have the awful taste some others here reported but it tasted like what I'd make from a powered package rather than made fresh.  I also got the shrimp shumai which were again just ok, and tasted like what I could get from the freezer section of an asian store and microwave myself rather than made fresh.  \n\nOne person at our table got a Korean dish which came with 4 side dishes that were all vegetable except for the fish cakes.  She said her food tasted decent but the beef bul go gi dish she got just didn't look right or have the proper color it should have had.  Just liked kind of dry and plain.  When I went to the restroom I was disturbed to see trays of the Korean side dishes in the hallway just sitting out in the open not covered or anything!  It would be different if the restaurant were bustling but it was totally dead and pretty clear those wouldn't be eaten that evening (so I shudder to think that after hours sitting out uncovered unrefrigerated that they put them out again the next day and hoped someone would eat them...).  If you aren't that busy there is no reason things can't be prepared to order!  That is simply lazy.  Also I overheard part of a conversation between a waiter and a guy at the sushi bar about something being \""expired\"" and what to do about that.  Unfortunately I couldn't hear all the details but it was disturbing since this was after we all had gotten our food already.  I mean it's good they are being mindful of expiration dates but it sounded like someone had to be schooled on it based on what I heard.  But granted that I only heard bits and pieces so I can't say for sure.  I don't think I'll go back here again."
"2","I cringed when I saw that their BBQ buffet price went up to $24/person, considering that I can go to a seafood buffet 10 minutes away for much less. Sushi Kim is a clean and bright place with seats on all two floors. The Korean BBQ buffet is on the second floor and only available on Friday and Saturday evenings starting at 5pm. \n\nThe service was wonderful and the servers really helpful. The Korean BBQ is buffet style, so you help yourself to the raw proteins and vegetables at the buffet bars and then cook them on your hot plate at your table. It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. \n\nThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). \n\nOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh. For being the only Korean BBQ buffet place in the area, it deserves a standing ovation. I had a great time at Sushi Kim and would gladly recommend the Korean BBQ buffet special. Buffet price was a bit high though, so crack open that piggy bank!"
"1","Tried this place based on reviews in local paper and friends. This place was awful. We asked questions of the server and ordered based on them. Neither was good.y friend said she cannot eat real spicy food and asked them to tone it down. Her meal was so hot she couldn't eat it.  Mine was just disappointing. The only thing I found good was the plain rice. I also thought it was extremely over priced. Will not return."
"2","I saw Shakespeare's \""As You Like It\"". Great performance!"
"1","For many years, my best friend and her mother were season ticket holders and when her mother reached a point in age where she could no longer fully appreciate theater (sight and hearing), I became the theater companion. We've been going now for three years, and although the overall 'experience' of the Public is pleasant, the base reason of why I attend 'theater' has been a mixed bag of mostly disappointment.\n\nThe theater itself is a grand and beautiful piece of architecture. Acoustically sound, very comfortable, clean and organized.  The staff, from box office to ushers, is always pleasant and helpful. As with all theaters, the concessions are overpriced, but in this era, that's to be expected. \n\nThe theater offers a LOT of 'fun' incentives to draw in groups and keep folks as regular attendees, like the brunch series for season ticket holders, or the wine Wednesdays, and other 'groupings' that give 'value added' to the experience.\n\nMy friend and I have our tickets on what we call 'donut day', or the brunch series. It kind of an all-you-can-eat continental breakfast with mass donuts, bagels and pastries from Giant Eagle, with coffee and tea.  It's a nice incentive, but we've begun to look forward to the donuts more so than the actual 'theatre' experience.\n\nThe reason I go to the 'theater' is to enjoy the play that's on the stage, and in the past three years, I've been mostly disappointed with the productions. I've seen a LOT of live theater in my life, from small low budget black box, to college, to Broadway tours, with varying levels of production value, but with a much broader range than I've yet to see at the Public.\n\nI've even seen a few productions in other 'less substantial' theaters that the Public presented in the past three years, and had to wonder 'what were they THINKING?' One production, 'ART' comes specifically to mind, having seen it in Florida presented by a mid-level budget theater company with high production value that nailed the script, characterizations and flow 100%. I was excited to see the show again, as it is a spectacular piece of writing - when done right. The moment I walked into the Public's production and sat down and looked at the set, I had to say 'HUH????'  The play that followed kept me saying 'Huh?' They totally missed the boat on direction, character development, as well as a just wrong set.\n\nTheir choices in season also seem to pander heavily to the 'donors' and not to 'theatre' lovers. With all of the scripts available in the world, and I've seen a LOT of them, I have to ask why most of the more challenging pieces (intellectually as well as artistically) are never touched. After three years, we're now asking ourselves if buying season tickets is really worth it, when so many of the shows in the season we've already seen - but we seem to go back out of habit, not out of enjoyment.  This past season, 'Private Lives' was part of the season. I saw Private Lives at the public in the 80's. Pittsburgh Irish and Classical did it three or four years ago. Theatre Factory in Trafford did it two years ago. Again this past year at the Public?  Seriously?  \n\nThe sets for most productions have been great (except for ART), and the performances have been 'ok', with some capable performers who were doing 'just ok'. Exceptions were Superior Donuts, God Of Carnage, and Circle Mirror Transformation. Three plays in three years that were exceptional and worthy of exceptional applause.\n\nYet, da burgh audiences give out standing ovations for EVERYTHING, whether or not it deserves a standing ovation. Do they really believe that all of what they're seeing it exceptional? If so, they need to get out of the box a little more to really experience the difference between 'Yeah, that was ok' and 'WOW!'. \n\nI really miss well-done challenging live theater, and rarely do I find it in Pittsburgh. Instead, I end up settling for an day out with lunch or dinner, good company, and two hours of 'diversion' on the stage that make going to the movies more appealing.  And for me, this is what the Public is...\n\nMaybe it's just Pittsburgh, and a matter of 'giving them what they want'. But every time I receive a 'now playing' e-mail from the many theater sites I belong to, and read the synopsis of the MANY production listings, I drool, and wonder 'Why can't anyone do this stuff HERE??'\n\nThe Public SHOULD be that venue. And their productions SHOULD be on that exceptional level.  Sadly, they just aren't."
"2","We went to the Pittsburgh Public Theater last weekend for a show and I was very impressed with the facilities.  I really like the horse shoe seating the engulfs the stage, and the experience of looking down on the actors.  I also thought the staff was extremely helpful and the actors at the theater were really impressive.  We had no problem getting in and out, ordering a drink quickly at intermission, and receiving directions on where to find our seats.  I like this theater a lot and plan on many return visits.\n\nThe only small drawback is the seats were incredibly uncomfortable for me.  Maybe it was because we were in the balcony and had to turn our bodies at a 45degree angle which would smash your legs again the arm rest, or you could just turn your neck but either way it wasn't real comfy.  I hope in the future we can get a seat more in the middle perhaps alleviating this small issue.  \n\nOverall this is just another great addition to the Pittsburgh's cultural district."
"1","I'm a huge fan of these weekly alternative periodicals. Unfortunately the City Paper has all but vanished from the scene, in it's place a weekly paper hits the stands with nothing but ads, a few music reviews and a restaurant review. Oh, how I miss the days when In Pittsburgh and The City Paper were vying for readership.\n\nWhat happened to that edgy, ruffling of the feathers wit we used to get in stories that meant something? Did the editor lose touch? Did he grow old and lose that liberal ferocity? Or, did every hungry reporter leave town and head to NYC to work at The Village Voice, a REAL alternative newspaper that has more readers than the Times.\n\nIn a large college town like Pittsburgh, a real alternative weekly should be covering college sports, national and local politics, pop culture, the local music scene, computer news, finances...etc.\n\nInstead we get a weekly story, nothing that needs much undercover work, nothing that would cause local politicians to shake in their boots. Nothing that would cause the Post Gazette to stand up and take notice. Basically running feel good stories that will keep the City Paper out of the courts.\n\nAs much as I hate Mark Madden, at least when he wrote a story in the City Paper it was edgy, eye opening, and he was usually correct.\n\nThe City Paper is in need of new blood, after all it's 2010 and the editor needs replaced in favor of hungrier reporters who have a story worth telling."
"1","The location is nice, with plenty of outdoor seating on the river. The food is not that great.  They have an all you can eat crab leg dinner.  My husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked.  I had a crab cake sandwich in which I could not really taste the crab.  \n\nPrices:  Sandwiches ~$10, Entrees, ~$18, Crab legs, $25."
"1","Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic, but that's the only good point of the place.  Food's okay - nothing to write home about; service is pretty average and a bit unfriendly; decor is a little too \""tacky nautical\"".  Prices are pretty average, but too high for the quality and service levels."
"2","Totally underrated by the Yelpers!\n\nI freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also, I feel guilty at not letting people in on this gem.\n\nTo be clear, I LOVE Redfin Blues for a very SPECIFIC purpose: sitting outside on the patio by the water on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of Red Stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with B, Ems, Boyfriend, and whoever else is so lucky.  It is a hidden gorgeous Pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near Washington's Landing (note: the Yelp map is wrong) where you don't feel at all like you're in Pittsburgh, but instead on vacation.\n\nDisclaimer: I have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys (from no actual fraternity), Cougars, tramps, creatures of the night  -- or undesirables.  I don't go at night so my credibility wanes here a little.\n\nI basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp.  It's just cooked shrimp - sometimes it's big, sometimes it's little.  But it's $17 for TWO pounds which isn't too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends.  Ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty - yum! I've also had the fried cod sandwich - the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good!  I always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know I have an obsession with fried crispy-ness.  The breading isn't too too heavy so that is a plus too.  I've also had the crab cakes which are meh  but fine for Pittsburgh standards and I would definitely steer clear of the crab legs.  \n\nOk, so really you should go to this place - if you like peel and eat shrimp, cold drinks by the river, and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly.  Some of my favorite Pittsburgh moments happened here and that's saying a LOT.  Redfin Blues makes me miss you Pittsburgh!"
"1","Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining, so this place wins points for ambience on a nice warm day. Have a drink and enjoy the deck, but save your dining budget for somewhere else.  The menu is blah and the food is also.\n\nI recently had lunch here, and the waitress first forgot my meal entirely, bringing food to everyone else at the table.  When I reminded her, she returned with my clam chowder, spilled it, didn't apologize, and didn't clean it up.  All that would have been forgiven if the soup had been any good."
"1","After reading old reviews I figured that some change had to have occurred over the last year and gave it a shot. Went with my boyfriend after biking along the north shore trail, and didn't tell him about the negative reviews since I REALLY wanted to sit along the river. The view/environment is still very pretty, but we both found ourselves displeased with the food and the service. We both got the beer battered cod sandwhich (convinced him to go basic after reading bad things about the food) and although he enjoyed it, I thought the batter was very doughy and uncooked on the fish, and the tartar sauce tasted grainy (any giant eagle brand would have been better). It didn't seem like others were too crazy about the food as I heard the woman behind us complaining that her dish wasn't cooked and would like a refund. The beers were bottled and cold, so couldn't complain there, but the service was still poor as we were rushed to choose our drinks/dishes and given a second to pay. Would have thought after all the reviews that they would have changed employees. Overall, I would come here again only for some beers and nice seating, but would eat dinner beforehand."
"1","Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste your money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost.  Ordered food for 3 adults, one kid, food came for adults, after a couple of minutes my mom asked when my sons food would be coming, waitress said she would check, came back and said his pizza hadnt been cooked yet. Cancelled the pizza, paid $4 for a little bowl of white lettuce with some cheese thrown on it, fried shrimp was expense, but looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke to manager, who had a horrible attitude and found out that the waitress never put the pizza order in for my son and then lied and told the manager he wasnt at the table when we ordered our food. If you give these people your money, it would be foolish!"
"1","Ate this yesterday and was very impressed with the atmosphere and scenery, but that was about it. The wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor. I figured seafood would be their bread and butter but their Ahi tuna was tasteless. The salads you get with an entree is the size of a dixie cup and the lettuce is cheap iceburgh crap. If I go back again I will def just order beer and appetizers as the Buffalo shrimp were pretty good. If showing someone the city this is a good place for atmosphere but if you're a food critic check your taste buds at the door."
"1","I love the location, and I keep trying to give Redfin Blues a chance, but the food is always average at best and the service is less than mediocre.  The setting is fabulous, there's a bike trail that runs right through the middle of the restaurant and you can sit right along the river and feel like you are in some exotic location.  I still enjoy eating here on occasion, but I always keep my expectations low about the food and service.  Maybe one day that will change."
"1","The only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid, it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.\n\nOne year I took my father here for his birthday.  I don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the ONLY reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  She forgot my dad's food order.  She brought out mine, but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  The manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab, btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  Then when they brought my dad's steak out, the waitress dropped it (I felt bad for her), and apparently that was their last steak.  I just paid the bill and we left and went to Eat n Park.\n\nThe second time I came back the service was equally as terrible, but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  Seriously, attacked by wasps.  My friend got stung.\n\nAnother time I'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  When we showed up, it was like I'd never called.\n\nThe last time I was there it was ok, but after being attacked by wasps my friend and I opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.\n\nThe service here SUCKS.  Getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  It just sucks here.\n\nBut the atmosphere is fantastic!  When your waitress comes ot hte table, just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok."
"2","Finally, the beer battered fish sandwich I had been looking for (I'm starting quite a few of my reviews off like this lately. Hmm ... )!\n\nSomehow, even though I had been living in Heinz Lofts for a year, I had never heard of this place. It's literally a two minute drive from there or a great bike ride, but whatever. That mistake has been rectified. \n\nI went for lunch last week with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers. Anyone who knows me knows that I love the outside. Sitting outside and eating and drinking, not really being active outside. So this place is right up my alley.\n\nWhen we were first handed the lunch menu, I thought, \""Eh.\"" It's short and seemed really random. I settled on the fish sandwich as it was cheap and I still wasn't 100% sold on this place. They do have Heineken Light, which I am a big fan of, so that was a plus. For me, at least. I think I am alone in this city with my love of Heini Light. \n\nMy fish sandwich was so, so tasty and what I had been looking for since I went to Penn Ave Fish Company. Perfect breading and the bun did not conflict with the taste. I slather on the tartar sauce because I'm that kind of gal. I had fries as a side and they were tasty.\n\nGreat lunch and great location for relaxing. I could have stayed there all day."
"1","It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river, hovering above Washington's Landing Marina. However, the service is seriously lacking. With my parent's boat docked right below Redfin's, we frequently dine here before headed out on the water. The service has always been very slow. I understand that on a typical Friday or Saturday night it can get rather busy, but they should anticipate the crowd and be able to plan accordingly to accommodate! Luckily, the view is so nice that most of the time we're left waiting....and waiting....and waiting....it isn't too big of a deal because we're enjoying the outdoor space. \n\nThe food is average. Nothing I've had there was to die for, but on the same token, nothing was awful either. I'd only suggest this place to marina-goers or those looking for a nice outdoor dining space. Oh, and only come if you have lots of time!"
"1","average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going. \n\nThe beer battered fish is good, yet there's much better in the city. It's nice and crispy, served on a fresh roll, tartar, lettuce, all that jazz. However again it's not worth venturing over for unless weather is perfect for an evening outside. \n\nChicken quesidilla, same thing. Average. \n\nI've went for 6 years now waiting for it to become something good. It's not going to happen. But I'll keep trying hoping."
"1","Dear Redfin Blues,\n\nI can't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment. Such high expectations were set when we were greeted at the host stand and sent of for cocktails on a 20 min wait list (which apparently never existed). After 30 mins and seeing literally 4 parties that noticeably came in after us be seated, I reminded the host who directed us to the bar that we were still waiting. After 20 more minutes and 2 more parties getting sat (one who sat themselves) I approached a blonde woman seating and cleaning tables to let her know that we could be removed from the \""list\"". To which she replied \""what list?\"" And didn't even bother to apologize... nothing was offered to assist us in our search for sustenance nor was there anything offered for our inconvenience. Fortunately, for us, the disaster at your restaurant lead us to discover a new place, that we have decided to frequent. So, thank you for f**king up."
"1","Just returned from RFBlues, where I usually enjoy myself quite a lot.\n\nThe bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer. No big\ndeal; pink salmon looks a lot like white chicken, assuming she's\ncolorblind. I waited.\n\nAnd had a 2nd drink.\n\nAnother group of 3 people came in after that, ordered their meals, and\ngot served their entrees.\n\nI went up to the bartender and asked when my dinner would be coming.\nShe announced that \""salmon takes longer to cook\"" (than what??? a raw\nsalad? I cook; salmon is one of the fastest things on earth to cook!),\nand that \""I was about to check on that...\"" It had been over an hour by\nnow.\n\nI got my sandwich promptly after complaining.\n\nA few minutes later, when I finished my salmon, I got my side of\nvegetables (apparently vegetables take even longer than salmon to\ncook!).\n\nAll sarcasm aside: one screw up is tolerable. The second - forgetting\nto even check on my late order until I complained, an hour after I\nordered, is not. And yet, I wasn't given the least consideration in\nthe bill."
"1","A little pricy for food but not too bad. Sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day. When they put the boats in the water it's a little noisy but entertaining. I had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland. Iced tea was good. This is not the place to come to have a good meal, but a nice view and a breeze then it's ok. Next time I think I will just get drinks and an appetizer and enjoy the view.\nOther people I see complained about the service but our waitress was really good and took care of us without hovering."
"2","Completely chill environment. I pretty much always get the chicken quesadilla which is awesome, so I really can't comment on anything else. The prices are good and the service is quick."
"1","It was my Anniversary tonight, a Tuesday. I was so excited to get All You Can Eat Crab  Legs!!! My favorite food of all time!!! But when we arrived at 8:20pm, the very unfriendly waitress said that their kitchen was closed!!!!! BOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Their website, as well as Yelp, states that they are open until 10pm!!! We would've been long gone by then! Very disappointing. Well, we ended up driving a lot farther than we intended, but had a wonderful dinner at Joe's Crab Shack in Station Square. I got my LEGS!!!! And they had $2 Hurricanes to boot!!! Ended up eating a better meal, with cheaper drinks, and we ended up tipping our waiter 30% because he was awesome!!!! Should've just gone there in the first place! I will know better from now on!!!"
"1","The food can be ok.. So can the service.. If you come by boat or bike make sure you are fully clothed.. They may look at you like you are nuts if you show up in a bathing suit.. For every 2 good waitresses there is 1 good.. I like the beer battered chicken sandwich.. The shrimp quesadilla had weird textured shrimp.. The peel and eat shrimp are pretty good.."
"2","I am so mad at myself I didn't schedule with Dr. Shaffer sooner.  I initially made an appointment at another downtown office, but felt I needed a second opinion.   I was directed to Dr. Shaffer's office in the Park building (the corner of Fifth Ave. and Smithfield) on the 13th floor (the wayfinding is in case you would have been forced to ask the guards desk at the entrance of the building otherwise like me I had no idea where I was going, although I'm very familiar with the downtown area... I'd hate for you to be turned away from such an awesome practice because of their rudeness and unhelpful attitude) by a referral of a friend/co-worker. \n\nI was in pretty bad shape for about a month, suffering really. Dr. Shaffer was simply amazing!  In the span of a week I went from being a 7-8 on pain scale of 1-10 having my husband helping me shower and dress to maybe a 5-6 which is a BIG relief of pain and being able to bend over and get my shoes on all by myself! He taught me proper movements, to alleviate some pain by less twisting and turning and how to elevate my lower half properly to take pressure off my spine.\n\nI could tell he was truly sympathetic to my case, and was detailed in explaining my diagnosis,  in a way I understood just fine...Im one who appreciates visual learning the most, he had models in order to explain his findings to me. I feel it's important that a Dr. explains his assessment and plan as one progresses through the appointment, and boy did he ever. I never once had a question about what a machine was or what he was doing next. A+! I was not uncomfortable at all, I felt well taken care of.  He has a great personality,  a great sense of humor, and very concerned about the wellbeing of his patients.  Truly an answer to my prayer to stop this pain! \n\nI noticed each morning I was there (although I was late SHAME ON ME!) I was in and out in a decent amount of time, and he was even answering his own phones and checking his own patients in and out. Absolutely seamlessly,  very efficient! I'm so impressed by everything in this office. \n\nI will NEVER go anywhere else.  Also-I forgot to mention that I am uninsured,  but his pricing was so affordable, seriously the only single time I was heaitant with this Dr. was after I asked how much it was going to cost and before he answered. Mostly because I had peviously shelled out my liver for the previous Dr. I'd seen who didnt help me at all. So if you are not insured, still do not hesitate to schedule with this Dr. it is affordable QUALITY,  COMPREHENSIVE care, your body will thank you. \n\n You'll also appreciate the folder he gives you at the close of your visit, you get in writing all of the steps he's taken and what you should expect in the days after you see him and before your next appointment. He stated that he also likes to pick a different educational article to give to all his patients every week, which I read and appreciated as well!\n\nA great review aside the best compliment I can give this Dr. is the referral of my friends, familes and co-workers.  You'll be happy you chose to rely on an online review and a referral to book an appointment with this Dr.! \n\nI guess the one negative thing I'd comment on is that he has short hours BUT that's no excuse, and not truly a negative.  If you need HIM to make your health care a priority than YOU need to make yours a priority as well, and take the appointment he or Erica gives you and make it work...afterall you are in a lot of pain, aren't you?"

"1","This store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving. I was with 3 white people and 1 black person. When we left, the worker pulled the black person aside and demanded to check his pockets. She did and found nothing. In the middle of the Strip District, this store can still be racist?"
"2","Joh and Jaimee are magic; I don't trust anyone else; nuf said"
"1","I hate to write mean reviews, but I really did receive the worst haircut of my life (no hyperbole) from this place, one that really can't be fixed now until I wait for it to grow out.  I walked in with long hair and normal-looking bangs that all needed significant trimming.  The stylist said he would need to take a couple of inches off of the length due to damage.  I said that was fine.  I did not ask for any other style changes.  I somehow walked out with bangs that take up most of the front part of my head, much like a small child's haircut (to serve the purpose of keeping hair out of the child's face).  He also took almost five inches off the length, instead of the \""couple\"" promised.  I feel like my haircut looks like a cross between a bowl cut, a female mullet, and the futuristic look of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction.  I'm pretty open minded to different haircuts, but this one is truly awful, and it's too short now for me to even pull it back easily to try to make it look better.  \n\nI'm going to a place in Shadyside today to see if they can maybe do extensions to remedy the mullet look, or implement some kind of other cut to make it look a little better.  It's a shame, because this place is downtown and so convenient to my workplace, but I certainly will not risk it again.\n\n:("
"1","Rotten food and over charging customer.\n\nI was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant, but was greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged me 20% premium over prices on online menu (I ordered takeout), denied there are prices online. The maitre D was reluctant to show the printed menu, which is 10% more expensive than online, led me to think the over charge was deliberate. \nThe crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't have time to walk 10min one way to return the food, it had to be thrown away.   A lunch over charged and wasted."
"1","Had dinner here on a weeknight before taking my daughter to the nutcracker.  It was dead, but we were early on a Tuesday night, and it picked up.  \n\nWe started with the fried zucchini.  The consensus was thumbs up.  Bread was average.\n\nI ordered the veggie pasta.  Asked for it w/out zucchini but was told it wasn't possible as it was pre-made.  It was ok.\n\nMy daughter had the cheese raviolis and enjoyed them.\n\nThe other three people had the seafood platter special.  Didn't go so well.  The shrimp and scallops were good, the sole was ok, but  all three sent theirs back because the lobster wreaked of ammonia.  Our waiter appeared overwhelmed by having to serve a bad product, and was only semiapologetic.  They then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine.\n\nService was average at best.  Feel bad given how long it has been around, but it is hard to imagine making a return trip."
"1","As a lifelong Pittsburgher, I've been to Tambellini's enough times over the years -- and I think it's still open simply because of it's location practically next door to the Benedum, and patrons who go there aren't the regular theater-goers.  I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.\nThe prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.\nThe waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.\nEven though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's."
"1","AVOID EXCEPT FOR SHEER LAUGHS\n\nThis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what NOT to do in a \""fancy\"" Italian restaurant.  Meals are $30 a plate, but ask your waiter for a bottle of Prosecco and he says, \""What is that?\""  We ordered a gin and tonic, watched him make it, and were served our mixed drink literally with no ice.  Who serves a drink without ice?  We had no silverware, had to request it repeatedly.  Our entrees, dessert and coffee all came out at different times.  We received the check before being asked if we even wanted dessert or coffee, for that matter.\n\nSo - service aside, the food is just mediocre and of no relevance to the Italian inspiration it proclaims.  Our stuffed banana pepper appetizer was too hard to cut with a fork but we had no knives.  The prime rib was fatty and cold.  The crab cakes were far more cake than crab, you had to eat around it leaving a pile of filler mush.  Pasta was just pasta.  \n\nThe atmosphere is also drab and just depressing.  \n\nAnd the split plate fee is exorbitant, so we lied and shared food anyway.  Note that our check was still nearly $300 - for only five of us!\n\nReally, truly, avoid this place at all costs unless you're looking for a good story to laugh about.  The only redeeming quality here after an overpriced meal was that it left our party of 5 with a good story to tell.\n\nThis is the second time I've been here, the first time we just had sandwiches in the basement and it was also far from memorable.\n\nAVOID!"
"1","They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine."
"1","A friend recommended this to me, and I can't figure out why.  The food was underwhelming and pricey.  The service was fine, and the place looked nice, but I can barely remember what I ate there it was so forgettable."
"1","It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \""we read on Yelp this place sucks, but we wanted to give it a try\"" to which she replied they don't alow that but I will let it slide. The food could have come from a buffet and been better. I hate to be super negative, but in this case I am just being real."
"1","This place is just a flat out joke.  Totally overpriced.  Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% \""service\"" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business."
"1","My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1."
"1","The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay."
"1","Since closed.  Surprise surprise."
"2","I went there after an interview with Highmark. I was satisfied. Nice atmosphere, may be a little pricey for a day to day lunch, but would be a nice treat to yourself every once and a while, My salad was what I expected, Fresh leafy greens and very good house dressing. My meal was enjoyable I got spicy beef dish and it came with potatoes. Dessert was very good. Overall, not a bad place, I would go back."
"1","Fairly average Italian food other than the meatballs. Too many good Italian places in Pittsburgh to choose here. Interior could use an update. Beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks."
"1","The food quality doesn't match the place at all. I think it's ok for a pub but this place is supposed to be a nice place for professional lunches. \nI had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken! \nWith so many options around that area I won't pick this place for lunch."
"2","Located downtown, call Dr. Greg and he can get you in that day, sometimes within the hour.  He's a cool guy, very friendly, and not a new-age, hippy, sales-y doctor like some of the other chiropractors that I've been to.  Accepts insurance & FSA...if you work downtown, I recommend him."
"2","Clean fast and the dr is great.   Highly recommend."
"2","Dr Greg is great! Staff is very friendly as well. HIGHLY recommend them to you if you work in the downtown pgh area"
"1","ZERO Stars.  Today, my friend in a wheelchair came in and his friends wanted to sit at the bar for a slice.  They asked if there was an exception to the rule about being at the bar.  The manager told my friend that he could not be accommodated.  That's illegal and immoral and absolutely disgusting."
"1","Villa used to be really good and reasonably priced.  Ever since their facade renovation, addition of a ice cream machine, and maybe even date a little farther back ... the overall offerings are overpriced by about $2.00 per item on average.\n\nThe pizza is good, but if you order during rush hour you're in hit-or-miss territory for quality and temperature.  Hoagies are usually good regardless of how busy they are, it's just a matter of how long it'll take between ordering the hoagie and finally getting to eat said hoagie.  I haven't tried their salads or other dishes ... but for the most part I have heard nothing but positive reviews about their food.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of thin flimsy crusted pizzas ... so while nice sometimes, I continue looking for a nice thick slice of pizza that I can adopt as my \""go-to\"" quick lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh."
"2","Update time:  How easy is it to win me back?  Remind me how good your hoagies are, that they're not overpriced like the Pizza is, and then serve me endless glasses of Coke Zero.  That's how!  Villa has regained a fan in me...good hoagies and Coke Zero...SWEET!"
"2","The canned mushrooms are gone!  Hurray!  Went back today for lunch for a pepperoni and mushroom Calzone.  It was huge!  The price was $12.25 which is a little high for lunch but it was very enjoyable.  The dough is very thick.  This is the best Calzone I have ever had.  It is filled with lots of cheese and toppings."
"1","The only good thing this restaurant has going for it, is their bar! \n\nThey have 22oz glasses!!!  and is very close to my job, which is great for an after work drink \n\nThe food is terrible I mean the worse of the worse, I am not a big fan of Italian food and it's because of restaurants like this!! \n\nOn one occasion I made the mistake of ordering food from this restaurant I had tortellini  in a tomato sauce,  I've had better Italian food from a can.\n\nMore is not always better the serving size could easily have fed six grown adults."
"1","Meh - it's not that there was anything bad about the pizza, it just didn't blow me away or anything.  Good for a quick lunch at the counter."
"1","Done with this place...  It seems every time we go there they get slower and slower.  Today we waited 50 minutes for a cheese pizza that we never got before walking out.  I complain to the guy making pizzas and he says \""you're not the only one's here\"".... Well, he secured the fact that I will never be back again."
"2","This is a great little stop on Smithfield Street.  Frankie the bartender is a major plus and the food across the board is a plus. They offer a wide range of pasta dishes, hoagies, and pizza. I have to recommend the pizza. Though i have tried about a dozen dishes and no complaint. I usually get a slice of pizza and today I added in a side of meatballs. I do want to add you won't be paying a fortune at this place.  The service can get bogged down at lunch but the staff will get you in and out. Try it out and go hungry! I bet you won't spend $10. Bring a few friends and split a pie. ;)"
"2","So I started a new job downtown (I moved from NYC during the summer), and some coworkers took me here just last week for lunch.  Since the move from NY, I'd been really craving some quality, New York-style pizza, and hadn't had a ton of luck finding any (although the search introduced me to some excellent \""Pittsburgh-style\"" pizza joints, so I'm not complaining.)  \n\nVilla Reale really came through.\n\nI loved that you could order a slice with basically whatever toppings you wanted (I'm used to being at the mercy of whatever \""slice\"" pie has been languishing under a heat lamp for 3 hours).  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage slice, and the small feast that was presented to me did not disappoint.  The slice was huge, the pepperoni crispy, the sauce really balanced (not too sweet, not too garlicy), the cheese fresh and delicious and the crust...oh man...thin and crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside.  One slice was perfect to fill me up for lunch, too.  \n\nFull disclosure: while the wait staff is so friendly, they do get overwhelmingly busy at lunch.  We went to the place at 11:00 so we could sit at a table (if you want to dine-in and order a slice during lunch, you can only sit at the counter, not a table, after 11:30) and by 11:30 the place was standing room only.  My coworkers informed me that somehow, their pizzas are even better when ordered by the pie (hard for me to fathom) and also that their hoagies are delicious, so I'm sure I'll be trying one of those next time.  \n\nIt's not the most inexpensive pizza joint downtown (I think my slice ended up being $4-$4.50) but if you're a recovering Noo Yawker like me looking to fulfill some culinary nostalgia, this is your place."
"2","I went here on the day of a wedding (I'm from out of town) for a last minute pedicure. I didn't really know where else to go, so I just stopped here on a whim (it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails). \n\nThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC (and wonderful to chat with). It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \n\nThought it was worth a review."
"2","Definitely recommend this salon! I booked an appointment after having many failed attempts with other stylist that are not able to work with biracial hair. I was frustrated and tired of having the same look because of my unruly mop. I have thick, frizzy, and  curly hair that cannot be tamed easily. The stylist that ended up doing my hair was Chris and she was fantastic! She listened to what I wanted, was fun to talk to, and gave me many helpful tips. I walked out of the salon feeling very satisfied with my new look. Anyone that has biracial hair or children with it should make an appointment with her, you will not be let down!"
"1","The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess.  http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/"
"1","Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money, this place doesn't deserve to be named Ruth Chris. I've had better steaks at the Outback Steakhouse!!"
"1","I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places, but I wasn't that impressed.  The service was impeccable, but the food - not much different than Outback or Texas Roadhouse."
"2","I've been to this Ruth's Chris several times. Often in the winter, we will head in for an early dinner and then skate off the calories at the PPG ice rink across the street.\n\nAs long as you make a reservation, seating shouldn't be a problem. I have never had to wait more than five minutes unless I was waiting for someone. If you do have to wait, sit at the bar and order one of their cocktails (Pear Martini and the mojito are excellent.) Extensive wine list.\n\nAll of the appetizers are delicious. Favorites include the Ahi Tuna, crabcake, and stuffed mushrooms. But you're going there for the steak, right? Right. \n\nThe last time I went, they had a special where two people could have filets and split a lobster. We elected for this option. I ordered my steak medium. It came out sizzling in butter. After overcoming my caveman urges to tuck in to the obviously too-hot-to-eat-yet steak, I instead ate some of the asparagus we ordered as an appetizer. \n\nImportant note. At Ruth's Chris, almost all sides are family sized so you can share. Our asparagus was perfectly cooked and was accompanied by a delicious hollandaise. \n\nFinally, we made our way to the steaks. Cooked exactly to order and seared in butter, it was delicious and tender. The lobster was slightly overcooked, but still tasty. \n\nService is always excellent. Tip well. \n\nCons. The restaurant is very expensive. I like to go for special occasions or for when they have specials."
"2","I took my girlfriend here for our 6 month anniversary dinner for a nice night out. I had been here several times before but she had not. As per past experience it was a very nice experience with a good wait staff, and wonderful food. As usual I managed to devour every bit of my t-bone. When asked ifnwe were going to have dessert we declined as we decided to go to our favorite dessert place. We were pleasantly surprised when our waitress retrned with a plate which had strawberries and whipped cream, and happy anniversary written in chocolate! Needless to say that was quite wonderfully sweet in a few ways! All in all we will be dining here again."
"1","As early 90's rapper Tone-Loc once said \""Let's do it.\""\n\nUnless you have spent your first 20 years or so in a subterranean nuclear fall out bunker, odds are you know of Ruth's Chris. The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris."
"2","Best Steaks in Pittsburgh!!! I come here a lot for special occasions.  It is a pricy place but it is worth every penny. I had a New York Strip and it was really tender and juicy.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.  The service is excellent also."
"1","ok I am trying to catch up on my reviews and since coming back from vaca in great SF and I have jetlag with nothing else to at the moment, I am trying to do just that. My husband and I have eaten at RCSH over the years and with each visit the service has gotten increasingly worse! The food is wonderful as always but really with our dinners averaging 200 plus tip I believe the service should be topnotch. What happened RC???? WE LOVE your food but can't justify the prices with service so bad. We should not have to keep looking around for our waiter for a drink refill and we told numerous times we would like bread with our meal and when we brought it up to him, his reply was, \""oh the bread is done yet\"" and no reply about the drinks...sad...too busy talking with the other staff(this did happen last October, before the Yo-yo Ma concert we attended) Hey, maybe they have improved..but ah we are not taking anymore chances with this place!"
"1","I took my parents out to celebrate the Christmas season.  My mother ordered the petite filet mignon, which she thought was very good.  The sides we ordered - mashed potatoes and creamed spinach, were also good.  However, my father and I shared the porterhouse for two.  For $90, I would have expected a much better piece of meat.  Flavor was good, but It was tough.  There were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife.  In addition, the presentation was poor.  They put a big plate in the center of the table, then cut up the steak into 10 or 12 cubes.  These cubes were then cooked.  I could have done better at home."
"1","I'm really torn by this review. For years and years this was my favorite restarant in the downtown area. We went there last Saturday for dinner and had what I would deem an average meal at exorbitant prices. The salads, while tasty, were much smaller than I had remembered previously.  The side dishes, again, were seemingly smaller to not only me but our party as well. Unfortunately, the worst part of my meal were the steaks. For $45 I received a New York Strip that was WAY overpriced (my wife makes it all the time and much much better) and was, in a word, chewy. The service overall, was quite good, unless you like a car valet (they don't have it). Next time I'll try Morton's or Capital Grille."
"1","Good steak if you don't get out much.  Not nearly as good as the price would lead you to believe.  Ruth's Chris will never be a Morton's or a Gibson's.  While Pittsburgh does not have a Gibson's, you should really go to Morton's.  \n\nThe atmosphere is alright, the drinks moderately stiff, and the salad was great...  But one is supposed to come here for steak. \n\nRegrettably, my last two trips (I wasn't paying... hence why I went back) gave me a piece of beef like my late grandma would cook in her oven's broiler with butter.  For a $50 strip, I would expect it to be more like the hand cut, unfrozed meat I make for my grilling parties.  As such, I would rather fire my grill up in December than give Ruth's Chris more money for mediocrity.\n\nGood Talk."
"2","Alot of people wrote spot on positive reviews so i will some it up, they are probably the best steak house in Pittsburgh and that is saying something.  Pittsburgh has many good steakhouses.  Go earlier in the week, if your like me you hate waiting but Ruth's is probably the exception if you dont have a resavation. \n\nScore\nFood Quality 5\nService 4\nAtmosphere 4 \nValue 4\nRecommend 5\n\nTier 1"

"2","Employees were all working hard very nice and conversational.  My family and I enjoyed celebrating my birthday here over the weekend"
"1","So many people have raved about this place so I was so excited to bring my husband for his birthday. We were greeted by friendly staff and walked through the room that smelled of wonderful steak. We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything was fine until we got the food which was disappointing. I ordered off the special menu and had the corn chowder, a filet and lobster tail, a side of creamed spinach and dessert for about $55. My husband had the cowboy ribeye for $65, the scallops to start and a side of brussel sprouts. \n\nThe corn chowder was ok but not very hot. The scallops which came recommended were ok but they were on a pesto sauce which was simply too overpowering for the delicate scallop. We used the pesto to dip the bread in. The steaks came and were both overcooked. They were supposed to be medium rare but my filet was well done and his was more like medium. We should have complained but we decided to just eat bc we didn't want to wait and didn't think that they would be less well done since they come on a scorching hot plate. My husband liked the brussel sprouts but my creamed spinach was not hot and was stringy. \n\nAgain, the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly. I booked on opentable and told them that it was his birthday and they did bring him a complimentary dessert. I prefer Morton's, Ditkas and Peter Luger's."
"1","I have eaten at a lot of Ruth's Chris joints.  This was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them.  Apparently not part of the main chain and it shows.   Fail on all levels.  Had to send steak back twice before I just said to hell with it.  Horrible."
"2","Ruth Chris Steakhouse is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh. Ironically, my family and I avoid eating red meats whenever possible, which seems awkward when dining at a renowned steakhouse. That being said, no red meat platters were placed in front of us.\n\nThe service here is impeccable. The waiters are amazingly helpful, poised, and polite. \n\nThe food we ordered arrived fairly quickly. I got the lobster mac 'n' cheese, my dad ordered chicken, my sister got medium rare fish, my mom ordered a salad, and as sides we all ordered cream spinach and mashed potatoes with garlic. All the foods were flavorful and seasoned and prepared perfectly. \n\nAs we moved onto dessert, the choices were hard because everything sounded extremely delectable. I got the Chocolate Sin Cake, which the espresso and chocolate mixed together was mouth-watering. My sister ordered the Strawberries and Cream. The strawberries tasted fresh and sweet. My parents split an amazingly tempting apple cobbler served warm with vanilla ice cream and overflowing with delicious apples"
"2","I read an article recently in the Post-Gazette that says to wring the most wear out of what they own, people are visiting auto mechanics, cobblers, tailors and computer repair experts as they haven't in years.  I believe it.  Business at Ullrich's has been good recently, especially since they moved into their present location.  Ullrich's has been around in one form or another for over 80 years and a couple of years ago they moved to their present location.\n\nUllrich's offers a full line of services including shoe and purse repair, desalt and waterproofing, and jacket and zipper repair.  Can't make it into their store?  You can even send your shoes to be repaired via mail!  No, really!  Check it out!    http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/mailorder.htm\n\nAnyway, my husband Rick asked me to drop off his shoes to get them resoled here.  I just picked them up on lunch a few minutes ago and they look practically new.  He had me drop off his leather jacket to have a tear repaired last year and they did a fantastic job.  I've had one of my purses repaired here too.  We've always been satisfied with their work.  \n\nIt's so good to see people renovate and repair rather than throw out.  Rick and I have been doing that for years."
"2","Needed the heel on my work shoe repaired. I walked in and they fixed it right there and then. Quick and sufficient! Definitely recommend this place to the locals."
"1","Short story: the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots, said he didn't do it, tried to clean it up and took out some of the leather's dye instead, and didn't give me a refund (I'd already paid).  Moral the story: if you risk this dude, only pay him at the end after you check for damages.  Long story below.\n\nOh, Groupon, you've steered me wrong yet again.  I have awful luck with service at places were I've used Groupons overall...hey, you put out a Groupon to bring in customers, not to be pissed when said customers show up for their discounts! basically, I think the cobbler screwed me because he was only making $5 for $40 worth of services.\n\nI dropped off two pairs of leather riding boots to get new heels.  I had called and been given a quote of $20 a pair and was told that they still do same day service.  I'd had a bad feeling about the place after I called for the quote and the guy I talked to the didn't know what riding boots looked like...He thought they had a spiked heel...but I had that magical Groupon to use, so I went anyway.\n\nSo, I went.  After some haggling (and after seeing I had a Groupon), the cobbler told me that my soles were \""bald tires\"" and he had to replace those as well.  So now we're up to $40 a pair.  I said fine because I love these boots and they were quite expensive.  I was told to come back after 2pm.\n\nThree hours later, I return.  The cobbler finishes one boot immediately and hands it to me to look at.  I'm pleased and say so.  I pay.  I'd brought my own canvas tote so I start packing up the boots as they are done one by one.  And then I see it appearing on the remaining three boots...the brownish-black rubber from the soles is fingerprinted all over boot's shaft.  Oh, hell no.  Here's the play-by-play:\n\nMe: Uhhhh, I don't think this was on the boots before.  [points to blobs]\nFront Counter Lady: I don't know, but you don't understand the process.  It's not possible for that to happen.\nCobbler: [Not even looking]  Nope, I didn't do that.  That must have been there.  Looks like hair stuff.\nMe: [WHAT] Um, I'm pretty positive it wasn't there.  [Get out my phone for the photo I took of the boots before dropping them off.]\nC: Nope, wasn't me, but let me see if I can get it off.\nFCL: [begins rant about how people are never pleased, etc.]\nMe: If you look at the shaft where it hits the sole, you can see that there are smears and splatters right there.  So, it was not like this.\nC: What do you expect for same day service?\nMe: [now fuming]  For you not to damage my boots that I'm paying you to repair.\nFLC and C: [Talking over each other. Alternatively making excuses about no one else offers same day and blaming me somehow for the shoddy work.]\n[C grabs another boot to clean off and I see that whatever he's using is making it worse by taking off the dye.]\nMe: Just please give me that back.  I already paid and I don't want you to clean them anymore.\nC: You really should buy a de-salting and waterproofing treatment if you're going to wear them in the snow.\nMe: I don't wear them in the snow.  Please just give me the boot so I can leave.\nC: Okay, baby.  Have a nice day, baby.\n\nDon't advertise \""While-U-Wait\"" if you're going to gripe and do a terrible job.\n\nWhat would have made me happy, you ask?  If the cobbler had admitted maybe he had made a mistake, voided the $40 dollar charge (the other $40 was the Groupon), and offered to clean them properly for free.  I would have even agreed to run the $40 charge again AFTER he'd restored the boot shafts.  But, instead, he was a total jerk.\n\nAdditionally, the woman \""working\"" the counter had no clue about prices and had random friends using up all of the chairs for customers both times I was there.  And both times, she ignored me for a good two minutes before screeching, \""You need something?\""  Rude.\n\nFYI, previously both my mom and I had repairs at Ullrich's back when the older Calabrese gent was working and they were at the old location.  The repairs were about 75% cheaper and the service was excellent.  Honestly, I think my family started going here because of the Italian owner (I'm a quarter Calabrese myself), but I won't ever go back.\n\nResults: After applying a leather cleaning solution and using a leather shoe brush/eraser, some of the marks are up but the rest appear to be permanent.  This is after 4 hours of scrubbing.  Ugh.  Pictures are posted of the damage for your viewing pleasure."
"2","I've been to Ullrich's twice and both times received excellent service.\n\n My first time at Ullrich's was to have the end caps of my heels replaced (for a second time). Initially I went to another repair store in Sq Hill and had them replaced -- but the replacement heels were totally wore out again within a couple months.  Went to Ullrich's to have them redone and after 6 months of hard walking, the heels are still wearing great.  \n\nI won't go any where else."
"1","I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay.\n\nI dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal, new heels, and a polish. I was very specific about the polish, because I wanted them to look nice. When I picked up my boots, I noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them. When I pointed this out to the clerk, she took them back to the gentleman in the back (the owner, I think). He said that the wax hadn't been buffed off. He gave them a quick polish and took $5.00 off the price. If he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny, that would have been the end of it. The problem was he gave them a  half-assed shine. After sitting for 3+ days with dried wax on them, a quick polish didn't remove much the dullness.  When I pointed this out to the gentleman, he said he had done the best he could. Quite frankly,  If that's the best he can do, he shouldn't be in shoe repair.\n\n I finally just gave up trying to make him understand why I was unhappy, because it was clear he wasn't going to help me, and he was becoming rude and unprofessional. I had made the mistake of prepaying. He had my money and had no more use for me. I think if I had owed him money, he would have taken my concerns more seriously, instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean. \n\nI wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative review about Ullirch's on Yelp (which also includes pictures) because it closely mirrors my own experience, both in terms of workmanship and customer service. The gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when he's taking your money if you foolishly prepay, but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work. Personally, I don't mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it. It's when you're abusive about your own error that I take offense.\n\nIf you do chose Ullirch's, do NOT prepay."
"1","This place is horrible. The cobblers do not know what they're doing. You can get better service elsewhere for cheaper.\n\nI came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half. There are logos on the bottom of the shoes and I told the cobbler to not cover the logos. The cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing. In the end, I found out that he ground down half of the logo on one of the shoes and covered it with the rubber protection. Also, he smeared the black glue (used to apply the rubber protection pads) all over the bottom of my shoes."
"1","I brought my boots here to get fixed. They did a good job however the lady was extremely rude when I came to pick them up. I won't be going here again."
"2","People always look at me like I'm nuts when I tell them that I get shoes repaired.  I guess the norm is to just throw a pair of shoes away if a heel wears down or a zipper breaks.  But I get attached to shoes, so a good shoe repair place is a must-find for me in a new city.\n\nUllrich's is awesome.  The owner (I think his name is Rex or Max? Something with three letters, anyway) is very friendly and will chat with you all day if you have the time.  They are reasonably priced (about $10 for a new zipper, less for a heel replacement).  Usually an order will take about a week for them to get to, but if you need it right away and you ask nicely, they can fix something while you wait.  I've had three pairs of boots repaired here now, and have been very pleased every time.  Highly recommended."
"2","Best deal for shoe repair! I've been trying to get my boots resoled but didn't have it in me to pay $50+ bucks that they charge everywhere else. I stumbled in here and they happily fixed up in a day for a mere $12.\n\nI mean this was after their painfully awkward attempt at small talk ...\""so you have family in Japan?\"" and \""you go to the gym a lot?\""... but I'll bear that much for a $12 fix up"
"2","Really good quality old school Italian in the downtown business district. \n\nGreat service, good selection and some great specials."
"2","This was a really pleasant surprise.  The normal Friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  She was going to be nice enough to go to \""Dish\"" although I know it's not one of her favs'.  Mantini's also came across the radar screen.  However, I wanted to try somewhere new and we both wanted to try something budget friendly.  Annie's Mom gave us an \""entertainment\"" book for Christmas and Papa J's was listed as an option.  I checked out the website and was less than enthusiastic.  Unlike its sister restaurant in Carnegie this spot has a stripped down menu.  I'm guessing because it does most of its business during lunch hours and maybe happy hour.  I called the restaurant and they did have many options not on the internet menu including a couple feature dishes (note to restaurant please update your website, you don't even list any pasta dishes as an option for the downtown location).  We decided to check it out after calling her brother Lee who goes often.  We get there around 730 PM last night (Friday).  Upon entering the extremely old (classic) building I'm struck by the interior which is truly \""old school\"".  It's dark wood, exposed brick, ornate lighting and the like...  There are a group of regulars I'd guess sitting at the bar imbibing loudly.  The bartender notices us and asks if we need a table for two.  We are then greeted by a friendly gal (JJ) who takes us to the back dining room which is a bit crowded and she senses our hesitation and takes us to the other side of the bar which only has a few patrons.  Annie confirms with JJ that we can use the entertainment card, she confirms and we save 12 bucks.  She brings us over some decent bread, unfortunately not served warm.  The bread is served along with the obligatory oil and vinegar mix.  She left a big bowl of parmesan cheese for us to add as much as we wanted which was a nice touch.  Annie started with the wedding soup which was okay, but not memorable.  I tried the potato soup, which was pretty tasty although a little bland.  Annie then ordered the chicken Romano which was really good.  The chicken wasn't too \""eggy\"" and the coating was almost light which is hard to accomplish with this dish.  In addition the portion size was pretty large and the chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry at all.  They also accommodated her request to have thin spaghetti for the pasta and serve with Alfredo Sauce, which they did for a dollar more.  The whole dish I think was $15.  I ordered the salmon with green beans.  It was a reasonable portion of fish cooked well.  The green beans were crisp and fresh.  The salmon was served on a chipotle pesto.  I found the pesto a bit overpowering and could have skipped it altogether, but if it did need to be served on pesto I would have preferred a traditional style pesto.  Service was spot on from start to finish.  I think JJ's family owns the restaurant.  We inquired about the rumors of the place being haunted and the former incarnations of this place being a brothel.  JJ took us down to the basement and showed us the underground tunnels that used to be used for the local politicians to make their way to the brothel unnoticed.  She also took us upstairs and showed us the Madame's bedroom (incidentally the headboard of the Madame's bed is now the bar downstairs (I took a picture and posted).  The whole meal with a couple of martinis was only $45 after the entertainment card discount not including tip.  And, we both had leftovers.  We stopped at the bar for a nightcap after dinner and the bartender said they are redesigning the menu and trying hard to make this more of a dinner spot than just happy hour.  There was also a band setting up as we left.  It seems like they are trying hard and I intend to be back.  However, be warned if you're looking for a hip happening spot a la \""tamari\"" this probably isn't it.  But, if you're looking for decent (3 star) food, great value and service you could do a lot worse.  I'll be back."
"1","Food was okay, but was very surprised that they have absolutely no handicapped accessibility. Steps to get in from the street, restrooms up the stairs to 2nd floor. No accessible stalls in restrooms. Surprising in this day.  NOT HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE."
"1","Boy do I have a few things to say about this place.  We had a large group before a theater show and I was excited to try a new place.  It's conveniently located for all downtown events.  They also have happy hour which is always nice.  Our large group was seated in a back room with two waiters.  One had about 40 years working there, the other had 2 months.  I got the one with 2 months, go figure.\n\nI'm on a budget right now and pretty healthy, so I planned ahead to get a caesar salad.  I decided at the time to add \""shrimp\"" (quoted on the menu as $2.50) and get a side of vegetables.  Now, the waiter said a lot of the dishes came with vegetables.  So I can order a side of them, right?  WRONG.  After I ordered, the waiter came back twice.  Once to tell me that they couldn't do the veggies.  Uh, what?  The second time to ask me how many shrimp I wanted.  hmm.  And he never refilled my water or asked if I wanted a drink.\n\nSo our food comes out and my salad is LEAVES and DRESSING.  Period.  The End.  Oh, with 3 pitiful shrimp on top.  That's it.  There was the powder parmesan on the table which I added myself.  So now I have 3 half broken, unseasoned, boiled shrimp with tails, lettuce and dressing.  Actually, everyone's food looked rather 'sad'.  Oh, but wait until I got my bill!!!\n\nMy lettuce, 3 pitiful shrimp, and self added powder parmesan was $18!!!!  The shrimp were $2.50 A PIECE.  For real real.  I wanted to throw down.  I could have had the salmon platter plus pasta for that.  What a rip off and so much for my budget.  \n\nWe had a big group but  my bill didn't have the tip added.  I was not happy with our idiot novice server so my tip would have been small.  Well, he brought me the credit card receipt and wrote in a tip himself.  Get me out of here!  Oh and because we were a 'group' they wouldn't accept one woman's coupon.  Weird.\n\nThe place is cool.  It's an old brothel and it's fun to look around.  But the upstairs is about 40 degrees colder than the downstairs.  The place is dated, but I liked it.  Intimate and creeky.  But jeez, go just for happy hour or a drink.  Don't put yourself through the misery and expense of what they call dinner."
"2","Have you met Frank? No? Well you'd better get on that, so you can brag to all your hipster friends that you know the best bartender in Pittsburgh.\n\nSeriously though. Best.\n\nWe found Papa J's at random on July 4th last year because, in typical Pittsburgh fashion, it was raining. We were en route from the Point to Station Square when the skies opened up, and the nearest bar to duck into was Papa J's.\n\nWhat you need to know first is that Papa J's is a historic landmark - it's the oldest standing former brothel in the 'Burgh. The wall behind the bar is actually fitted with a headboard (rumored to be that of the brothel madam), and there's a red light at the stairs.\n\nThe decor is all deep wood, low lighting, and mysterious feel. Better yet? Papa J's is rumored to be haunted.\n\n(Because if cocktails at a haunted former brothel doesn't get you excited about drinking in Pittsburgh, nothing will.)\n\nOh, and that's where Frank comes in. Frank is the friendly older gentleman behind the bar who will go out of his way to serve you the finest cocktails and martinis in downtown Pittsburgh. They've got a great house drink list (including a Bloody-Mary-esque beverage called the 'Angry Malkin'), but Frank also has a 'secret' list that only us 'real serious' Papa J's guests know about. \n\nFrank's policy is this: if you can give him the list of ingredients and he has them, he will make you any drink under the sun. If he makes it and you think it's great, he writes the recipe down in his notebook and recommends it to others. One of his specialties is the Black Eyed Susan. It's the signature drink of the Preakness, and he'll tell you the story of how he learned to make them (spoiler alert: it involves an A+ bartender going out of his way to help a sweet little old lady who loves the horses). \n\nAfter attending a Mixology class with Linda (that's Linda W. of Yelp fame!) where we made Prohibtion-era cocktails, I was in love with this gin drink called a Bee's Knees. It involves the use of honey syrup, which is not a common bar ingredient. Bless Frank's heart, he figured out some concoction of simple syrup and honey, and made me a Bee's Knees!\n\nYou can also choose to eat while at Papa J's, if you can tear your eyes away from all the drink menus. I recommend the bruschetta (almost always get an order of this - it's sooooo oniony, and sprinkled with cheese and a hefty serving of diced tomatoes - so good!), and any of the pizzas. Last time we stopped in, we had the chicken pesto pizza which had PINE NUTS on it!  PINE NUTS! (Those things are edging out beets as my favorite 'why-hello-there-how-did-you-get-on-the-menu' food in Pittsburgh restaurants lately.) The crust is perfect. I don't think I'll ever even try anything else on the menu, since I can't get past these awesome pizzas.\n\nSo, Papa J's is the perfect place to go if you want great booze and good food at decent prices in a neat atmosphere. They're in a great location downtown, and I've never had trouble getting a seat at the bar. I still haven't found any ghost activity, but as long as Frank is serving drinks, I'll certainly keep looking!"
"1","GREAT POTENTIAL POOR EXECUTION\n\nI gave this place a try on Wednesday night.  Thought it would be a fun place for some tapas and drinks with friends.  Took a ground of 7 friends with me.  The drinks were very good, nice selection of Champagnes and beers.  My big issues stem from a very bad waiter and a menu that wasn't updated.\n\nI ordered the Charcuterie, which included torchon foie gras and duck rillettes.  When it came out it had neither of the items I was excited about.  It had some spicy sausage and some prosciutto and fresh tuna salad (not a joke).  When I asked the waiter about it he had no apologies and just asked if I wanted him to take it away. (several stars off for that).  One of my friends ordered the Croque Monsieur (a fav of mine) which was ok, but not quite good.  It seemed as if it was made by a staff member instead of a chef who knew what he was doing.  Another friend ordered the Pulled Pork Quesadilla which wasn't exactly as described in the menu either, but not bad.\n\nThe waiter came by several times to check on our drinks, etc but twice he came over to the table with his arms crossed (a huge no-no with me.)  Plus, the waiter asked for a card to run a tab for our table?  (even bigger turn off.)\n\nOverall I thought this place had great potential but its execution was way under par.  It could have been an off night, but just not sure where there are huge issues like this."
"1","Based on the AWFUL service I received the last three times I dined here I will never, ever come back to this restaurant--and it is a real shame bc I really wanted to like this place.\n\nStrike 1 (and the biggest offense) Light Up Night - I called for reservations but was hung up on and told we didn't need them.  My party of 4 arrived at 5ish expecting a packed restaurant but the place was EMPTY.  We asked for a table and were told due to the amount of reservations it was going to be an hour.  I get that--but the place was EMPTY.  The host was NOT gracious about this, instead he seemed frazzled and bothered by our being there.\n\nWe sat at the super cool looking bar and ordered drinks and asked if we could order appetizers to the bar.  The bartender, who was a complete dick, said, \""I have a full house tonight, I'm not going to take food orders at the bar.\""  \n\nI'd like to mention this guy is apparently the bar tender at the Papa J's in Carnegie--not the regular bartender who is awesome.\n\nThe place is EMPTY.  We order drinks.  And we wait, and we wait, and we wait.  All the while we can see empty tables and I kept thinking...you know...if you had just sat us we would have been out of here by now!  So I asked the bartender who was helping the host...  \""Why can't you just seat us since the place is empty, its been an HOUR and we just want to know when you think we might get seated.\""  We would have left but honestly we were invested with our time at this point.  The bartender said, \""Well, for all the people who could take the time to make a reservation, we hold a table for them.\""  Well...yikes.  If this is how you act no wonder your restaurant has been dead every single other time we have been there.\n\nWhen we finally were sat, we were seated in a tiny table wedged in a room with a huge party that was three sets of parents and like, their 36 screaming children.  It was such a nightmare.\n\nTurns out they had the regular bartender waiting tables that night and he felt so bad about our wait and where we got seated he took one of the entrees off the bill.  So that was cool, but not enough to make up for his moron coworker.\n\nStrike 2 - If you go there for lunch and you order a hamburger, expect the waitress to give you attitude if you ask for cheese.  \""Yeah, if you didn't know this was an italian restaurant and we only have mozzerella.\""  Really?  I didn't know hamburgers were traditional Italian fare.  I wouldn't have been that upset but my hamburger--which was burnt, flavorless, and tasted like freezer burn along with my diet coke came to $14.00.  For a burger.  and a coke.  The prices here can be ridiculous.\n\nStrike 3-  Empty restaurant.  I mean, EMPTY.  My friend and i are there and we had bread wiith our meals.  Our thing of olive oil was empty, and there was a full thing of olive oil on the table next to ours.  NO ONE ELSE in the same dining room.  I took the olive oil off the table next to ours.  Our waitress came over and was like, \""Ma'am, this is not a free for all, you can't just take things from the tables if you need something you have to ask.\""  WTF!  There was no one there and it was just olive oil... and also had she been attentive, I wouldn't have needed to take the olive oil.  She would have brought us a full one.\n\nSo, I've tried this place 5 times and that was enough.  I dont know how it remains open but I suspect it will close soon.  Not worth the attitude of the staff.  They dont seem to appreciate the few customers they do have which is a shame, bc when I like a restaurant I recommend it and I bring my friends there."
"1","I'm not quite sure what happened to Papa J's in the past year....\nI remember always being delighted with my lunches in the past.  When a coworker suggested this last week, I was really excited to go back.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, everyone noticed all the dead fruit flies on the table. Yuck.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  He did mess up one order though, but she decided just to eat what they mistakenly gave her.  \n\nI had the Chicken Piccata.  I just love this dish.  My boyfriend's version is pretty top notch, so Papa J's had some high standards to live up to.  It was just meh.  The chicken wasn't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon.  All I could taste was citrus.  \n\nI also had a few bites of the Chicken Marsala.  Not sure the ingredients they used in this sauce, but holy crap was it sweet.  Really glad I didn't order that dish, I wouldn't have been able to eat it!\n\nI was really disappointed with this visit.  We probably won't be back any time soon."
"1","We wanted to check out the gay scene in Pittsburgh and since we were staying downtown this seemed like a great place. Positives: doorman was nice and they played good music. \n\nNegatives: the lighting, the decor and the smoking. The smoking was really disgusting actually as the smell lingered in our hair and our clothes after we left; I think they should consider opening up a little smoking area, just a thought. As for drinks, we ordered lemon drop martinis and I know, this is so far from being a martini bar, but the bartender did a pretty great job.\n\nGlad we went, but we won't go back."
"2","I've got a golden ticket.  I've got a golden twinkle in my eye.  \n\nWhile sadly I didn't get a golden ticket that didn't stop me from breaking into a ear to ear grin while simultaneously humming songs from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when I walked into Mon Aimee.\n\nIf you consider yourself a chocofiend you must go and gaze upon the rows of artisan and savory chocolates on sale.  If that wasn't enough they also have got an amazing gelato to tempt you with.\n\nYour tastebuds will love you for it."
"2","Awesome things about Mon Aimee:\n\na. Kind, knowledgeable, attentive staff.\n\nb. Excellent variety of chocolates from throughout the US as well as tons of international options. (two favorites: Poco Dolce from San Francisco and Eclipse from San Diego)\n\nc. New products appear frequently (exciting for a regular visitor)\n\nd. As other reviewers have enthusiastically mentioned, CAPOGIRO GELATO, dark chocolate flavor. Seriously, the best I've found in the US (...and by that I mean darkest chocolate. It's always too light elsewhere!). We're really lucky they distribute it in Pittsburgh. \n\nMy only caveat would be that for items you can find in the grocery store, such as Chocolove bars, you're better off grabbing them at Whole Foods, Giant Eagle, or Right by Nature - you may save about a buck per bar."
"1","For a place called Mon Amiee, this is the un-friendliest place I've ever shopped.  The elderly couple who oversee the premises make you feel as if you're about to commit a chocolate faux pas at any moment.  Come on, a smile would help.  \n\nThe selection here is stellar, but the prices are ridiculously high.  You can get the same stuff at World Market for $2 less a bar.  Even Whole Foods is less expensive.  \n\nNice gellato.  Good Chocolates. Expensive.  Grim staff."
"2","Holy.  Crap.\n\nI had never been in Mon Aimee before, not being a big sweet-tooth person, but when I was in the Strip last Saturday I stopped in.  My boyfriend and his mom do enjoy the chocolate, and I have to admit I was sucked in by the promise of \""lavender sea salt caramels\"" on a chalkboard outside.\n\nI was really amazed when I walked in.  It's just.....chocolate, as far as you can see.  Gourmet, imported chocolate.  And some other types of candy as well, in old fashioned glass jars, or artfully displayed on a table.  Candy from Asia, candy from Britain.  Chocolate from Europe, South America, Africa.  Some of the bars looked incredible - some were priced at $15 or more, which totally blew my mind.  They had an intriguing section near the front devoted to baking chocolate, with chips, whole bars, and cool things like butterscotch and white chocolate baking pieces.  They also have gelato, and some unwrapped candies that look fresh made, behind a front counter.\n\nWe bought the aforementioned lavender sea salt caramels, and a few other bars.  It's a pretty pricey store, but it was clearly an incredible place that any chocolate fan should explore.  It's hard for me to judge since candy is not my favorite, but I enjoyed what I tried.  The caramels were coated in dark chocolate and did have a really interesting, herbal quality from the lavender.  I also tried an Irish Whiskey truffle bar that my boyfriend got - I don't care much for dark chocolate so it was too rich for me, but i liked the creamy center.\n\nDefinitely for the chocolate fan - especially if you like dark chocolate, they have countless varieties of it.  Next time I stop in, I'll be sure to try the \""peanut butter heaven,\"" since that sounds right up my alley!"
"1","Talk about sucking the fun out of what, by nature, should be nothing but rainbows and sunshine and unicorns.\n\nThe staffer working here on our visit was so sour and unwelcoming that husband and I turned right around and walked out.  Too bad, too, because the place looked adorable and was packed wall-to-wall with unique confections of the chocolate persuasion.\n\nEven the pedagogical Oompa Loompas loosened up and danced every now and again."
"2","This was the first gourmet chocolate shop I went into and I spent a lot of time here debating what to buy - considering the chocolate melting during the bus ride, what I actually want to eat, etc. It was difficult choosing and I finally ended up with mik chocolate covered pretzels, a hazelnut chocolate bar and one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate Guittard bar. I really wish I bought more, but everything in the store was on the pricier side and I really didn't see anything else I liked. This is definitely a good place to visit when in Pittsburgh."
"2","I'm not sure where the complaints about the staff are coming from? My mom, sister and I went in there this past weekend and found the staff to be quite informative and friendly.  \n\nThis is a killer chocolate emporium.  Looking for that British chocolate from your semester abroad? Here is the place to go.  Needing a faux deviled egg for a chocolate themed picnic, have them in stock.  Looking for some of the more unique flavors in smaller sizes, check.\n\nPrices are high: some bars probably can be found at lower prices elsewhere but the range isn't available.\n\nI'm knocking one star off because the paths in the store are narrow making it hard for people with mobility issues to manuver.  Completely worth the stop if you are in the area."
"2","Mon Ami Chocolat has slowly won me over as a fan. My first visit it would have earned 3 or 4 stars. A varied selection of chocolates from around the world fills this store.... \n\nBut that is only the beginning! At the back of the store you can find (seasonally) a drinking chocolate bar that makes the cold Pittsburgh winters infinitely more bearable. \n\nBeside this, and especially welcome in the summer months is their Gelatto bar. I lamented the fact that my favorite flavor was nowhere to be found - Fig. Upon a later visit, much to my surprise, there it was! A fantastic treat that I can't recommend enough. \n\nAnother time I remarked that they had most of the chocolates from one particular company, but not specific one I had grown up loving... by my next visit, they had it behind the counter for me. (I hadn't special ordered it). I can't praise this kind of service enough! (apparently I wasn't the only one who asked, and it definitely took some doing to get this particular product imported.) Right then they won me over. \n\nOnly one product I'm still looking for here, when they start carrying Mekupelet, I'll be a customer for life. (Cadbury Flake doesn't count!)"
"1","great selection, nice store. Prices are high . I wish there was a courtesy card given for frequent big spenders. \n\nTHey pack t hings up well in summer m onths with ice if needed.\n\nI really wish they had samples because I dont want to buy a $15 bar if I wont like it......\n\n2 times i went there and they had NO hot chocolate...\n\nTOday, Jan 7th I am calling them but no answer to their phones to see if they are open\n\nThe service is most often rude. Owners just are not welcoming"
"1","The gelato counter was disappointing.  The woman who served us told us that it was \""rated in the top 5\"" gelatos in the country and added that it was \""from Philadelphia.\""  Isn't that the same as \""not made fresh in Pittsburgh?\""  \nWhen we asked if we could mix flavors, she said that we couldn't do that because \""it's too messy.\""  What she should have said was that the portion would be too small to able to mix.  She oh so carefully dipped less than a full scoop and dropped it in the cup.  The gelato wasn't good enough to be short scooped, even in a fancy chocolate shop in the Strip district.  Maybe they figure that the tourists who stop there won't be coming back anyway.  \nIf you find yourself at Mon Aimee Chocolat and want gelato, leave immediately and go to Mercurio's on Walnut St. in Shadyside.   There you'll find better gelato, more flavors, which you can mix, and you'll be served with a smile."
"1","I can only review the nonpareils and truffle sampler.   The nonpareils are very low quality dark chocolate and for 14.00 per pound definitely not worth it.   The truffles had two salted, one of which was milk chocolate.  They were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through.  I have to assume that the chocolate with  name brand wrappers are better than the ones they make in house."
"1","There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap, and I don't understand how they can use the term \""egg\"" in the name.  There's no way in hell that slimy yellow gelatin came from a chicken!   Absolutely horrible."
"1","I love going to the Strip and supporting the businesses in the neighborhood but you couldn't give me the produce from this place! Yes, it is cheaper but it's sort of like you get what you pay for here. \n\nThis summer I really noticed the items they put out on the street had mold right on it and very noticeable. One item in particular was their strawberries. I would think if your whole operation is selling produce you would take more pride in it. I tend to hit the farmer's market or Right By Nature. Yeah it's extra but I'd rather get better, quality food."
"1","Stan's has great prices OUTSIDE mostly because they things they have prepacked are spoiled and moldy or will be tomorrow.  Inside is just average quality, equally average priced produce."
"1","Cheap, everyone seems to say that.  And it's true.  But I wasn't feeling it here.\n\nI for one did not want to dig through the dirty to find the golden product.  I know it's in the strip, but I didn't appreciate the amount of bugs flying around me as I was browsing the produce.  \n\nThis will probably be a place I just walk by the next time I'm in the strip.  I did not enjoy it here at all."
"2","The price and freshness of the produce here is on par with most of the other vendors in the strip district. I'd recommend stopping by here to see which groceries are being discounted; those tend to be a good bargain."
"2","I stopped in at Klavon's last weekend for the first time. I stopped in around 8pm, and even though it seemed like the neighborhood was deserted, Klavon's was packed! Very popular spot!  \n\nIf you are on the Strip in PGH, you have to check this place out. Taking a step into Klavon's is like taking a step back in time. This place was originally an old drugstore/ soda fountain from the 1920's. The inside is all original complete with 3 old telephone booths, stained glass windows, beautiful counter top, fancy chrome soda fountains, and several glass display cases displaying items from times past! Stop in here for a quick lunch and a shake or an ice cream cone.. or share a $20 Super Bowl Sundae with friends.. if you dare! ;)"
"2","Lots of history at this place.  Once a drug store, now an ice cream parlor.  Be sure to read the interesting story of this place, and check out the flood line when you visit.  You can also sign their guest book while you're there.\n\nThe guys working here were extremely nice.  They were very patient while I perused their extensive menu.  They offer all sorts of ice cream creations such as floats, sundaes, splits, and milkshakes.  They even offer no sugar added and lactose-free options as well as flavored whipped cream.  In the end I decided on a single scoop of ice cream in a cone - how boring."
"2","Awesome place to go on a date. Cheap and super cute."
"2","This place is totally a trip, but so charming. Has anyone ever seen the movie 'Nothing But Trouble'? If so, this place was straight out of Valkenvania. Luckily, the ice cream was superb. I got the black cherry frozen yogurt and after one tongue swipe of my cone, I'd forgotten that I'd chosen frozen yogurt as opposed to ice cream. Can't wait to go back...even if it is totally freaky time warp."
"2","There are five reasons why you might want to go to Klavon's.\n1. You're in the Strip District anyway.\n2. You're interested in Pittsburgh history.\n3. You've never experienced an old-time soda fountain before.\n4. You're looking for some hard-to-find penny candy.\n5. You want some damn good ice cream.\n\nI went for all five reasons, and I wasn't disappointed. Wait. That doesn't express the depths of my enthusiasm for Klavon's. KLAVON'S RULES!!!!!!!!! There, that's better.\n\nLet's take it in order. You have lots of dining options in the Strip. Now, Klavon's is a few blocks away from most of the popular places (we were at Salem's, which is also great, but that's another review), but it's easy to walk to and easy to find with all the neon signs.\n\nWhen you walk in to Klavon's, you're taken back in time. Choose a little booth or table, and gaze at the decor. Maybe you'll see an old liniment bottle from back when Klavon's was a drugstore. Maybe you'll notice the high-water mark from the 1936 flood (close to the ceiling!). Maybe you'll see the old penny scale or the phone booths. This is a place where history is celebrated.\n\nThe menu isn't extensive, but you still have lots of choices. Why not try an old-time phosphate, malted, or egg cream? It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason? Both the root beer and the ice cream were made locally. On the way out, why not browse the penny candy racks? For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place. A glipse of his epic mustache alone is worth the visit, but he's always willing to give you a tour. Friendly people in friendly Pittsburgh. I can't wait to go back!"
"1","\""Could have bought it in a store\"" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a \""thanks\"" with my change.\n\nSo not worth the walk that we took to get here."
"2","Klavon's is a wonderful slice of history.  It's a beautifully preserved old time pharmacy and soda fountain.  Ray Klavon is the owner and the grandson of the original owner, and this soda fountain is an absolute labor of love.\n\nThere are selections on the menu that you can't find anyplace else...Depression Era Phosphates and also Egg Cremes.  My favorite ice cream dish is the Ballerina...which looks absolutely fabulous and tastes great.\n\nI love the old phone booth, the marble counters, and the other small details that indicate this place is the genuine article.\n\nI keep going back again and again, and I am always warmly greeted by the staff.  This is an especially nice place to visit by bike."
"2","Awesome"
"2","Just got back from a trip to the Burgh and of course Klavon's!!!\nStill AWESOME!!!"
"2","Stepping into Klavon's does give me a feeling of stepping back in time. \n\n1920's?! That's almost over 100 years ago. Maybe that's the good old days where you can find soda fountain together with medications?? \n\nThe staffs here are just like grandmothers too... Sweet smiling ladies taking our orders while my friend just could not decide what she wanted? Ice Cream Float? Ice Cream Sundae? or that Super Bowl Sundae ($25) that comes with 8 scoops of ice cream plus all the fixings!\n\nHere at Klavon's the ice cream selections are more traditional too. You find your good old, Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Peanut Butter Fudge.. 15 different ones to choose from. And make sure to request their special flavoured whipped cream!\n\nMy scoop of Toasted Almond Fudge ($2.80) so nutty and smooth. \n\nKlavon's Twenty-Eight Ice Cream Parlor is definitely neat place for a little time out if you are in the area! The experience will put a smile on your face!"
"2","One step into this place and all of a sudden, its like you've stepped into the 1950s.  Super old school, but quite cool.  The ice cream selection is not very extensive, but it sure does taste great.  Excellent service.  Just an old school kind of place that you'll have to check out.  I recommend the peanut ball ice cream."
"1","Needs a huge makeover!\n\nWe were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians.  Although we did determine that she was a bit over the top by the end of our experience.\n\nThe parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website.  The technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened.  It had the old time feel of a parlor back in the day but was very empty inside.  The character of the place was great but could use a little TLC.\n\nThe menu was very small and hard to read and understand.  It was only posted above the counter and the ice cream technician told us to take a seat.  Good thing I am far sighted!  \n\nThe ice cream technician could only take one order at a time.  She made my guest their ice cream first.  I ordered mine, chocolate, and cried vanilla.  She didn't listen at all.  I didn't return it because we had already been there for about 30 minutes and were running late at this point.\n\nI gave them a 2 star instead of 1 because the actual flavor of the ice cream was pretty good, vanilla or chocolate.  I adde strawberries to mine and received the typical strawberry topping.  I figured palace like this would have made their own strawberry topping.\n\nThe price was outrageous by my standards.  2 sundaes were $12.\n\nWe would probably try this place again if we were around but not making any special trips."
"2","Hands down, this is the best ice cream parlor in Pittsburgh. The ice cream is rich and creamy-- it has a distinct texture from other ice creams places... and it's miles away from store bought ice cream.... yuck. Even the presentation of your dessert is outstanding! \n\nThe decor is dated. It stands a fine line between the \""vintage\"" feel and just plain old. And it was in a sketchy area. I walked over from Chinatown, and there were no other businesses (or people) around. It's a diamond in the rough type place."
"1","Klavon's was a miss for my son and me. We came on a Saturday afternoon after walking the strip district. When we entered there were lots of people and and no structure for procedure in ordering. We sat at the bar and waited 5 mins or more to be acknowledged by employees who were making ice cream 24 inches away from us. Literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact. Just when I was about to get up and leave a lady said I'll be with you in a minute thanks for your patience. So I decided to stay and listen to her complain to another employee about a customer who changed her order from cake cone to waffle cone. Maybe that's a thing here in PGH or just the establishments I walk into where employees openly complain about customers in front of other customers.\nMy son only wanted a scoop of ice cream and I had a 1 scoop hot fudge sundae. Some how the total came to $7.38 for that. The ice cream was icy like the kind you would buy in those gallon buckets. \n\nToo bad. It's the kind of place that should be a treat not a 2 star review. Oh, the two stars were for the candy selection and old timey feel of the place."
"2","What a great place to stop on a beautiful Pittsburgh evening.  Our group of seven were greeted by two helpful and knowledgeable young ladies, Jessica and Courtney to explain all the yummy offerings.  They serve Penn State Creamery ice cream which is rich and creamy.  They offer custom made flavored whipped creams (chocolate, vanilla, pumpkin pie) To top their decadent sundaes and treats.\n\nThey also offer a variety of \""penny\"" candies and fudge.\n\nWhenever we need a sugar rush we will be returning to Klavon's!!"
"2","I can't believe I never knew about this place! It was a pharmacy back in the 1920's and now is a soda and ice cream place. The soda counter and everything is original, it's almost like stepping back in time!!! There are even the old phone booths ,and ask about the water line from when it was flooded long long ago! The hubby had a peppermint soda with a scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream that was really good, and we had a panini and chili that were also tasty. I hope to go back for more food soon!"
"2","This place gets a 4 star based on the decor itself. There is nothing like a classic ice cream parlor setting to take you back and provide its own unique experience. The ice cream is nothing special but its the booths and the menus and the pretty decor that really got me."
"2","We finally decided to take a trip to Klavon's. Funny- we actually were in such a hurry to get here that we both left without our phones.. which means we'll have to take another trip very soon to take pictures & show off our goodies! ;)\n\nThe menu consists of different sundaes, floats, splits as well as regular ice cream & treats (i heard one girl order a \""Pecan Ball\"" I've never heard of it, but it looked delish.)\n\nBobby ordered the Amaretto Sundae which comes with... well im not exactly sure so don't quote me. It had death by chocolate ice cream & multiple cherries as well as whip cream. I want to say it also had amaretto sauce but im not sure. I was too busy enjoying mine.\n\nI ordered the Turtle Sundae. It had chocolate ice cream, caramel and chocolate sauce & pecans. I got to choose my whip cream (!!!!) I chose chocolate. They also had caramel regular & amaretto whip cream (say whaaa?!) . \n\nI think the reason bobby chose his amaretto sundae is for the special whip cream, but i don't remember her asking. No biggie though! \n\n We only ordered the wee size (one scoop of ice cream) but that was more than enough to satisfy us. The service was extremely friendly by the way. We small chatted & she literally read our minds and brought us 2 glasses of water. \n\nIt was fun sitting at the bar and enjoying our sundaes. Can't wait to head back."
"2","Just found this gem.  This is a great place for every ice cream lover.  Great place to hang out with friends or to go on a date.\n\nI recommend the sundaes at this place.  This is pure 50's and 60's style that isn't forced.  Staff are very friendly and patient."
"2","My 93 year old grandma is an ice cream maven and Klavon's is her definition of heaven.  Our whole family loves going here.  I would give them six stars if I could.  But before my review, a word of warning - their hours on their website are completely inaccurate and not updated so don't go by the website alone.  As of writing this review, their hours are Noon - 8pm daily, I believe.\n\nKudos to the new owners of Klavon's.  The original family sold it about a year ago and the new owners are following right in their footsteps.  The people who work there are still so dang nice.  The place is so down to earth.  The original 1920s decor is still perfectly intact.  (Thanks for not going over the top and making this place cheesey old-timey.)\n\nVibe aside, their food is great.  They now use Penn State Creamery ice cream.  They have a decent sandwich selection.  The prices are really good."
"1","I had heard about Klavon's for some time, but never found myself in that area of the Strip.  The day I did, I did not hesitate to enter and taste the ice cream that had such excellent reviews. Firstly I discovered that there was new management. They definitely did not appear happy to see me enter. I was met with hostile stares. I approached and told them I had heard many good things about this store and its wares. No breaking of the ice. I ordered and was given a scoop of ice cream the size of a golf ball for four dollars.  Save your money and time."
"2","I came back here after the Tar and Feather party at Wigle Whiskey last night with a friend.  I'd been meaning to visit Klavon's again since it'd been a year since I'd last visited, so I suggested it, and my friend, who'd never been before, was game.\n\nI usually order a soda or float when I'm here, since this is the only place in PGH I know that makes them.  However, most of the flavors were fruity, and I was in the mood for some chocolate, so I decided to go with a sundae instead.  I ordered a regular sized peanut butter M & M sundae, which the woman serving me (who I assume is the proprietor) described as consisting of two regular sized scoops of ice cream.  It was huge!  The ice cream was vanilla with streaks of peanut butter, and the sundae had warm peanut butter and M & M pieces spooned into it.  The ice cream was very creamy and delicious, and there were no problems with freezer burns this time.  Overall, the sundae was great, if not quite what I was expecting.  Other than the M & M's, it lacked chocolate (I had assumed that the ice cream would be chocolate ice cream with peanut butter swirls), which was disappointing since I was looking for more of a chocolate peanut butter combo.  However, to be fair, this was more of an expectation issue on my part since the description of the sundae didn't say anything about chocolate ice cream or fudge, so I can't blame the proprietor for this.  Word to the wise: If you're seeking more chocolate, you may want to have them add some hot fudge!\n\nMy friend ordered the orange creamsicle ice cream soda, which consisted of vanilla ice cream and orange soda, and she enjoyed it very much. The only thing slightly amiss with it was that when she first started sipping it, the ice cream shifted, causing the soda to fizz up and overflow the mug. Since I'd been wanting to try this flavor, I asked her if I could have a sip and she obliged.  The flavor was very good, and I'd definitely order it when I return.\n\nService was friendly, if a bit slow.  The current owner has done a great job of maintaining the decor, down to the penny candy (I saw it this time!) and phone booths.  The only thing conspicuously missing is the scale, which I assume the original owner's family kept as a personal keepsake--but this is probably a good thing for dieters who'd rather not be reminded of their indulgence (ahem, cough, cough).  My friend really enjoyed the atmosphere, and said she'll definitely be back soon.  Despite trying to lose weight, I'm sure I will, too!  4.5 stars."
"2","Super Sundae."
"1","I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance when I was texted after I left\nA voicemail. It took a couple days to schedule as the woman, Retta, forgot her appointment book one of the days. \n\nWhen I showed up to my surprise it is looks like it would be a closet...right beside the elevator, no window, an office right next door that looks to take up most of the right side of the building. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried to open the door to go in...locked. Okay I think it's just one lady named, Retta. So I waited since my appointment was at 5 and it was 4:45. Around 4:55 I lightly knocked, nothing. I gave her a call and she didn't pick up. At this point I really had to use the restroom. I waited until 5 and knocked normally so that it would be heard. I sent her a text touching base and asking for the bathroom code. Around 5:05 I knocked again. 5:12 I called again and left her a voicemail letting her know I'd been waiting and would wait another 3 minutes before leaving and contacting Amazon local for a refund. I asked a few people if they'd ever been there and go the responses were all no. A few people I'd run into on my way knew where it was as they pointed it out to me. Around 5:15 the same men came back around and one knocked very loudly for me and they found me the bathroom code, thank god! So I come back at 5:20 and knock one last time. I left and have not heard from Retta and it is now 5:40. I'll be reaching out to Amazon Local for sure."
"2","This hotel is in a great location right next to the convention center and  is walkable to PNC Park, Heinz Field, downtown bars, etc. \n\nRooms are clean with high ceilings and comfortable beds and pillows. The TVs are vintage mid 90s but who watches that much TV in a hotel room? \n\nThe only negatives are the lack of free breakfast (though they offer coffee in the lobby) and the $22 rate per day for valet parking. Save your money and park at the city garage right down the street which is about $5 or so per day. \n\nThey have a business center you can use to check your email, use the internet, price boarding passes, etc. free right by the front desk. All the staff was friendly too. \n\nI would stay here again in Pittsburgh if I can get a good rate."
"1","I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years, but these greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would have cost them nothing. Where has good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe me - theres nothing special abt this hotel. The William Penn, the Doubletree, and several other hotels are FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates on Priceline. Heck - i'll even give a shout out to the Renaissance downtown -- it's not owned by the Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers!"
"1","When I checked in, the front desk staff was missing.  When I checked out, the front desk staff was missing.  The valets had to be chased down every single time I needed to park or retrieve the car.  When I called a week later regarding the charges on my account, the first call was disconnected.  On the second call, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I gave up.  On the THIRD call, I asked the clerk to email me a copy of a form, and she informed me that the scanner was down and she would be unable to for several days.\n\nThe pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator.\n\nDoes ANYBODY run the show here??  What a disgrace to the Marriott name."
"1","Literally worst service i've ever received at a hotel. Was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room. Also, policies like how much parking costs seem to change from visit to visit. \n\nTo sum up, i cringe thinking i'll ever have to speak to the people at the front desk again. The location is amazing, they have that going for them. \n\nDo not stay here. You will be disappointed."
"1","This hotel is well located. However the staff, especially Zac don't care a bit if you have elite status or not. The staff is young. The manager nowhere to be seen. No upgrades. Room has high ceiling. So what. Not personal at all strictly business. Restaurant no great shakes. One of three. The better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner. Bellhop seen limited times. To get a cab walk to the Westin across the street. Or take a bus. No hello on entering. Not friendly. So why stay here? Not a 4 star. Really a 3 star. Point redemption way too high. Nothing to recommend. Stay at the Westin across the street and kiss the staff there goodbye. Run. Don't walk away.  Not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful. \nLinda b august 2013 will never stay again!"
"1","Despite being a Marriott-brand hotel, Courtyard Pittsburgh Downtown's service and room qualities were not up to par with the Marriott standard but still charged Marriott price.\n\nI had a bad impression of this hotel before I even entered. I made a two-night reservation for a business trip, but I was stranded in an airport overnight because of cancelled flights. I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying. Eventually, I had to get my project manager to resolve this issue. \n\nBoth the room and the lobby were not spacious, although that's understandable given that the hotel was in downtown. What's not understandable was the creaking floor throughout the hotel floor, which amplified no matter how light my steps were. Good thing that I was not living below night owls, but that would not matter because the AC unit was too loud to get a good sleep anyway. Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me.\n\nSeriously reconsider if you decide to live here. Aside from sub-par room and service that are unusually low by the Marriott standard, note that the only available parking nearby will escalate the unjust price that you have to pay to stay in this hotel."
"1","Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine."
"2","This courtyard has had the renovation treatment that most are getting around the country. Not every room has a mini fridge yet but they can bring you one if you request. I had a room looking into the courtyard which is nice for sound but weird for having the blinds closed for privacy."
"2","Great deli.  Had a very good Ruben today.  Great food and friendly service.   I'll definitely be eating here again."
"2","More \""delis\"" should take a lesson in how to be good from this place.  My office is about 2 blocks away from the SSD and has been for about 5 years.  That means I've eaten here quite a few times.  And honestly, I've never been disappointed.  Actually, not living in Pittsburgh anymore, I've yet to find an authentic deli that's this all-around good here in Denver.  But don't worry, I'll keep trying.\n\nTheir sandwiches are huge and delicious - high quality (and quantity) meats and cheese.  The breads are delicious.  The soups are delicious - the stuffed pepper is to die for.  I used to find myself stalking the menu for stuffed pepper soup day.  Their chili is good.  Their salads are good.  Lots of folks in my office stalk the menu for taco salad day as well.  Do you see a theme here?   \n\nIt gets insanely busy at lunch, and there's not much space inside to move around and wait for your order, but it's a small price to pay for deli food that's this good.  You should eat here!"
"2","It's just plain good!  Whether you like a hot pastrami on rye or a plain ol' turkey sandwich this deli is the real deal!  Large portion sizes, free refills on soda, and the friendliest staff around.  Daily specials are a bargain and my own personal recommendation...the Reuben and the turkey Rachel are out of this world!"
"2","Pastrami sandwich(hot) was great. Tender and plenty of flavor. The only thing I didn't care for was the $14.50 for the sandwich, can of soda, and bag of chips."
"2","I religiously order the same thing at both locations and it is excellent each time: the turkey rachael on sourdough instead of rye. The matzo ball soup, while not like mom's, is still very tasty. Fellow diners I have eaten with have ordered the corned beef, the roast beef, and the pastrami and have raved about them all. I highly recommend this authentic deli."
"2","You'll love this deli! The sandwiches are enormous and full of delicious meats. They're known for their fish, but we didn't have that. The kids had big grilled cheese sandwiches. You MUST get the horseradish cheddar spread - you'll breathe better for days!! Their hours are kinda funky, so check before you head over."
"1","Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  \n\nI literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. \n\nWhen I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. \n\nThe attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. \n\nAs some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway."
"2","I came here last weekend to see Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre perform The Great Gatsby. The show was wonderful with amazing cherography by John McFall and Lauri Stallings of Atlanta Ballet. What amazed me just as much was the beatuiful theatre the performance was shown in.\n\nBuilt in 1927, the Benedum Center is awe-inspiring and magical.  After following strict guidelines, the theatre was restored to its original grandeur in the 1980s. It is one of the most beautiful theatres I have been in. with over 90 chandeliers, and original mirrors and marble in the Grand Lobby.\n\nMy only word of caution, the seats in the upper balconies are extremely tight giving taller people very little leg room."
"2","a great time!\n\nPROS:  \nPLENTY of seating\nan insane variety of shows!\njust a really pretty historic building\n\nCONS:\nParking is poo (bc there isn't any; you've gotta find a spot--I like the garage across from the Renaissance Hotel and then walk a bit)\nA bit old    (but that's really part of the charm for me)\n\nI've seen a lot of stuff here as a kid, but as an adult I've seen \nThe Beauty & The Beast (Phenominal)  [a few years back]\nand David Grey (which was an awesome show!!)  [March 2010]\nPhantom of the Opera - Farewell Tour  [September 2010]\n\n\n\n*I checked \""Good for Kids\"" only because they do offer children-centered shows.\nSome shows are also appropriate for kids depending on YOUR kids   ;)\nIf you have little ankle-biting heathens, then please don't take 'em and ruin the show for everyone else   ;)"
"2","THE place to catch touring Broadway shows"
"2","saw the austrailian pink floyd show 2 times and a doo wop show once. place was built when everyone was 5'5 150 lbs.\ni am 6'3 270 lbs ,so its a toyt squeese for a 2 hour concert. but the sound and just the atmosphere makes me forget my knees are loc ated behind my ears. red carpet on the walls makes me get all giddy. betcha a cat would go ape in a place like this. hope its open forever."
"2","I recently attended La Traviata here.  Great show!  The Benedum is a fantastic facility for the arts and a true asset to the Pittsburgh region.  The only reason why it is not 5 stars, is they need to update the downstairs, and possibly the upstairs bathrooms.  They were a little outdated and lacked the elegance of the rest of the facility.  Nevertheless, a very fine theater."
"2","I always love coming to the Benedum.  We attended Wicked on a recent Sunday night.  I am always astounded by the beauty of this theater.  \n\nHere are a couple interesting facts:  The mirrors, marble and woodwork in the Grand Lobby are all original.  There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  \n\nWe had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that?  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.  And while the seats are showing some signs of wear, the good news is the 2,881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450,000.\n\nYou know, it always feels really special here.  No matter what event we attend.  Looking forward to coming back during the holiday season."
"2","Saw Phantom when it came through. Grew up seeing Nutcracker every year. JC Superstar was awesome. Beautiful place and Pittsburgh is soooo lucky to have it!"
"2","I love it here! It is like walking into a little piece of history, I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day. \n\nFurs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. \n\nBut my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. \n\nI don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late \n\n(Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. \n\nI appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay. \n\nCue in Detroit, sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,"
"2","Great theater !!! Absolutely beautiful .. Live the seating ... Seen Book of Mormon here !!! Loved it"
"2","Mom forgot her cane in the coed restroom.  Mom went to see Evita.  She says the lead performer got a standing ovation.  Mom said the people attending the event looked decent but they weren't really dressed up.  It was such an older crowd that they came and left in Access SUVs and a school bus.  The opera noted that they started in Oakland in someone's living room and the opera has been in Pittsburgh for seventy-five years.  Mom said the venue was packed but the last three rows were empty and that's where she sat for her rush ticket.  Mom said this place was pleasant because of the calm crowd.  When I asked mom how multicultural the crowd was.  She said there were a few groups of Chinese people and a few African Anericans,"
"2","This is my first time here and definitely not my last.  An absolutely beautiful and historic theater with a pretty bad- chandelier, if I do say so.  If you want to experience the best of what this city has to offer, visit the Benedum.\n\nThe bf and I came to see Elf the Musical for our anniversary.  I was blown away by the beauty of the Benedum!  The ceilings!  The lighting!  The candied almonds... Ok so I bought those ... I smelled them them minute I walked in.  It's part of Buddy the Elf's food groups, so I'm allowed right?  Ok ok I'm not here to review the show, I'm supposed to review the Benedum.\n\nThe Benedum has all of the features a classic theater had to offer - cathedral ceilings with the gold leaf and naked babies, massive chandeliers, huge archways, and the feeling that history took place here.  So come and visit one of the many shows at the Benedum.  \n\nExcuse me while I enjoy my nuts."
"2","I have seen several shows here over the years. Most recently, I saw wicked, which was amazing!!! The one thing I really have to applaud about the Benedum is that the seats are all pretty good. I am on the shorter side and have never had trouble seeing, no matter where I was seated."
"2","I've been to the Benedum plenty of times (all for musicals) and I've always had a good experience. Being a fan of the theater, it's always fun to put on some nicer clothes and see a show. \n\nThe theater itself is beautiful. Complete with a huge chandelier and detailed ceiling art, the place itself is a sight to see. The hallways and staircases are a bit old, but it gives it a nice vintage feel to better your theater experience. \n\nOne complaint I do have is the \""lobby\"" area is kind of small making leaving the theater a bit of a hassle. Not to mention, the merchandise and snacks stands are there as well, making everything even more tight. \n\nAlso, just a little tip... Being a college grad paying my student loans, I unfortunately don't have enough money to get front row seats. I usually buy the bargain seats in the back for $10-$20 dollars. What's cool is once the show begins you can move up to seats that aren't occupied. You may pay $10, but end up sitting in a $40 seat. However, be prepared to be a little lost. It's hard to hear what some of the actors are singing due to being way up at the top and not being able to read their lips. I'm sure the sound feedback has a lot to do with it as well."
"2","A beautiful theater, no doubt.  It's absolutely stunning.\n\nSeating however?  ARghhh... Can only vouch for the first balcony tier.  These have got to be, by far, the most cramped seats I've ever encountered, Boston, MA and NYC included.  I get that they will be somewhat confining; but, seriously, I'm 5'5 and my legs were crushed against the seat in front of me.  The thought of crossing my legs at any point was merely a thought; it wasn't gonna happen -- no way.  \n\nSo, while renovating it never occurred to anyone to arrange seating with a wee bit of space?  I mean even airlines have more space (yeah, yeah, by only mere inches, but it counts).  \n\nOne plus was the ladies restrooms.  There are enough to accommodate and the line went surprisingly fast.  \n\nFour stars for the beauty; definitely not for the seats."
"2","The Benedum Center is home to some of the finest productions currently on tour. I've seen some of these musicals on the Broadway series in the cramped Broadway theaters themselves so it is refreshing to be able to see that same show from a larger venue.\n\nIt is true that if you have seats to the far right or left then you will miss both the scenery and what happens on that side of the stage but that is true with most any theater. I find that if I am unable to get good seats and must sit far away or in the balcony then I bring some \""opera\"" glasses to help me get a close up of the stars and the action.\n\nIn addition to musical theater the Benedum Center offers special performances like the Nutcracker or special singers or groups depending upon the time of the year.\n\nNormally the CLO now has this new gimmick going on where they will take a picture of you for free in front of a show marquee and then post it on Facebook so you can download the image.\n\nIt does have handicapped accessible access as well as free listening devices for the hearing impaired.\n\nThey do have narrow areas for gift shopping as well as for purchasing beverages and snacks on two of the levels along with the basement. On the first tier there are lounge areas where you can just relax before or during intermission. The rest room lines are long but move quickly enough so that you can return to your seat in time for the 2nd act.\n\nThey also offer some VIP packages where you get special \""perks\"" along with better seating for more money. I am taking advantage of one of these perks next year and will update this review to see whether or not my investment was worth it.\n\nSadly however, they don't always inform you of special name entertainment unless you are a donor. I've missed out on a couple of these attractions for that reason. Still the ticket prices are way less than what you'd pay to see the same show on Broadway and I feel it is worth your money."
"2","I love the Benedum. Really there's not a bad theater in Pittsburgh, but this just has my heart. Recently just saw the Nutcracker, but have seen many a show here. \nPlenty of parking garages in the vicinity so not a far walk once parked downtown. Great restaurants nearby. \nPricing is good, too. I love that they offer discounts to teachers. Yay! They also do student rush tickets, too I believe. \nTrust Arts gets a great selection of shows to come to Pittsburgh so you can see a great Broadway series production in your hometown or if you visit Pittsburgh. And, in that case this is something to do on your visit. \nI sat most recently in the orchestra seat which are nice. I prefer the director's circle above so you don't have to dodge a head in front of you.  I did once sit in 4th row orchestra and well, that's pretty damn awesome! \nI will always be back to this theater."
"1","I've been here twice. Both times, I pulled up and sat waiting at the entrance, and some guy from the shop next door had to run over and notify someone of my presence. The second time I was actually backing out of the driveway to leave and the guy chased me down. \n\nIf you ask to have your wheels cleaned, the attendants use brushes on them. These same brushes are used on the exterior of your car. Car nuts have an adage of \""don't use on your wheels what you use on your paint\"" but we can forgo that for this review. My gripe here is that I ended up with scratches on my wheels. My car isn't anything to write home about so I'm not particularly worried about scratches in my paint, but if you have a newer/nicer car, I would look out for this. \n\nOne thing I like about this place (and a star redeemer) is that your car is hand dried at the end. Going along with that extra star is the fact that the people here are nice and aren't trying to screw you over; the quality of the wash could be better though. \n\nGo here, get the cheap wash, leave with a clean and dry car."
"2","When you come to this place it really looks like a dump but once you enter you get a really good service depending on how busy they are.  I haven't seen a place better in pittsburgh but they scrub your exterior with brushes to get the hard to get off bugs and dirt.  The car wash is automated as well and hand dried.  I got the platinum service which cleans the inside as well and they did a great job.  There were a few things that they missed but when I told them about it they took care of it.  When cleaning the car they even cleaned the door hinges area meticulously.  I was very happy that Pittsburgh has a decent hand car wash place and good detailing.  There is always room for improvement but these guys did a great job.  I would definitely go back again.  Keep looking at their website for specials they have 3x  $16 dollar car washes for $24 sometimes.  Great deal."
"2","A good bar with OK food.  \n\nFairly diverse menu, so you dont have to have a burger, etc."
"2","I have only one thing to say... Garbage Burger. Max and Erma fans know exactly what I'm talking about. When in the burgh go to Max and Erma's for a garbage burger!"
"1","Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite was the tortilla soup. That was actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable. Especially when we were the 2nd table seated of the day."
"1","Stopped In before a show at Heinz Hall.  It was not crowded, but the waiter was almost useless.  He did not know the beer list, drinks went unfilled, etc.  Plus I was served teriyaki fajitas.  That's right, these were the oddest fajitas I have ever been served.  The taste was OK, but it is not what I expect fajitas to be.  That said, my wife's Reuben and son's fish and chips were OK.  Overall it was just OK food served by an incompetent waiter."
"1","I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner , to recognize their high PSSA scores and over all academic success so far this school year.  What can I say the kids just love this place.\n\nFor me the food was terrible.  I wouldn't even have cooked this way for an enemy. I got the cabo shrimp salad. This was four tiny dried up shrimp served in a bowl with ice berg lettuce an rotten tomatoes.  \n\nThe kiddies had Beatlejuices which is grape juice and Sprit with a gummy worms. They also had Oreo milk shakes which they demolished and said were super yummy. \nEach of them for dinner also had a cheese burger. The burger was juicy and delicious. \n\nI have to comment on th bathrooms. They are in terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls are broken so instead of fixing the toilet paper rolls Max and Erma's just sit the roll of toilet paper on top of the broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!"
"1","I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet, stating that it was some of the worst Chinese food I've had.  Well, this place manages to be worse than it.\n\nThe place is rather run down.  The buffet was really terrible.  Food left to sit out in just its oil and a barely lit heat source.  It just wasn't a great environment.  Try something else, definitely!"
"1","The food at this place is at best mediocre, but it deserves something better than 1 star given the good service. Every other place in the neighborhood was either packed or seemed like it would have slow service so we decided to come in here despite it looking like it was closed with no one inside. We were served very quickly, as promised, and it's not the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I know, that's not saying a lot, but given the limited options in the area, it may be worth knowing about this place as a possible alternative."
"1","1.5 stars.  I agree with Eszter, this deserves 2 stars only because of the service.  A sad little \""Chinese\"" buffet with a smattering of overcooked options.  Soups were borderline offensive.  There probably won't be a wait!"
"1","I can't tell you how bad this place is, regretted not looking up on yelp for reviews before ordering for delivery.\n\nSeriously this place has the worst Chinese food I've had in my whole life!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","I think I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets. Liang's buffet is not great. It fills your stomach but that's about it. Their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so Chinese food. On the plus side, service is good and there are times late at night when this restaurant is the only one along this block still open. That's worth keeping in mind if a convention is keeping you busy until late at night."
"1","Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!"
"1","This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business."
"1","Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat."
"1","Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!!"
"2","I love this store! \n\nAre you looking for -\n\na selection of stuffed rats?\n\nsunglasses shaped like martini glasses or dollar signs or hearts?\n\ncheap Pittsburgh mugs or magnets?\n\nIC Light or Steelers merchandise?\n\nold fashioned candy?\n\nparty hats?\n\nOk, you get the idea. This store is STUFFED full of all kinds of things that you will suddenly absolutely need and it's reasonably priced. It's also the perfect place to buy some junk to take home to your friends :)"
"2","This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia."
"2","An e-mail conversation with a fellow Yelper yesterday reminded me of how much I love stinky food.  So I had to satisfy my craving for such today with a nice kielbasa (or is that kolbassi) from Wiener World.  M-M-M-M load that baby up with onions!   Dee-lishous!  Now will someone please pass me the Listerine?\n\nI also promise I'll hit the treadmill and the elliptical trainer tonight!"
"2","What's this, a fifth review of a hotdog stand?  Read on o' Downtown diners!\n\nIt figures.  The other day I was telling my Yelp friend Mike O. about my sudden lunchtime craving for encased meats.  I figured hey, it being a nice day why not get a dog with all the goodies on it and dine al fresco?  It's mid-October--how many more outdoor dining days are we gonna have?  So I got me a regular dog loaded up with all the goodies, fries, and a drink.  Mmmm-mmm good, right?"
"1","They charge $4 for a hot dog that is not any different from one you can get at any 7/11 for $1.  Not sure how to review it other than to say have you ever gone into any gas station convenience store in America and gotten a \""big dog\"" or whatever, and put condiments on it?  It's the same thing but 3 more dollars.  They did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive.\n\nI hate supporting chains but independent places are supposed to offer something more unique than a neato neon sign.  You might pay as much for a dog in Chicago or New York but they're something special.  For less the amount I could have gotten a corn beef sandwich at various places nearby.  Liked the people and the atmosphere.  Next time I'll try the ice cream."
"1","I've had fish sandwiches all over Pittsburgh, it's a staple of the burgh diet and one of the dishes we do best.  Sadly Wiener World does it worst.  A bad fish sandwich in Pittsburgh is like bad BBQ in Texas or a bad cheesesteak in Philadelphia, an offensive abomination that denigrates the pride and reputation of the region.  I have never had a worse fish sandwich anywhere (including in fast food hole in the walls) and at $10, this assault on your taste buds doesn't come cheap.\n\nIt was bad in every way it could be bad.  Frozen, greasy, tasteless, heavy on bland batter and light on fish.  To add to it, even though the inside of the establishment is large, there are no chairs to sit down (just counters), they don't take cards (cash only, but they do have an atm) and the inside was freezing, I was shivering in the 60* temperature even though it was 80 outside in July.  \n\nSo why do they get 2 stars instead of just 1?  My server was very nice, the fries with the sandwich were prepared fresh and were good, and I've heard from many reputable sources that their ice cream is fantastic.  That said, I'll be licking my wounds from disappointment for a while before I lick their ice cream."
"1","Every time I come here, hoping, just hoping that I'm going to have a couple delicious hotdogs. Raw. Unfiltered. Old school. Like a ballpark from the 1920's or something.\n\nBut each time I come away disappointed, even more than last time.\n\nMy father worked here three or four decades ago. I'd love to love this place and recommend it to my friends.\n\nThe service is anywhere from good to great, and they are fast and friendly!\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I come when the hotdogs have been sitting on the grill too long. At odd hours. or an hour after the rush.\n\nEvery time, the hotdogs (and brats) are harder than a rock.  Not a snappy casing, no, this is like barely edible hard exterior.\n\nSo what's a man to do? Try again?  Sadly, I'll probably forget about my recent experiences, and try them again.\n\nI just hope they are fresher next time, because I can't imagine them worse than today."
"2","I love a good hot dog and this is a good hot dog place.  The people working were incredibly nice and helpful people.  The inside as others have said just has a standing bar against a wall and that's it.  The hot dogs were full and plump and had good flavor.  They have plenty of options for toppings on the dogs.  I also got fries and a malt.  The malt was very good and the fries were just your standard average fries.  All in all if you like hot dogs you should try this hot dog joint."
"1","I like a dive restaurant as much as the next person, but this is not my kind of place.  It smelled dirty, the bartender and the lady who took our orders were both very unpleasant, and the food didn't taste fresh.  It just doesn't look clean in there, so that is a major concern.  You can be a bit hole-in-the-wallish, but you still need to keep the place clean.  Our table smelled like a moldy washcloth had been used to wipe it.  Won't be eating there again."
"1","I don't understand why this place think's it has famous Corned Beef. I can only believe it's because there are no other deli's downtown.  The restaurant/bar is a dive.  The Corned Beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special.  Not worth the trip."
"1","I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time"
"2","Fish fry what what!  I must have literally walked past our Daily Bread Cafeteria 3000 times always seeing the open doors, always reading the daily specials but never stopping but today I  put my bustling on hold to get in on the Lenten specials. \n\nFor a mere $6.15 I got a filling home cooked or rather church cooked lunch. My lunch included fried cod mac and cheese and stewed tomatoes with a roll and butter.  I detected salt free cooking but the fish really popped once I added house made cocktail sauce. The stewed tomatoes were great and were prepared with garlic and green peppers. \n\nFor my first fish fry it was a great experience."
"1","If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.\n\nUnfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to \""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.\""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches, like this one, wanted to preserve the sanctity of the ceremony than their rules should apply to all, not just the people hired by the couple to be there."
"1","Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church."
"1","It took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasn't even busy.  When the food finally came it was bad.  We never received an apology.  The prices are cheap, but it's not worth it."
"1","After a long morning meeting at the beautiful August Wilson Center on Liberty Ave. My coworkers and I needed food ASAP! We decided to go right across the street to Mahoney's! It didn't look like it would be pricey or the food would be bad. \n\nAs you walk in you immediately see the bar area with TVs and Bar stools, as you walk in a little further the tables are set up in the back with plenty of room. A different set up that you don't see often, but I really liked it. \n\nThe food was typical bar food, but with a little more pizazz. The 1/2 sandwich soup and sandwich combo was actually smaller than I had hoped. The food itself was not too bad. Not my favorite. The French Onion soup was a bit salty and the mayo for the sandwich seemed warm. I tried the fries which were good but a bit too greasy for my taste. \n\nMy friend's Greek salad however was very tasty. It had a great mixture of greens, feta cheese and even potatoes! \n\nThe staff was nice and the prices were good. \n\nA place I would go back to but not regularly. Maybe try a happy hour there?"
"1","The food was terrible! I got the crab cakes and they were mostly bread crumbs. Two people at our table got the crab bisque and neither could take more than 2 spoonfuls. It was a Wednesday at 7:30 and the restaurant was completely empty besides our group. We quickly found out why. I would NOT recommend this place for food."
"1","This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice, despite its small size.  However, the location had a poor beer selection when we visited and appeared to be out of at least 3 of their draft selections. For well drinks, my girlfriend typically drinks vodka and cranberry and noted that their pour was very weak on vodka."
"1","Mahoney's is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening. Don't go!"
"1","I am not digging the set up here the bar stools have arm rests which are fine  if the chair swiveled which it didn't and it was very awkward for me to get down with out the person next to be having to get up.\n\nThe bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable. There  is apparently a small collection of dictionaries and thesauri that are keep  above the register that are in serious need of a dusty.\n\nI won't  be back soon."
"1","After a work happy hour a few doors away, several of us were looking for a place to eat, and were having a hard time deciding. I was the pain in the tukkhas, since I'd driven my antique car, and kind of needed to be able to park it where I could see it, plus, I'd really planned the evening to be a birthday dinner for one of the co-workers. We decided to split up, and me and the birthday girl go somewhere, and the rest would hit something within walking distance. Then as Birthday girl and I got to my car, we realized we were parked in front of a restaurant, and Mahoney's won out by default.\n\nWe should have gotten in the car and driven somewhere else.\n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant enough, but the food...yeesh.\n\nEveryone placed their orders, mostly sandwiches of one variety of another, sided with fries, plain or sweet potato, or slaw. I ordered the Reuben hoping for the best, but definitely not receiving it.\n\nMichael's chicken breast with plain fries arrived with sweet potato fries, and instead of just bringing him a side of regular fries, they took the whole plate back to make the switch. Kim's turkey Rachel arrived, and as it was handed in her direction, half of the stuffing fell off the plate and onto the floor. The server took the plate back to the kitchen so that Rachel could be re-stuffed, and for the rest of the evening her initial guts laid right there on the floor. Kim #2 had a fried fish sandwich, which looked a little withered, and then there was my Reuben. More like an Ewwwwww-ben.\n\nThe bread was dry as chalk, and the corned beef had been so overdone, it looked like bacon sticking out of the bread. Dry, dry, dry...and I took maybe two bites of the slaw, and that was quite enough.\n\nThe prices aren't steep, but seriously people, take some pride in what you're handing off to a customer. Would YOU eat that?? Seriously, put that order down on the counter in front of you...and take one minute to LOOK at it...then make one exactly like it for yourself. Are you gonna eat that? If not, um, why would we want to pay for it?\n\nThe service was pleasant enough, and the atmosphere was comfortable enough for nice conversation. But would I go back? Nope. The food, my reason for going to a restaurant, was dreck.\n\nMy apologies to my co-workers for forcing them to try it along with me."
"1","I love to try new places when traveling and my wife was interested in something \""mild.\""\nFrom their menu on the web it looked like Mahoney's Restaurant had a good selection of American favorites.\n\nThe restaurant was close to our hotel so we walked over and go there about 5:30 pm on a Thursday.  It is a bar with larger dinning room, we were seated in a private booth, which was nice because they had a curtain between the booths so it was a nice secluded place to enjoy a meal... I just wish I had enjoyed the meal.\n\nMy wife and I were the only people in the bar/restaurant. We were waited on immediately and our service was good.\n\nWhile the web site is nice, their menu in the restaurant's printed menu was almost impossible to read.  I do not know know who picked the font but the number one rule when picking a font is to make it legible. I liked the fact they had descriptions with each menu item but trying to comprehend the message while reading \""through\"" the font was not fun.\n\nMy wife picked the cheese burger and fries.  I picked the fish sandwich and sweat potato fries but then changed to plan fries when I learn they put sugar on the sweet potato fries, it was nice of the server to let me know this information.\n\nFood came out quickly.  The fries were home-style with skins on and they tasted just like my homemade fries, greasy and soggy.  I love fires but I did not finish mine.\n\nMy wifes burger was cooked well done as she liked them and she was afraid it would be dry but it was not she liked it and she liked the crispy toasted bun.\n\nMy fish sandwich was in one word \""yuk.\""  I have never seen fish that thin.  It came with a tiny drop of tarter sauce in a plastic container, I asked for more when the sandwich was served and got one more drop of sauce, which might have been enough if the fish had not been so over-cooked that parts of it could not be chewed and swallowed.\n\nI had to keep picking out hard, long stands of fish from my mouth as I tried to eat the fish.  There was one long piece of fish and one about 1/2 the length of the other, the perfect amount of fish.  The breading was well flavored but the fish was so over-cooked I did not enjoy it. Our serve was nice to refill our drinks but he did not come back to ask if we need anything so I could not ask for more sauce, I used ketchup to try to finish the meal.  I know there is a balance of giving dinners privacy and service, so I do not blame the server for not coming back to ask how things were going.  He did bring the bill and process the bill quickly at the end of the meal but never did ask, \""how was everything.\""  Good thing he did not ask because I tell the truth when asked.\n\nWhen we left there was only 2 other couples in the place and I think one was related to the owners.\n\nI will not be back and if you have other choices, I think I would recommend trying them before Mahoney's Restaurant.\n\nBecause my wife enjoyed her burger I can not give them one star but if you get a burger skip the fries and go for some other side.  Their prices are very affordable."
"1","We went on a random Thursday night for dinner.  Our expectations were thinking this local establishment might be a great local pub with sub par food.  This is what we found. \n\nOur server was friendly enough and welcoming, but dining room area is out dated decor.  Food was not awful, but just barely average.  I had a salad and my husband had a fish sandwich.  They arrived quickly, were reasonably priced and by friendly staff, but the food was nothing special.  Nothing unique or notable about either one. \n\nThe bar area up front seems like a small, local friendly place to go after work, but I would skip the food."
"2","To die for, especially for those who are crazy about coffee!! This place serves great coffee and also sells the widest array of whole-bean I have ever seen.  It is fun to sit and sip on a cup of coffee while they roast right in front of you.\n\nThe biggest selling point for me was the outstanding array of fair trade coffee they had to choose from!  Thank you, Fortunes!\n\nThis place is definately great to grab a good book and chill out for an afternoon on the Strip District!"
"2","Oh, heyyy-ayyy, buried bookmark.  Nice to see you again.\n\nFortunes served the best coffee we tried in Pittsburgh and had the most engaging and upbeat baristas.  Best part is the old-fashioned coffee roaster and barrels full of beans.  Lift, sniff, pack a bag for home.  I truly appreciate a self-contained coffeehouse doing everything on site.  And Fortunes is a completely unassuming and modest one.  Even better."
"1","no. no. no.  $5 credit card minimum.  no bathrooms . . . and you sell coffee? good brew but why bother having tables if you don't have a place for customers to go?"
"2","I go here to buy coffee and for the occasional espresso before work.  The coffee has always been high quality and inexpensive - most varieties are around $10/lb which is certainly cheaper than any other whole bean you can find, even in supermarkets.  (that 8 oclock crap is roughly $8 for a 12 ounce bag, meaning $12 a pound, for THAT).  I am a dark roast fan - big fan of Fortune's French Roast and Espresso Roast.  They have a variety of dark, light,. blends, flavored, and decaf.  The people there have been consistently nice even when I went in the first time and didn't know how to work the grinder because I'm a jagoff.  The way the cafe is set up reminds me of the cafes in Italy where you are meant to come in, throw some hot espresso down your throat, maybe sit a while if there are any chairs open, maybe chat a while before going about your day.  I have no complaints."
"2","Good Coffee and Travel Advice!  What more can you ask?\n\nA buddy and I decided to explore the strip district one Saturday and found this gem of a coffee shop.    We ordered a couple a Cappuccino's.    The employees were very nice and provided some good insight on what to see and visit.\n\nThe Caps were good, the vibe was great and it is in the heart of the Strip District.   A strong recommend."
"2","First I want to say I LOVE coffee & I don't even understand the people writing reviews on here that DON'T drink or like coffee!!!!  So please look at the reviews of actual coffee lovers!!   I LOVE the Fortunes Coffee's.  We don't live there but stumbled into this place while walking down the Strip District.  I bought their Pumpkin Spice coffee & brought it to my son's house there to brew.  It was AWESOME!  So I had to go back & buy plenty more of both reg & decaf.  Now everytime we go back to Pittsburgh we have to go there & stock up.  If you want good tasting coffee, get it there!  The people there are very nice & helpful also!  I am drinking a cup of their coffee right now here in Florida & about to order some on their website!  YUMMY!!"
"2","The Wood Street Galleries is a small gallery located in the heart of downtown above the T station.  It has a layout similar to the Mattress Factory, but smaller (only two floors... usually with two to four installations per floor) and it usually, but not always has installation art.  Sometimes the installations are really awe-inspiring (in my experience about 75% of the time); sometimes not so much.  Admission is always FREE!\n\nDetails: To get inside, you need to enter through the door at Sixth and Wood St. (pretty sure about this...).  From there, take the elevator (only one and kind of small) up to the 2nd or 3rd floor, where the actual galleries are.\n\nSome advice: Try not to go during one of the quarterly Gallery Crawls because there'll be a looong line for the elevator to get in."
"2","I wish more people knew about Wood Street Galleries! It's right in the heart of downtown and admission is FREE. you get to see great art and/or displays. Bobby and I always find ourselves here to escape the hectic downtown scene. They are closed Monday and Tuesday I believe. I'm always amazed at the different types of displays they have. Another great thing is that the displays are up for 3 months at a time, so if you really like something, you have the opportunity to go check it out again! :)"
"2","The gallery is right above the Wood Street T/Bus Station and can easily be missed, well at least that was the case for me. Having gone through that station at least few times a day during my college days - I never once realize there was a gallery above the station.\n\nSince last year's gallery crawl - I've gone there few times including during this year's gallery crawl. Depending on your view towards art - this place can be pretty interesting with their showcase of some unconventional art piece. Most of the time - the entire floor consists of one major art piece.\n\nThis is definitely a stop for any art lovers."
"1","A disappointing Amtrak station.\n\nWhat's really sad is that passenger rail has degraded so far in this country, especially in one of the areas where rail was once king.  Anyone who walks outside of the Amtrak station will witness Pittsburgh's Penn Station, a proud and magnificent facility that outlines how important passenger rail once was, with a vast rotunda to shelter vehicular traffic, and a majestic waiting area.  Unfortunately, all that has been converted to ... condos.\n\nNow, there's just a dumpy little room with some rows of seating and an Amtrak desk.  Given that only two Amtrak lines serve the station, each once daily, that's probably more sensible, but it is a sad commentary on how \""progress\"" often isn't."
"2","Not the friendliest customer service.  Prices okay.  Look for deals on their website."
"2","I have taken the train from Pittsburgh to Huntingdon, PA a few times. I have always had the best experiences. The train is clean and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and attentive. I would recommend the Amtrak train to anyone needing to travel long distance through public transit. \n\np.s. The free wifi and coffee from the cafe car make the trip even more enjoyable!"
"1","This Amtrak station is in need of a face lift! It is very dingy and outdated looking, which is surprising because it is underneath one of the most prestigious address in downtown Pittsburgh! \nThe employees were friendly and helpful, which was nice, and our train came on time which is really the most important thing!"
"1","This is a review for the AMTRAK CAPITOL LIMITED train route between Pittsburgh and Chicago.\n\nRiders beware. This is  a nightmare and a completely unreliable mode of transportation. Norfolk Southern owns these tracks. Unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays BOTH ways on this route for the past 2 to 3 months.  Freight cars get preference. 7 mile stretch in Indiana with only one track.  Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back. The staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control. Amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time. Terrible experience, I give it a F."
"1","This place was horrible. Did not, even for a moment, have a seat on the chairs while i waited to board the next train. The walls were dirty, nasty and dingy. It smelled awful inside. It was quite crowded. And I just did not like my surroundings.\n\nAnd dont let me get started on the restroom. after seeing the filth in here, i decided to walk down the street at 5am in the freezing cold to the greyhound station nearby to use their facilities.\n\nThere was absolutely no type of cafe or even little convenient store within this station to grab a bite to eat while you wait. I did find a vending machine to get coffee but even that was watered down. \n\nThis place needs to be torn down and rebuilt from the bottom up. I waited with my family down the street at a different station before we had to be back to board our train. \n\nI will be sure to not have this place in any of my future stops. Not a good way to sell the city...Horrible!\n\nThe only reason why i give this station 1 star is because the train itself was quite comfortable and clean."
"1","Unbelievably bad! If the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls have only cabbage in them. The \""chicken\"" is dark, fatty, and inedible. Don't miss the 100 pound tub of MSG as you walk in. I paid for my food ate half my egg roll noticed the roach, food was then delivered, I took one look at it and threw it out, and left. You should skip this place for sure."
"1","Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality."
"1","If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  \nThe food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG, but this place uses a bit much.  I got a whopping 2 pieces of wilted broccoli and 1 sliver of onion in my dish and the sauce ewww the sauce.  Not sure why I stepped into Fu Lai, probably because I wanted some cheap Chinese.  Never going back."
"1","I tried to give this place a chance despite it's reviews. It's not worth it. They were very quick (food ordered and delivered in under 25 minutes). The only thing is, my lo mein noodles were way overcooked and didn't have one vegetable in them. The noodles were very bland and almost chewy. My boyfriend's general tso's was less than subpar. The egg roll's didn't even have shrimp in them. Next time, I'll listen to the reviews."
"1","Worst Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice."
"1","The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad, weird taste and the food inevitably made us very sick afterwards. We ordered for pick up and they forgot our drinks and plastic ware. I will definitely never order from here again. Absolutely disgusting."
"2","A co-worker and I decided to go out to lunch together today.  As a contrast to the rather bland, rushed meal I ate yesterday at Subway, I suggested he and I try this place.  I'd read good things about it in the \""Post-Gazette\"" and the \""Tribune-Review\"".\n\nThe Rachel sandwich sounded mighty tempting, but since I was in the mood to sample, I tried the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo.  The soup was delicious and it sure didn't taste canned.  The 1/2 chicken sandwich on rye was very fresh too.  Good, inexpensive place to eat at.  They do catering too, so maybe I'll recommend them for the next office party."
"2","Stopped by Mark's for a quick bite to eat last night.  Both outside and in the place looks like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill bar, so I wasn't expecting anything special.  Then I saw that they had Dogfish Head and East End beers on tap - nice, I figured they'd just have macros.  I ordered a 60 minute IPA and a double-decker corned beef/pastrami Reuben.  The sandwich was amazing - fresh bread, lots of good meat, house-made dressing and slaw, and a heap of thick, flavorful, house-made chips.  It was easily the best sandwich I've had in Pittsburgh; admittedly this isn't saying much, but this sandwich would hold its own anywhere.  And at only $7 for a huge meal it's a great value, too.  I'll definitely be visiting Mark's again soon."
"2","I shop in the strip all the time.  I come to Stamoolis for a few things:  feta, stuffed grape leaves, and olives.  They have lots of Greek items, so if that's your thing, you should swing through.\n\nThey have something like 8+ different types of feta (French, Bulgerian, Greek, Greek Barrel, etc.) I didn't know there were that many different types until I came here.  The stuffed grape leaves are my bench mark for grape leaves.  Dilly, lemony, a bit sour, stuffed with rice...I love these things here.  I also get my olives for dirty martinis here...pick out your olives, get them weighed, and then fill up your container with brine and...voila! the best dirty martini brine you can find, for practically free.\n\nThey also have a relatively extensive cheese selection, albeit nothing as compared to Penn Mac.  It's definitely cheaper than Penn Mac though, so if you're looking for smaller quantities, or some more common cheeses, check here first."
"2","I went to the Strip to buy cheese for a few recipes I was going to try.  Since this was my first time buying cheese in the strip, I was planning on making my purchase at the more popular place next door.  However, I ended up buying everything from Stamoolis instead.  I like quality, but I also like a good price and I got both at Stamoolis.  It was nice to be able to get what I needed for a cheaper price than some other places.  I also love the bulk items here inlcuding the organic whole wheat coucous.\n\nMy only problem, even though it was minor for me was the the staff did not seem overly friendly or helpful."
"2","I stop here every time I am in the Strip.  Authentic Greek grocery.  Do not pass up their stuffed grape leaves or the freshly made Babaganous & hummus.  They have great cheeses and a variety of dried lentils and spices.  You will find something delicious here, I promise you that."
"1","Some of what they have is good, stuffed grape leaves,hummus and baklava, but beware, some items have been on the shelf too long. We discovered when we got home that two expensive cheeses were spoiled (no bree is not slimy & stinky nor is mozzarella.) We wasted $12 on spoiled food. Buyer beware. We are from out of town and cant return them. :( staff seemed distant and got the impression they did not want to be bothered. Stoic and unsmiling older guy was behind the counter. Hum, I'll be over here... grouch."
"1","Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!"
"1","They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.\n\nClearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!"
"1","DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that, they've lost my clothes before. And now I just got a $110 sweater back from being dry cleaned and the loop to hold the tassel on is ripping off. They are clearly incompetent. Not only that, the place smells like an ashtray when you walk in. How are your clothes even clean when they come from that? Awful."
"1","Not only did they damage a sweater, they told me they would take care of it with my tailor and never did.  On top of that, they write in PERMANENT MARKER on your clothes! Unbelievable! Stay away from this place.  Take the time and take your clothes somewhere else."
"1","I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but, after nearly having 3 shirts ruined I decided enough was enough. \n\nI think their delivery guy is a huge part of the problem, I actually like the owner, but I can't keep having my clothes messed up and not have anyone take responsibility for it. I wish I could tell people to go here but I can't do it in good conscience."
"2","i need you in los angeles. boo hoo. wah. sob. \n\nappreciate this place, pittsburghers. it rocks!!!\n\nthe cheese is of amazing quality and freshness. What fucking variety.\n\nAnd there are a million other tasty things under this roof. \n\nyou can't find a place like this easily, trust me, i have tried!"
"2","Penn Mac deserves more than 5 stars!\n\nThis place is the best italian food store I've seen anywhere in the US.  The selection and quality of their cheeses, meats, olives, pastas, oils, sauces, etc is just incredible.  The prices are also really good - any other store with a big cheese selection will charge a ton more.\n\nI used to shop here at least once a week and since I've moved away from Pittsburgh, this is the store I miss the most.  I now live in Chicago and even here there is nothing like it.  I still frequently buy their stuff online through their website....Thank God for the internet.\n\nFavorite items include: Calabrese Olives, House Italian Olive Oil, Istara Cheese, Mortadella w/Pistaccio, Ciabatta Bread"
"2","\""Hey, darling, you talkin' to your boyfriend?\""  the deli counter man recently teased me as I waited in line talking on my cell phone.  Oh the deli men - they're hilarious.  I'd even say, their worth the trip out to the store, but you might want to know more about the food, glorious food. \n\nI shop at the Macaroni Company weekly.  They're great.  From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.\n\nIn any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun."
"2","I love your wonderful cheese, Penn Mac!  You have an amazing variety, all my favorites."
"2","Outstanding place - a real asset for Pittsburgh.  They carry incredible food, but they don't carry the snobby attitudes (or high prices) that usually go along with good food.  Great cheese selection, and the guys at the counter know their stuff.  They're a little gruff, but they're actually really friendly guys.  (Please: don't hold a five minute conversation with them and try 10 cheeses on Saturday when there are 30 people waiting, though.)  The salamis across from the cheese counter are excellent, and this is probably the only place I've been that has 3-4 different brands of anchovy paste.  Their fresh pasta is excellent, too. \n\nOn the note of waiting: there's always a crowd here on Saturday, so grab your cheese number as soon as you get in the door, do the rest of your shopping, then head back to the cheese counter.  Better yet, go after around 3 on Saturday (or pretty much any other day of the week) to avoid the crowds.\n\n\n**P.S.  Don't go sampling 20 cheeses to make up your mind, but ask for a sample of any cheese before you buy it.  I just bought my second pound of \""past due\"" blue in a year.  (Two pounds out of probably 6-7 that I've bought in the past year.  And yes, I know most people would think that all blues are \""past due\"", but this stuff had the ammonia taste that's the telltale sign that the cheese has gone.)  Still love PennMac, but have a little caution."
"1","Have been a regular here for several years. They have a great selection of cheeses, sauces and pastas. They also have a small bread area and produce section. \n\nMost of the reviews online have been positive so I will share my negative. \n\n1. Be careful of the pasta selections. You can pay a high price for a bowl of noodles that tear apart as soon as they hit the water. Know what you are buying or leave it alone.\n\nI have always felt that the people behind the cheese counter were very knowledgeable. Anytime I was cooking a particular type of food or looking for a cheese that would go good with........I had only to ask. This past time I saw one of the regular employees and informed him that we were making mexican food for friends and I was looking for a cheese that would make a good queso.....but I was unable to finish. As soon as I said the work \""mexican\"" he glared at me and told me that although I may think he looks mexican - he wasn't.  He then left me standing at the counter while he went to get a drink of water. Maybe he was having a bad day - but he didn't improve mine any.  I bought my cheese down the street. Not sure I will go back, or at least I will try to get someone else to wait on me."
"2","I enjoy Italian food a lot, I've worked as a cook in a tuscan restaurant, and I happen to be Italian; therefore, I love Penn Mac Co..  I cannot find everything I need to cook a quality meal at any other single store.  Whether I'm making sauce from stewed tomatoes, perciatelli with anchovy, or salt-cod; this store never lets me down.  And despite the enormous traffic, the place is always clean and well stocked.  Any pasta shape you can think of can be found here dried and most you can find anywhere else can be found here fresh.  The fresh cheeses look great as do the olives, though to be honest I haven't bought any yet.  Well worth a visit while shopping the strip."
"2","Besides the fact that they have a phenomenal selection of meats & cheeses, they also have some of the most helpful, knowledgable staff around. I've come in on multiple occasions, not at all knowing what I wanted, but knowing I needed to make a cheese & meat platter for six. All I do is tell them that, & they start pulling cheeses & slicing off slivers for me to taste! They're just wonderful at Penn Mac.\n\nPS Try the English Gloucester cheese - it's a rich, orange, sorta cheddary cheese that's chock full of chives! Basically, the ideal cheese for potatoes."
"2","First impression upon entering the store (2/5) : \""What the heck is that smell?!\"" After walking into the store a little further, I found my answer. CHEESE! The store was a little on the \""sloppy/pack rat/ sweaty/ definitely wouldn't hurt to mop every once in a while\"" side. My first instinct wasn't to leave so that is always a good thing. \n\nCustomer service (5/5): I went there because my husband randomly missed Spain so he wanted to make a bunch of mini bocadillos with different types of meat and cheeses. We already got the meat from another place down the street so what better place to get a variety of cheeses than the Macaroni co? The lady that helped us was wonderful!! She was so patient with us even though there were a million people waiting in line.  She automatically knew which cheese to recommend based on what would compliment the meat that we had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the various kinds of cheese. I could seriously listen to her talk all day about the history of the cheese... she made it so interesting.  My husband is VERY indecisive so he couldn't figure out which one he liked more. \n\nFood (4/5): We tried at least 7 different kinds of cheese and I didn't like any of them... definitely not a cheese person. My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \""Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\"" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft. Totally grossed me out. Why would anyone think that is okay?!?! I can understand if you are squeezing the bread through the bag but don't TOUCH it! That is only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Oh and the fact that it wasn't that clean."
"1","The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!"
"2","The Penn Mac is a landmark in Pittsburgh.  I am a comlplete fan, in particular of their cheese section, which in many ways is the world's best.  They beat out the competition because of their excellent prices, selection, and their quality.  I have checked the prices at Whole Foods and Market District, and often times you pay twice as much at those places for the same cheese.  Carol, a.k.a. Dearheart, is a wonderful help, especially if you are there on a day when it's not as over crowded.  Some other great things about the store...bulk spices (very reasonably priced), olive oil, dried fruit, deli meats, and more.  This store is my favorite place in Pittsburgh and you are missing out if you have not visited!"
"2","My family and I have strong ties to Pittsburgh despite living in the Akron, Ohio area. Several times a year, however, we always make a point of visiting Pittsburgh, especially right before Christmas. Nothing spells Christmas quite like the Strip, and in particular, PennMac. The thought of the cheese/olive room is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I stocked up on jarred sauces, which are reasonably priced, generously portioned, and most importantly--fresh and delicious. We stacked loaves of bread in the car as well. Seeing all the salted fish (for the upcoming feast of 7 fishes) was beautiful. The most memorable part of the visit, however, was in a small, rather grimy room that boasted huge canisters of home-made wine and small glasses. Initially under the impression that I was intruding upon the staff holiday party, a smiling worker told me that customers were welcome to sample the wine. I was a little wary of trying the un-labeled wine, but it was wonderful and warming. While not available for sale, the wine tasting was a delightful way to warm up from the particularly vicious cold and mingle with other customers. Armed with an arsenal of goods to take back to Ohio, we returned home, satisfied and entirely in the Christmas spirit."
"2","A Pittsburgh version of DeBruno Brothers in Philadelphia, Zabars in NYC.  On entry, you are immediately hit with food smells.  They have everything for your charcuterie and pasta needs.  Cheeses, cured meats, breads, home made pasta.  I wanted everything there.  Don't go hungry (or do ;)  Very reasonable prices."
"2","Is absolutely my favorite place in Pittsburgh. The employees of Penn Mac are friendly, knowledgeable, and genuine. Its refreshing to see people enjoy where they work. The best selection of cheeses, deli meats, and spices Pittsburgh. In fact Penn Mac is so solid at these three things I am not sure who is a competitive second. Oh and they have a gigantic selection of pastas (including 15+ varieties of fresh cut pasta), sauces, and oils."
"2","I love it here :)  I love all the employees and the owners also!  I miss Penn Mac now that I live in Hawaii but I will visit every time I am in Pittsburgh!"
"2","The best.\n\nThe cheese counter is heaven on earth.  The workers are awesome - who doesn't want to be called \""dear heart\"" while tasting delicious cheeses?  They're super helpful with my weird requests to find the perfect cheeses for every occasion.  I always walk out with new varieties and grab tons of nuts and sauces and oils on my way to the register.\n\nWe also had our engagement pictures taken here (does that show my level of obsession?).  We called in advance and the managers were all very kind - they told us to stop by their office and say, \""Hello\"" even.  It was so much fun!  \n\nMy mom also carted several cheeses down to North Carolina to be served as appetizers for my wedding as well.  Seriously obsessed. \n\nI love Penn Mac."
"2","This is Italian heaven.  It has everything the Italian Pittsburgher could want.  I've since moved away from Pittsburgh but recently was sent some Penn Mac merchandise and it was a dream!  They package everything so well and ship it quickly!  I couldn't have asked for a better and tastier gift.  The store is perfection, but you already know that from other reviewers :)"
"2","I saw Franco Harris at this place he was a class act great place to by real food from Italy"
"2","Nothing better then the strip district in Pittsburgh. It's every Italians dream. The PMC is the best has a little bit of everything. Fresh bread great pasta and Olive for days. I love it here and the smell is terrific :)"
"2","Pittsburgh Bound!  Part VIII\n\nI moved to Atlanta in December of last year from Pittsburgh and had yet to be back.  Virtually every Labor Day weekend of my entire life was spent in Pittsburgh with my parents, as my birthday falls within the window.  I promised my folks that I would make a long weekend out of it, and head on home.  The following reviews are a step-by-step account of the long weekend.  Enjoy!\n\n(For Part VII, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/hsRjct8UiUHU54B983GmcA/review/5q1GTAV1pUIq_BgCnNNY-A?fsid=oxxZiKVdfoPZvy9nBFr2AQ)\n\nPenn Mac, as it's locally known boasts the best Italian grocery store outside of Italy.  Established in the 1940's, Penn Mac is famous for their cheese selection with hundreds of choices.  I always leave with a small tub of their fresh mozzarella which is made daily and goes perfect with a little basil and cherry tomatoes.  The employees working the cheese counter have all been there for years and are very knowledgeable.  If you're lucky, you'll hear Carol affectionately refer to each customer as \""Dearheart\"" as she offers up suggestions and samples to ensure that the customer gets exactly what they're looking for.\n\nThe balsamic and olive oil selections are just as impressive as are the fresh pastas, local breads, olives, and Italian cured meats.  I can't remember a time I've gone to Penn Mac without buying something that I had no intention of going home with.  On this trip, I picked up a few pastas that I can't find at home as well as an aged balsamic that I hope makes its way back to Atlanta without exploding in my luggage. \n\nIf you need any off-the-wall Italian ingredient that you can't find anywhere, I guarantee that Penn Mac not only regularly carries it, but probably has 12 different varieties to choose from.\n\n(For Part IX, go to: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/EnJS6OeeknzOjVUX6RYwlQ/review/8hA8rRHss2PRlroWujzT_Q?fsid=D3ZAe8-bG1Zz-raxtTTr8Q)"
"2","I love this place!  They have everything and bc I currently am working in the Strip Dist I love being able to walk in there and pick up stuff for dinner on my way home.\n\nI would never, ever come here on the weekend bc I love myself far too much for that.\n\nThis place is always packed.  I like the cheese area but I never know what to get and so I've never bought cheese here.  But they have fresh pasta you can buy in the front of the house, and they've got great specialty items."
"1","Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service, however today was the exception. Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now. A simple yes or no would have been nice. I said ok thanks anyway. Then she must have reconsidered and said well did you want something??? In a very rude voice. Needless to say I walked away. Wow! Pennsylvania Macaroni Company needs to work on customer service. Obviously she hates her job, then get another one! If I didn't drive so far to get there I wouldn't have written this review. Every January I buy 3 months worth of cheese for my family members. I won't be doing that anymore."
"2","How did I not realize that the Harris is cash only?"
"2","I like little indie theaters like this.  (WARNING: If you want big comfy seats, digital projection, surround sound, and a bucket o' soda, head elsewhere!)  It's small, shows art/foreign/indie films, and you can get a ginger ale for $1.50.  My ticket was only $4 since I'm a grad student...you can't beat that, and there are some amazing movies that show here!  My husband complained the whole time that the seats were uncomfortable, but I was fine.\n\nI am glad that we have the Harris downtown, and I will most likely return."
"2","I saw 'Blackbird' starring Mo'Nique, Isaiah Washington and Julian Walker at the Harris Theatre.  With a recently renovated sound system, there WAS a huge interruption during the viewing of the film with what sounded like a BLOWN out speaker (happened 3 times) that sent chills (bad ones) through the body of the audience.  \n\nNot my first time at the theatre, the lobby is quite small, but provides the iconic popcorn smell (and freshly popped) upon entry.  A great spot with beautiful lighting to draw in the general public, I am sure many are deterred by the trip downtown because of the \""parking\"" situation.  Well, folks you are missing out.  I will be back!"
"2","Our in-laws suggested Dr. Battle and company when our dog, Levi, suddenly got ill.  The staff was very kind and caring even when the diagnosis was not positive.  They gave us as much time as we needed to stay with Levi and were sympathetic."
"2","Hands down the best Gyros in Pittsburgh! There are four types of gyros to choose from: Lamb & beef, chicken, steak and vegetarian.\n\nThere are long lines at lunch time but, they move quick. Seating is hard to come by as well. You best bet is to get it to go.\n\nThey offer all types of different things like burgers, wings, shrimp, salads, tuna melts, steak hoagies and much more.\n\nThey offer Daily Specials as well.\n\nMonday  - Free Fries with any sandwich\nTuesday  - Chicken Gyro with fries\nWednesday  - Shish Ka Bob Salad\nThursday  - Gyro and fries\nFriday  - Fish Sandwich and fries\n\nThe only things that I don't like is that they close at 3pm daily and they're not open on the weekend.\n\nIf God made gyros this is what they would taste like!"
"2","Great place for lunch!\n\nThe reviews on yelp don't do this place justice.  The food coming out of the kitchen looked great --- especially the gyro's and french fries.\n\nI opted for the Quad-S (my term not theirs) Summer Sensation Salad with Salmon.  Big salad, not skimping on the ingredients, and nice piece of fish on top.\n\nI'll definitely be back. (once I finish my tour of lunch spots in Pittsburgh, I'm on about #45 without repeating)\n\nPlenty of seating, and they move you through quick despite the lines...."
"1","so, i go in and order a gyro (yee-ro - you know, how you're supposed to say it).  the server goes you mean a 'jai-ro?!' (as in gyroscope), in a very loud kind of condescending voice.  i said, no, i mean a 'yee-ro'.  as if she didn't know what i was talking about anyway!\n\nwith the greek authenticity of the place seriously in question, i should've walked away then, but i was really hungry and didn't have a lot of time for lunch.  it was just average, nothing special.  again, i've been spoiled by NYC.  besides, i think it's a good policy to not eat where they can't properly pronounce what they're serving."
"1","I decided to try this place after reading on Yelp how good it is.  This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.   The gyro sandwich for $5 was OK at best.  They threw some tomatoes on it. The sauce could be better.  The fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  \n\nThey charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  \n\nTables were not very clean.  I was surprised at the number of patrons.  This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials, but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food.  They get a C from me."
"2","I always enjoy coming here for lunch.\n\nI love that Zorba's has specials everyday- I usually come on Thursdays for the Gyro Special. The gyro is good and they are very, very generous on the yummy fresh cut fries. \n\nI've also had the buffalo chicken salad and it's piled high. The handbreaded fish is huuuuge.(way larger than the roll that it's on) and handbreaded.. so winner winner, fish dinner (or lunch!)\n\nIf I were rating Zorba's homemade ranch, it'd be an easy 5 stars. sometimes I pack my lunch (a quick sandwhich and some crackers) then head over to Zorba's just for some fries and ranch, hahaha!"
"2","This coffeeshop is a winner.\n\nThey have deli foods, which always have a happy line, but I've never managed to try them.  I made a beeline for the back of the shop, where they probably have fifty varieties of coffee beans, and at least as many varieties of tea.  Behind the coffee, in a glass-walled room, is the roaster, this enormous machine that lets them roast the beans fresh, all the time, in the store.\n\nBehind the counter is an older guy named John Prestogeorge.  When I asked him for a recommendation, he suggested the J.P. Hearty blend on their coffee list, which is a blend he started selling in the 1960's.  He's still there.  It's still good.  Lately, I've moved to the organic sumatran, and really want to try the kona; I'm confident they'll be around for awhile, and I'll be headed back."
"2","The perfectly balanced cappuccino -- skim milk, extra shot --warmed the cockles of my heart.\n\n$9.49 for an aromatic pound of Italian Blend espresso beans lovingly roasted on premise had my wallet  -- and then our espresso machine -- singing \""O Sole Mio.\""\n\nNattily dressed coffologists -- sporting plaid button-fronts and page-boy caps -- ignited the same butterflies that drove my obsession with \""Newsies\"" in middle school.\n\nSo many reasons to love this little independent wonder."
"2","Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got cheese in my tummy.\n\nThis place is very compact.  I felt a bit overwhelmed. There is just so much to look at.  On my visit to PFF I got a 16oz cappuccino and a grilled cheese with bacon. \nMaybe you are asking yourself how awesome can a grilled cheese sandwich really be please read on.\n\nThe cheese on my sandwich was melted all the way through no cold center to be found here.  The bacon was perfectly crisp too.  I was a little concerned about this because from across the deli counter I didn't see any real cook station.  It looks as if they are back there working with a microwave and a toaster oven.  But really I had nothing to worry about because the sandwich came out perfect.  There is some real magic happening behind that counter.  I seriously doubt I could ever hope to replicate that grilled cheese at home with my toaster oven...maybe it's industrial grade?\n\nBonus,  they served it with a little pickle.  \n\nThe cappuccino was also very good. The foam was knuckle deep. Now that's something you're not going to get a Dunkin Doughnuts. \n\nPrestogeorge makes food...but there is only one table inside that could probably seat about 4 people comfortably.  You might want to be mindful of that in case you're looking to dine in.  I was able to snag the table with it being 7 degrees outside...it wasn't too busy and it was Wednesday too.\n\nMy only hang up is that the 16oz drink is the smallest drink size.  I ended up wasting about 1/3rd of my beverage."
"2","We rotate our coffee purchases between here and La Prima.  It's a tad overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for, but the staff is ready and willing to help direct you to a coffee bean that is perfect for your taste.  We've tried many different varieties of the dark blends, and all are delicious.  I highly recommend giving this place a try!"
"2","This place rocks! The coffee selection is out of this world and the coffee itself is wonderful! It is smooth and just terrific!"
"2","My family has been going to the Strip and shopping at Prestogeorge for years. When I moved to the DC area I couldn't find any coffee as good as Prestogeorge's. Luckily, you can order online and have it shipped to your house. Every time I order it comes to my door the next day. This is such a plus for me since I always wait until the last minute to order coffee when I'm running low. You can order whole beans or have them ground to your specific coffee pot/french press. My favorite flavor of coffee is coconut cream. My only complaint is that they don't send you a receipt via email or shipping confirmation. But really, who needs an email when it comes the next day with a printed receipt in the box? Please give this place a try if you're looking for the best and freshest coffee around!"
"2","They have an extensive assortment of coffee beans and a friendly, quick staff. I wound up getting their Sumatra beans and loved them."
"2","This is, by far, one of my favorite places in the Strip District! My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed!"
"2","Since recently taking a more serious interest in brewing my own coffee, I am willing to go in search of a better bean.  Prestogeorge is top of my list.  \n\nI always marvel at their selection of coffees, the different types of beans and roasts.  The wall off coffee can be intimidating, but the staff is knowledgeable and helpful without being pretentious.  I started off with the JP Hearty Blend and was not disappointed.  I've since purchased other blends including the Italian espresso (which I used to make some delicious chocolate covered espresso beans) and the Vienna Roast (which I use for cold brewing).  Loose leaf tea is also available as well as brewing supplies.  If flavored coffee is more your thing, it is definitely not in short supply here.  Prestogeorge also serves beverages and some food items but I have never tried anything prepared there.  \n\nThe cost of their coffee and supplies is more than reasonable when compared to national brands available in local grocery stores.  And for coffee roasted on site where you can watch the process, you can't beat it."
"2","The atmosphere and service from this restaurant were a welcome change from much of what we received the rest of our stay in Pittsburgh. The staff seemed genuinely friendly and attentive. \n\nThe food was good- not outstanding but definitely one of the best meals I had in the city. I ordered salmon, which was cooked perfectly. My friends had the pasta tasting, which for it's price seemed very reasonable. Pasta dishes never impress me the way other dishes do, but teh three offered this night were on the lighter side and a nice variety.\n\nOh why lie, they each had three servings and I was eating off their plates. That food was gooood!"
"1","I really want to give this place a good review, the decor is beautiful, the wine list is great (about ten $28 bottles, red and white, the pino grigio we had was phenom!), the service was fine, but the food was totally forgettable.\n\nThe service.... You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \""that kind\"" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience. My very small office was saying goodbye to one of our coworkers, so we went to Lidia's for a boozy lunch. We were in high spirits and having a great time. The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table. Anyway, I didn't knock off a star for this, it doesn't seem important enough. But it did taint my visit. I remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food.\n\nOh, and don't bother with the tiramisu, it's all cream, almost no cake.\n\nBut the atmosphere is great, they really went all out with the interior design. The menu isn't particularly veg friendly, but it's not too bad. Lidia's does high-end traditional Italian without being too pretentious or too predictable. But I have no desire to eat what I ordered (the daily special pasta trio) again nor do I have any interest in trying anything else on the menu. Months later I decided to lower my stars from four to two. I really wanted to like this place, but I really didn't.\n\nAnd I gotta talk about that wine list again, it's Lidia's only shining star. Of course, they have a pricey reserve list, but they have a whole bunch of really cheap, good bottles, and a bunch of wines by the glass too."
"2","I really enjoyed my experience at Lidia's.  My friend and I were seated promptly, and we shared an order of the crab fricos, which were quite good.  For my main course, I had a calamari dish with large beans.  I can't remember the name of it, and it's not on the menu online, so ... but all I can say is that my mouth started salivating as I was writing this, so you know it was good.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, which was incredibly rich.  I don't think we finished it, but it was good.\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant experience.  Would love to go again."
"2","Somehow I thought the place was going to be fancier.  The way the concierge at the hotel spoke of it, it sounded like it was going to be expensive and busy.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see entrees that weren't too expensive and a very comfortable atmosphere!  It was a welcome warm spot on a cold November night!\n\nI had the Pasta 3-course meal and was thrilled! - cesaer salad, all-u-can-eat 3 types of pastas and any dessert off of the dessert menu!  I thoroughly enjoyed 2 of the 3 pastas and particularly liked the meat raviolis.  Very tasty!  While it was an all-u-can-eat offer, we really didn't have much more than small amounts of each, as all the portions were hearty and filling.\n\nThe wine list had a selection of $28 bottles that were not fantastic, but tasty for the price.  And the ambiance was enjoyable.  Our group of 8 had pretty good service, and definitely enjoyed our experience there.\n\nSide note:  Not an Italian dish, but the night we were there one of their specials was Hungarian Goolash, that was raved about by the 1 person at our table who ordered it!"
"2","First time at Lidia's, although I've wanted to go there every time I'm in Pittsburgh.\n\nI got the prix fixe Lidia's Trio del Giorno.  Started off with a great Caesar's salad (Insalata \""Cesare\"" alla Lidia), followed by three pasta dishes, and ended with an interesting choice for dessert.  \n\nThe pastas were right out of the kitchen - the farfalle with fennel, caramelized onions, sausage, and some tomatoes, was fantastic.  The gnocchi were great, and the linguine with basil pasta and shrimp was good but not on par with the other two pastas.  \n\nThe dessert was an olive oil and basil torte with lemon ice cream (my description doesn't adequately describe it) - I should've written down the description from the menu, although I did upload a photo of the dessert.\n\nThe wait staff was outstanding - attentive without being intrusive.  The decor is awesome - especially the backlit wall with wine bottles.  \n\nI hope to be in Pittsburgh again very soon and will definitely go back to Lidia's."
"1","If you like the Olive Garden, you'll LOVE Lidia's!  \n\nWe were a party of two on a Sunday night -- the restaurant was moderately busy.  Our server was a bit of a space cadet.  We had to stop another waiter to ask for more water...I was never offered a refill on my diet coke (which sat empty for over 30 minutes).\n\nThe salmon was very good, but drenched in so much olive oil and garlic that an oil slick was left on the plate at the end of the meal.  The pasta tasting was....kind of weird.  One of the selections tasted like feet, the other tasted like something I could make at home with a bottle of Prego.  The best was a mushroom ravioli in olive oil -- but there was so much oil (see a theme?) I had to scrape it off before eating.\n\nLong story short, we passed on dessert.   The food was adequate, the service was sub-par, and it was just kind of a \""meh\"" experience.\n\nI won't go back."
"1","Lidia's is an upscale Olive Garden with slightly better wine list.\n\nThe biggest problem?  Everything is bland. They have a salt problem. They must not have it in their kitchen. Everything needed it.\n\nThe salads were the only fairly good items we had. The arugula salad with pear walnuts and Gorgonzola was well dressed, but the beets were not cooked to their sweet level. \n\nThe lamb chops were awful. Lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb.  I sent it back. They replaced it with pork tenderloin served on a tomato sauce (needed salt) and with cheese melted over the top with asparagus and a slice of Roma tomato. It was a sad sad dish. The tomato was hard as rock. The tenderloin was over cooked.  Just bad.\n\nI had the chicken piccata upon the recommendation of the server. It had lemon, capers and green olives. The vinegar fought with the lemon in the most vile way. The chicken had that flour coated slime feel in the mouth. Served on a bed of spinach. That was the only decent taste on the plate if it didn't have any of the sauce on it. \n\nBread is awful. They have a foccacia and skinny bread sticks that tasted stale to me. Served with an olive spread and a garlic white bean spread. They were fine on their own - in fact rather tasty.\n\nThe menu is really odd. Just in the way it is laid out and with the choices. Two west coast fish selections. Halibut and salmon.  Coming from the west coast, I just overlooked them by a matter of principle. \n\nBut the worse is the pasta trio. The concept is just so olive garden. All you can eat of three different pastas served table side. They cart a saut\u00e9 pan to your table. What is that all about? Our neighbors ordered it and I over heard them talking to their server about their disappointment.\n\nBut like all things Pittsburgh the people were so nice. They were gracious about the lamb and took it and the pork replacement off the bill. \n\nI just have to wonder why Lidia would create a menu like this. It just doesn't match her books or shows at all. It does nothing to support the brand of Lidia. Unless she is really trying to take over the Olive Garden market."
"2","My dearest Lidia,\n\nHello! How are you? How's Manhattan? Is PBS treating you well? Is your wallet getting fatter by the second? I hope so. \n\nI finally dropped by your restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District this evening. I know you've been begging me to check it out for years, but quite frankly, I just haven't been in the mood for pasta. You know how I am... carbs and all. \n\nYou know, I must give you props for the restaurant's layout. The fancy wall art, the color of the paint... I must say Rockwell did a very good job, and watching the sun set over the Allegheny River while dining on our meal was simply delightful. \n\nAt the behest of our server, each of my dining companions and I ordered the prix fixe pasta and a few antipasti. The antipasti were lovely - the lightly seasoned calamari was divine and the fresh mozzarella and olive platter was splendid. A terrific way to start the meal.\n\nNow Lidia, I know you'll never indulge me, but what on earth is in the dressing on your Caesar salad? It's smashing! There's definitely a hint of pear in it, but other than that, I'm flummoxed. Oh, and the imported cheese really bolstered the salad, sending a usually ho-hum affair into the stratosphere. You've really outdone yourself, my dear. \n\nAnd then came the prix fixe pasta trio. Lidia, darling, you know I'm a fan, but it really wasn't your best effort. The imported eggplant was overpowered by the tomato sauce, and the broccoli and sausage rabe was good but not great. Only the goat cheese-stuffed ravioli was better than average, but just marginally. Our server informed us that the ravioli was infused with thyme, but spank my bottom if I didn't taste a thing! Over all, not your best showing. \n\nDessert was quite sterling - the strawberry panna cotta was perfectly prepared, although a bit much with the cookies. Really, who has room for all that. I know you chide me constantly with your incessant \""mangia, Joe, mangia!\"", but I had really eaten far too much and the champagne had gone to my head as well. \n\nSo there you have it: my visit to your restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not quite five stars, but certainly not 3 stars. I'll give you a four this time, if only for the blandness of the prix fixe. Do give my love to Joseph and don't be a stranger. We haven't chatted on Skype in ages!\n\nKisses,\nJoe"
"1","When the bookends of your meal are the only strong points then you aren't going to score strongly in my book.  The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.  \n\nAs for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.  \n\nI ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish.  Let the fish do the talking.  There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish.  The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar.\n\nThe desserts were very good however.  We went with the Tiramisu and \nSemifreddo di Cioccolato e Caramello (Milk Chocolate and carmel ice creams, chocolate cake, toasted meringue, crushed toffee).  \n\nThe decor was definitely cool inside too.  Maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna?\n\nLidia's, the trying too hard, portion controlled spot in Pittsburgh."
"1","During a recent roadtrip to Pittsburgh our party of three found ourselves tired and ready for something delicious for dinner with the caveat that it had to be walking distance from our hotel. We consulted Yelp and decided to try out Lidia's for dinner. \n\nThe place is located on the fringes of the Strip and has nice clean feel to it. That's about as good as things got for me personally. The service was not very good. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes although the dining room was almost empty. A bread basket was placed on the table, but the bread was not very good. Once our waiter did come, (he looked like a Mafia Don) it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. \nI ordered the grilled octopus on a bed of potatoes and an heirloom tomato salad, both appetizers, as my meal. The tomatoes were not ripe and unfortunately did not have enough acid of any kind on them so that flavor was quite bland. There was no salt or pepper on the table, and no pepper was offered either. The octopus was bland but quite tender and fresh.\n\nMy husband ordered the salmon which he thought was good but a bit overcooked overall -- nothing to write home about. \n\nThe third person in our party ordered the pork porter house which was very tasty.\n\nBased on fellow Yelpers we ordered the strawberry pannacotta for desert but unfortunately they had none at 7:30! We settled for cookies and a tiramisu. We left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food."
"2","We went to treat A's parents for their anniversary - his mom has been obsessed with this lady forever. I had an amazing lobster risotto, A had the osso bucco, and his mom tried the pasta trio, which was divine. His dad had something spicy and in marinara sauce...looked godd. Neat atmosphere, and knowledgeable waitstaff..."
"2","I'm not a big Italian fan, but since we are up north where the best Italian is, I wanted to try it. Breads were served with strawberry, apricot, and crunchy sugar butter. That was great. We were in for brunch on Sunday. I had the Filet and was not super impressed with the meat, but the potato wedges were quite tasty. Then dessert, I loved most, but the almond/hazelnut cristota was to die for. Hubby had Pasta Trio and was satisfied. Would go back."
"2","Good food and beautiful space. My family and I were here the other night. We had gnocchi with duck; lamb chops; the fish of the day; grilled salmon and the pasta trio.\nThe gnocchi with the duck was outstanding. The other entrees were very good. The pasta trio last night was slightly disappointing. Ravioli, Papardelle and Penne a la Vodka-lacked something. Overall, a nice meal. I would go back."
"1","Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own Italian cooking show? Should be great, right? Not so much.\n\nWent here recently and ordered the pasta trio, since this is apparently what one gets at Lidias. Perhaps I went on the wrong day, but I thought that the three pastas (bolognese sauce, pesto sauce, and gnocchi with sage butter) were underwhelming. At the very least, there are Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh that offer much better food for a similar price.\n\nThe one positive to Lidia's was the dessert - which was fantastic. I had a bite of a chocolate torte, and was very impressed. The coffee with grappa was also quite nice.\n\nAll things told, though, I would spend my money elsewhere."
"2","If you're new to the steel city, and want consistently superb modern Italian, this is your place.  The menu has standards you grew up loving, as well as modern dishes and new twists on classic gems!  The staff is attentive and informative without being overbearing; the wine list is extensive, and the well drinks are stiff..."
"1","I went here on a crowded saturday night with a large party (8 people at our table.) I ordered the spicy calamari. It was not spicy. It was overcooked, like rubber, and served on plain white beans. Yuck. I won't go back. My boyfriend had the seafood dish. Most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless."
"2","My coworker had been recommending Lidia's to me for a while, and I'm glad I listened to her and brought my family here for dinner last week.  We had a wonderful Italian meal, and one of the better dining experiences in Pittsburgh so far.\n\nWe had a reservation on Saturday night around 6 pm, and used their valet service ($5?  $6?  I forget).  We were seated right away, and we all admired the gorgeous dining room space.  It seems to have been built in an old warehouse - the ceiling is massively high, and there's gorgeous Mondrian-esque glass over the bar.  Very stylish!  \n\nI should also say right off the bat that our server was outstanding.  Friendly, funny, and knowledgeable, he was one of the best parts of the whole experience.  He helped us choose a wine which we all enjoyed, and he poured it skillfully.  He was also helpful to us at various points throughout the meal - for example, four of us began with the Insalata di Rucola (split two salads between four people, and they came on separate plates).  The salad sounded amazing, with arugula, pear, walnuts, and gorgonzola (get in mah belleh) but we all noticed that there was quite a lack of...well, pear.  We all had maybe one measly little wedge, and it definitely kept the salad from being as yummy as it should have been.  So we told our server about it, and he immediately brought out a plate full of pear slices.  Redeemed!  And the salad became delicious.\n\nMy entree was the Ravioli di Cinghale (ravioli filled with wild boar, in a rosemary sauce) and it was pretty delicious.  Three big raviolis, filled with succulent meat (think pulled pork, but Italian and well-spiced).  The sauce was very very light, but still flavorful.  My dad got the Pasta Trio, and it was hilariously awesome to watch three different guys come by with big bowls, delivering their delicious wares to his plate.  He had a lot of fun with that.  My mom loved her sea bass as well.  \n\nDad's pasta trio came with a dessert, so he got the Crostata di Pere, a sugary pear maple dessert which I think was good, but I don't have really strong memories of it so clearly it didn't bowl me over.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good meal with some truly excellent service.  We felt cared for and comfortable, and our bellies were full.  What more could we ask for?"
"1","I was very disappointed with my meal here. I expected way more from Lidia's. As a regular viewer of the show I was expecting fresh / rustic Italian meals. What I ended up with was stuffed pasta that I'm 95% sure was reheated in a microwave, bland mains, and slow and inattentive service. The only highlight of the meal was the bread which was the only fresh ingredient used in the entire meal."
"1","WAAAAY over priced and although their appetizers were good, I'm not sure if it's bc we went in August and the kitchen was hot and the cooks were sweating their butts off back there but they salted their pastas WAAAAY too much. One of the pastas in their trio had sun dried tomatoes and capers in it. You'd think they'd tone down the saltiness of the pasta to let the saltiness of the sundries tomatoes and capers pull it together but no. I felt like I was eating strands of salt.  The ambiance is great and their wine menu is extensive. Maybe it was a bad day but I think I can find better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh with it's strong Italian roots."
"1","I was really looking forward to Lidia's.  And was really disappointed.  \n\nBread was good. The cocktails were good.  The service was attentive and friendly (just don't get between a server dishing out the unlimited pasta and a hungry customer who clearly hadn't reached their limit with the unlimited servings).  \n\nToo bad the food wasn't good.  The beet salad was underwhelming.  I had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  I felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  I suspect such positive memories are no longer :(\n\nMy other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  Another disappointment.   \n\nAnd thus my rating of Meh. Which is a huge shame.  But life goes on..."
"2","Very good.  Great atmosphere for a date or special occasion.  The Pasta trio is always great.  On Sunday they offer family style for $25(Salad, Entree, Dessert).  \n\nGrilled Octopus, Lasagna, salads are very good.  Will be going back soon."
"2","Overall experience was rather good. This is an impressive review for me to give a restaurant as I consider myself an avid foodie. It is rare for me to give an Italian restaurant a rave review, since I grew up eating Italian-American homemade meals. \n\nThe ambiance was nice, the buzz was slightly nosier than I would have liked but it was also not so much so to be considered bothersome. Their staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I will say, it was a little strange to not receive a menu until after we were served water and bread sticks. I can actually say I've never been seated at a restaurant where it took 15 minutes to receive one. However, after munching on the delightful breadbasket (The star of which is definitely the Focaccia bread) left me excited for what was yet to come. \n\nI enjoyed the affordable wine selection. We order an Italian table wine style Pinot Noir. It was delightful and we would order it again.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the Capesante: grilled sea scallops, shaved fennel, red onion, orange and basil. My husband and I rarely go out to eat without ordering some sort of scallop dish.  I can proudly say, their scallops had a lovely sear and were cooked perfectly inside. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Lidia's Pasta Trio which is their signature dish.  Unlimited daily pasta selection served table-side. I must confess, I found the serving via table-side a little odd. If they served only my portion from the pan it would not have been as off. But thinking that others may have or will be served from that same dish that is inches away from the diner was a bit off. I had the linguine w/ walnut pesto which was average nothing too spectacular but good all around. The chicken, pork ravioli was interesting. Tastier that I expected. In fact, had I not tried my husband's entree I would have been more impressed with my ravioli. Lastly, it was served w/ eggplant penne in a red sauce. I was probably least underwhelmed by this last dish. But nevertheless, all three pastas far supersede the majority of Pittsburgh Italian restaurants. \n\nI order this with the Caesar salad and choice of dessert. The salad was okay. Admittedly, I'm a hard sell with Caesar as I prefer to make it myself. Unless of course I am eating it from Emeril's (Las Vegas) which was the best Caesar I've ever eaten. Bygones.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Torta d'Ananas- ricotta and butter cake, caramelized pineapple, Amarena cherries, and coconut ice cream. If I had to guess, the cherries were present in syrup form perhaps on the top of the cake. As I did not see any cherries (or taste for that matter) their presence within the dish. Perhaps the syrup was used sparingly. Nevertheless, the dish was yummy. The coconut ice cream with the caramelized pineapple was the star. However, I do not think it was spectacular enough to order again.\n\nMy husband had the Ravioli di Cinghale: ravioli filled with braised wild boar in a rosemary infused sauce. This dish was amazing. I could not believe how delicious every single aspect of this dish was. The ravioli looked so fresh, it appear made to order. Significantly, far exceeded the quality present in the Trio I ordered. The rosemary infused sauce was one of the most incredible sauces I have EVER eaten. The wild boar itself, was absolutely to die for. My husband and I swore we would be back, simply for us both to eat this dish again. It is a MUST HAVE. Enjoy!"
"2","Went here for brunch yesterday. \n\nWhat we sampled: \nMimosa (I don't like mimosas, but this was delicious with fresh squeezed orange juice)\nBread basket (sea salt foccacia (delicious) cranberry and almond scones (delicious, but very crumbly which the fiance found out the hard way) strawberry butter, sugar butter, and honey butter)\nAntipasta table (overall good selection, but a little bland, the only memorable thing on the table for us was the Cesar salad, which was delicious, but a tad overdressed) \nEntree (we both ordered the pasta trio.  The three choices were penne with onions, sausage, and tomato ragu (the least favorite), Homemae fettucine aglio e olio with tomatoes and butternut squash (delicious and very fresh tasting for the fall), and homemade mushroom ravioli in a thyme butter sauce (the best selection by far and completely delicious)\nDessert table (good selections with standouts being the tiramisu and the chocolate torte)\n\nOverall this was a great brunch experience for the price as well as the selections.  We would definitely return."
"1","This place had horrible service. I waited (sitting at the bar non-the-less) for about 10 minutes before the loser bartender got me a drink and a menu. The food was weak, I got a Caesar salad and the wild bore stuffed ravioli. I was horrible. It was like they took some pulled pork and just stuffed a spoonful in a ravioli. I will not return, too many other better restaurants are in town to waste your time on this one."
"2","We were at Lidia's for an early dinner before seeing a show.  They have a great wine list and our server made some excellent suggestions.  The food was wonderful.  Several of us had the Pasta Trio.  This is a sampler dish with three different pastas prepared and served at your table.  Afterwards, you can get additional servings of your favorite from the Trio.  Of course, none of us even had room for an additional serving.  If you get the Trio, I'd recommend getting the option that includes the salad and dessert.  It's a great deal and you know you'll want it anyway!"
"2","I had a great lunch here!\n\nThe service, TBH, was average, but they pre-bused the hell out of my table so I was incredibly delighted!\n(Lack of pre-bus is a HUUUUUGE pet peeve of mine!)\n\nThere were several items on the menu that I really wanted to try and I was truly torn on what to get.\nThere was a Wild Boar dish, a Salmon that sounded amazing, and a Duck dish that sounded awesome, too!\n\nI'll walk you through the meal...\n\n1.)  They bring you some delicious breads (a Rosemary and Sea Salt bread, and another plainer Italian bread) to dip into a plate that had 2 perfectly rounded scoops of spreads in a pool of olive oil.\nThe scoops?  I think that one was an avocado-based spread and the other, I think, was a black bean spread--neither of them were overly flavorful, but both were relatively light and fresh.\n**My Faves Here:  Sea Salt & Rosemary Bread with the [Black Bean] Spread\n\n2.)  Next was salad: You can choose a Caesar salad or a pickier/plane salad (but the plane salad will take extra time to make because the servers prep the salads themselves--so it was explained to us, anyhow).\nThe Caesar was good!  The anchovies are diced into the dressing, but you can barely recognize them if you're not a fan of anchovies and are worried about that.\nI honestly wouldn't have even known they were in there, had I not asked!\n**My Faves Here: Go for the Ceasar; it was great!\n\n3.)  For an appetizer (this is a weird choice, but I'm happy we did it), we got the \""Chef's Vegetarian Sampler\"".  This included a delicious, and lightly spicy, Barley Risotto, some Sauteed Spinach, and some type of [fried] Potato dish.  It was very good!\n**My Faves Here:  The Potatoes were pretty addicting!\n**Least Faves Here:  The sauteed spinach--very garlicy!\n\n4.)  I ended up choosing \""Lidia's Pasta Tasting Trio\""--and I would recommend that to others who find themselves torn between several things.\nHere's how this works...\nThere are 3 pastas \""of the day\"".\nThe servers bring around large bowls of all three types of pasta and places all three types on your plate for you to try.\nOne you've sampled all three, its \""all you can eat\"" of your faves.\nThey'll ask you what types you'd like more of and give you more.\nNot a bad deal!\n\nThe day that I went, all three were pretty good.\nOne had a spicy, red sauce and wide noodles.\nAnother had an olive oil based sauce and had Orecchiette pasta.\nThe last one was the one that I could have eaten allllllll day!\nIt was simple, but amazing!\nGoat Cheese filled Ravioli with a Butter and Thyme sauce!  Ugh... to die for!\n\nLet me tell you about this ravioli!\nThey were not \""doughey\"" at all; they were perfect!\nVery thin pasta, but none were broken!\nDelicate and perfectly filled with the most amazing cheese.\nThe butter/thyme sauce wasn't the least bit overwhelming!\nIt was the perfect compliment to this dish!\n...just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Lidia's NOW!\n**My Faves Here:  OBVIOUSLY the Goat Cheese Ravioli!\n**My Least Fave:  The Orcchiette dish.  It wasn't \""bad\"", it was just \""meh\"".\n\n5.)  Oh, yes... there WAS dessert, too!  ;)\n(don't judge me!  lots of folks have dessert at lunch-time!)  ;)\nI enjoyed the Tiramisu!\nNow, some people like it when the lady fingers in Tiramisu are very Rummy tasting, but I am not a fan of too much of that!\nThis was perfect and delicious!\nI would def recommend it!\n\nAll in all... Lidia's = WIN!\n\n\nPROS:  \nDelicious;\nPre-bus galore!\n\nCONS:\nParking (but you can park in the \""dust bowl\"" across the street.\nLocated in the strip\nPretty busy on the weekends!"
"2","I didn't really know what to expect from Lidia's, but in all it was the perfect meal for us travelers. \n\nThe experience started off a little rocky, but at every progression of the meal, the experience got better and better. \n\n. The Strip was a ghost town on a Saturday night (during the Kenny Chesney concert). Upon opening the doors to Lidia's, the interior was bustling... with old people! While the decor seemed modern and edgy, the clientele was decked out in rinestone-encrusted tshirts and argyle. Yikes!\n\nWe kept changing our reservation number throughout the day, and by the time we arrived, our party was officially a party of four instead of six. I'm not unsympathetic to needing to do some table switching to accommodate us, but it appeared as if the hostess meant to solve the problem and then forgot about us once another problem arose. After a fairly long wait off to the side, one of our party went to the podium to ask about our table. Apparently, they had forgotten about us, but we were seated quickly after the mistake was realized. (Sidenote: the hostess' outfit was really unintentionally inappropriate. Part of her top was sheer, and would have been tastefully so if she didn't have her bra and underwear sticking out in awkward places, unbeknownst to her.)\n\nAnyway! I guess I can see how people think Lidia's is too much like an Olive Garden, but once you look at the ingredients and the preparation methods, it really isn't at all. I guess people see \""unlimited pasta\"" and their minds go somewhere a little less sophisticated. Don't fall into this trap! Everything was expertly prepared with balanced flavors and appropriate portioning. \n\nI had the pasta trio (like everyone else, amirite!?) and indeed, the beginning portions of the pasta were small. The point is to sample, and then get more of what you prefer, even if it's all of them. I wouldn't want huge globs of pasta on my plate (getting cold, cheese and sauces congealing), so I appreciated this approach. Your followup portions come by with waiters carrying large metal pans of small-batch prepped pasta. All of the pasta tasted freshly made (not dried) and with exceptionally light and  balanced sauces. Perfect.\n\nI feel like you have to get the pasta trio at least once. The other entrees looked amazing as well. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would focus my ordering on the rotating seasonal entrees. \n\nMy Cesar salad was a little overdressed for my tastes, but still very flavorful and fresh. The bread basket was above-average, with at least three different warm options and two spreads (an olive and pesto spread). \n\nDessert was inventive, a lemon cake with a basil layer and poppyseed ice cream. The other elements escape me, but it was nice that my table mate gave me a bite. \n\nService was great, if a little slow towards the end. I enjoyed their wine selections, though one of the reds was much better alone (not with food), and probably  shouldn't have been on the menu. Though the wine list is quite extensive, there's a smaller, curated list of bottles for $28. It kept our choices (and bill) a little more manageable. So glad I got to try Lidia's!"
"2","as a big fan of Lidia's, i was anxious to eat at her restaurant, and it was totally awesome. would highly recommend.  Food was excellent. wait staff was attentive. we arrived early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  it was a lot of fun and the decor was awesome too."
"1","I went to Lidia's this past week for dinner with a group of 6 friends. The service was one of the worst I have ever had. The waitress was rude to us from the minute we didn't order alcohol to the second we signed our bills. We politely asked at the time of placing our orders if it would be possible to have separate checks. It's a group of people having dinner together, who carries cash anymore?  Waitstaff should expect to be asked for separate checks. I understand it makes for a bit more work to run a few more cards at the end of the meal, but when the waitress disdainfully states \""I can do that, but you will just have to be patient with me at the end of your meal as separate checks cannot disrupt the service of my other tables.\"" it is a big indication of how the rest of the evening would go. If she gave as much inattention to her other tables as she did to ours, no one would have even noticed she was taking a few extra minutes running separate checks. We rarely saw our waitress except when she needed to sell us food. Thank goodness for the other staff that were available to refill our drinks, our bread and our pasta. Otherwise I think we would still be sitting there 4 days later with empty glasses and stomachs!\n\nSpeaking of empty stomachs-I wish I hadn't filled my stomach and emptied my wallet with the food we were served. I ordered the pasta trio. The salad was good and unfortunately the best part of my meal.  I was excited to try the 3 pastas when they came out. But that excitement quickly disappeared as I took a few bites. Seriously?!  A revered Italian restaurant serving overdone pasta?!  It was the most bland arrabiatta sauce I have ever had. The jarred stuff I have in my cabinet at home has a 100 times more flavor than this and I don't even serve that over such limp noodles as what this place did. The pesto sauce on the gnocchi was good, but again the pasta was well past it's doneness. The best pasta was the gemmeli with the sausage/broccoli rabe sauce, but it was extremely oversalted and left my mouth feeling like it does after I've eaten too much ham on Easter. \n\nI had high hopes that dessert would salvage this meal!  Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed when we ordered the nutella custard that was to come with caramel bananas. The waitress said that they didn't have bananas for it because their shipment they had received that day were too green. The restaurant is in The Strip District!! Go down a few blocks to Stan's Market and buy ripe bananas to serve with your dessert!  She was going to serve a custard with nothing else until my friend suggested that they use strawberries that were listed on another dessert as a substitute.  The dessert was good, but I would have definitely preferred bananas over the strawberries we ended up with. \n\nLidia's had been on my list of restaurants to try ever since it opened years ago. I can now mark it off my list and never return. Between the waitress's attitude towards us all night to the quality of our meals, it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. So disappointed!"
"1","The NY restaurant is much better.  We were eating here often, but it got boring quickly. The staff are great and the location is good for people who drive into Pittsburgh. I'd like to see some the dishes that make the NY restaurant great."
"2","Overall this was good Italian food if you're ready to venture into something more asventerous than Olive Garden.  I had the pasta trio and thought the ravioli was amazing.  Everything else was pretty good, but a butternut squash ravioli made the meal.  Be prepared to spend about $30 a person for the full experience and I'll remember this meal for a while."
"1","soooo disappointing!  i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes.  also, having lived for some time in NYC, i am familiar with and a fan of Bastianich restaurants.  one of the best meals i've ever had in my life (there aren't many) was at Del Posto.  the Bastianich name to me stands for integrity and love / appreciation / sharing of high quality italian food.  then, i ate here.  are these the same people running this restaurant?!  it was completely mediocre and subpar, as if no one cared about the quality or experience.\n\ni came here for brunch and did the pasta trio and antipasti table.  it was clear the ingredients were not quality and the dishes were mass produced without much flavor or thought.  it was only $25 a person, but can you make an effort?  don't you care about your reputation and good name?  guess not.\n\nthis restaurant seems to be a sellout - a place to make money off the name in a place where the food standard frankly isn't that demanding or high (like in NYC).  also, the service was not that good.  too bad."
"2","After walking around the Strip District, this certainly hit the spot. We did the buffet, and I got the pasta trio. I was not disappointed. Endless amounts of great pasta, plus everything else that came with the buffet table. It's a classy place, but people from all walks of life were eating there, from people dressed in Steelers gear to older, well-dressed couples. I'd definitely come back or go to her other restaurant."
"1","My family had been planning to go to Lidia's for a while, and finally made a reservation for my dad's birthday. I was not really impressed with the whole experience overall. We got there for our reservation and it took a while for anyone to come greet us at the front of the place, even though it wasn't very busy. They seated us outside, but the outdoor seating is right next to the street and it wasn't very pleasant. They were nice enough to move us inside without complaint. We ordered drinks, which took a long time to get there. I had the pasta trio special, I really liked the idea of getting to sample three different fresh recipes. I only really liked one (I know it changes up though) and only got a refill of that one. My sister got the seafood alfredo, which she said was good. I don't even remember what my parents ordered because it wasn't very memorable. Although the service was decent and the food was okay, I was just generally unimpressed and felt like we paid a lot for just a \""meh\"" experience and food."
"1","One word; gross. This is not Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food. The ravioli is not fresh - how difficult is it for a restaurant to make fresh ravioli? The decor is tacky. The wine list is lacking. I could rip this place apart after only one disappointing meal, but I'm not going to waste my time. In short, avoid this place! You can do much better in your own kitchen!"
"2","Each experience I've had at Lidia's was positive.  I've visited the restaurant several times, but mostly for lunch or brunch.  The food is delicious and well prepared, though it can be a bit pricey.\n\nI've visited Lidia's most frequently for brunch, and find the value to be top-notch.  For $25, you have a large antipasti table selection, your choice of entree, a generous dessert table selection, and complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Other restaurants of this caliber would charge separately for all this food, putting the total bill far higher.  The foods are fresh and reflect a wide variety of Italian foods, not necessarily the same foods you would find at your corner Italian restaurant featuring spaghetti and lasagna.  \n\nThe food is good, but perhaps doesn't quite meet the high expectations people have before their first visit.  Letting go of the unnatural expectation that every bite of food you eat from a celebrity chef restaurant will be life-changing, you will have a pleasant and positive experience at Lidia's.  \n\nWhen we excitedly told the wait staff we were celebrating my birthday with them, they brought me a complimentary flour-less chocolate cake which was absolutely incredible.  The service at Lidia's is incomparable, always making you feel like the king or queen of the room.   \n\nI would recommend Lidia's to anyone looking for a quality Italian lunch or dinner with an upscale atmosphere.  This restaurant would be great for dates and special occasions."
"1","I am reading through these reviews and wonder if we went to a different Lidia's Pittsburgh, because on our romantic Valentine's Day the Olive Garden would have been more fresh and authentic (p.s. it's neither of those things). My husband and I loved her cooking show and figured that her restaurant would be something we would like to try, boy were we way off. Maybe it was our fault for choosing a holiday but it was their fault for cutting corners, in the worst way possible, FLASH FROZEN FOODS!  They had a fixed menu with some options, but we already knew we were going to be charged $48 per person, which was pretty pricey, but maybe it was worth it, well it wasn't. First course was a fried ball that apparently had lobster in it, all you could taste is how much work the fryer had put in for the day, and it was a lot. Second course, couldn't wait, Caesar salad and a dish with shrimp and spaghetti squash,  salad was ok, the shrimp you couldn't taste because they were the little frozen ones that are cute when breaded but when they aren't they just look sad, as if they had never been in the sea (which I am banking these hadn't).  Then finally main entr\u00e9e, we held out hope thinking we there could still be a chance, again the price was $48 PER PERSON! My husband had gotten the tuna, JOKE, this made me maddest of all, it was pescado without the pescado part. We could have dealt with a small piece of FRESH tuna, but seeing as how this was an average piece of flash frozen crap with the grill marks already on it, thank goodness those poor chefs didn't have to actually grill a piece of fish. My pasta trio dish was ok, nothing about it screamed high and or fresh quality foods.  The worst part was that the service was excellent other than he could see on our faces we wanted nothing to do with the food, so he never asked how it was, but he was fantastic. So after the frozen crappy desert or finger food, that was horrid, we got our bill all said and done with a glass of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip, we paid $150.00! So save your money and go to spaghetti warehouse at least you know what you're getting.  Lidia, YOU OWE US MONEY!"
"2","This was my first experience at Lidia's and it was amazing.  It was a rare evening out for my wife and I and we enjoyed our meal immensely. \n\nThe food was very good...3 to 4 stars at least.  We ordered the pasta Trio and the creativity behind the dishes was very impressive.  The only thing taking away from it was the execution on the pasta itself. The fettuccine was cooked well past al dente and bordered on soggy.  The ravioli however were perfect And the flavor profiles on all the dishes were spot on\n\nThe reason I gave a five star review on 3 to 4 star food was the service. Everyone without exception was very attentive, friendly, helpful, and generally awesome.  This team could've served hot dogs and it still would've seem like an amazing experience."
"1","I've eaten plenty of less-than-delicious Italian food, but fortunately more of the delicious kind, whether in the motherland or here at home in the states. While I had high expectations for Lidia's, it gets lumped into the former category. I really hate to say this, but Olive Garden's dishes have more flavor than those we ordered at Lidia's (and I don't even like OG...). I ordered the pasta trio and all three were oh so bland, as was my mother's lasagna bolognese. My S.O. ordered the boar raviolis (I know they weren't called that, but I know nothing of porcines as far as food goes) and thought they were just 'meh' and too salty.  The menu was pretty limited, and it was especially underwhelming considering the prices of the dishes. I wouldn't return here, there are a couple of other restaurants in Pgh that I would rather visit next time i'm in the mood for Italian. Service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant though."
"2","It's been a while since I've written about Lidia. Well, Lidia's, not Lidia the person. After a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good graces with their massive brunch spread.\n\nI will give you ample warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap ton of food! And the best part? It's a bargain! For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody Mary. Isn't that a bloody good time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me out afterwards!\n\nThe buffet is awesome, with tons of traditional anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty mussels. \n\nFor your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, and rare it came out! It was very flavorful and I liked the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal to be on the menu, but it was delicious. I'd have to say even better than the salmon. I loved stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant (could you imagine the horror if they were instant?). \n\nWith all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional tiramisu, which was fantastic! I like tiramisu that's not too espresso tasting and this was perfection. Very light and tasty. The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. Even better than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. But it would have been all worth it, I swear!\n\nSo heed my warning, friends! You will thank me as you're rolling yourself outta there!"
"2","Not a place I'd return to for regular fare, overpriced for quality.  But the brunch is a divine value."
"2","My husband watches Lidia every Saturday on Create.  We make a weekend trip to Pa, and were both excited to visit this restaurant.  Per other reviews, we chose to go to Sunday brunch.  This was an excellent choice.\nYou're offered complimentary mimosa or Bloody Mary.  You then have an antipasti buffet which has a staff member who stands there making sure everything is kept fresh, and to answer any questions.  He also took our soup to our table to allow us to continue getting items from the buffet.  You have about 16 choices on the buffet, not including soup, meats.\nWe both chose to have the pasta trio - where you are initially given 3 small portions of the daily special pasta, with ordering more as needed.\nThe desserts are phenomenal.  You have cookies, fruit, tiramisu, cakes.\nIf my husband wasn't as full as he was, I would have had him roll me out the door ;-)"
"2","Our boss treated some co-workers and myself to lunch here last week (one of my colleagues was leaving) and had a terrific time. The decor is amazing and so is the food. I had the Porchetta panino (pulled pork Shoulder with horseradish apple salsa) which came with these parsely-seasoned home fries. All of it was amazing. Like Darren (I was so jealous he got to go there back in February and I didn't), I had the Torta di Cioccolatta, and it was godly. The service was on-target too. I love this place and that it's so close to where I now work. Seriously gourmet."
"1","I visited Pittsburgh for the weekend and was excited to try Lidia's since I have been to  her son's outstanding restaurants up in New York.\n\nLidia's was a major disappointment for me. Decor and service were just fine, no issues there. \n\nBut the food was something I would expect from a chain restaurant like Carrabba's or Olive Garden. The quality seemed poor: bread was soggy, greens and salad dressings way over salted, greasy, sloppy pasta sauces, and huge portions just slapped onto dirty plates with greasy fingerprints all over the edges. Plus, I spent the entire meal swatting flies away from our table.\n\nI was really puzzled by this experience. When you dine at Joe's restaurants, you get the sense that every single ingredient is hand selected for the highest quality and the presentation of the food shows care went into it.  I expected a similar standard at Lidia's. I wondered if Lidia visits this restaurant often and whether she knows about the quality of the food. Celebrity chefs often seem to suffer from this issue: they get involved in so many business ventures and if they are not at the restaurants regularly, the quality suffers.\n\nSorry to say it, but I definitely won't be back to Lidia's."
"2","Lidia's is a good restaurant for Italy food.  Though there is little bit loud, food here are really awesome. \n$6 is needed for valet."
"1","I'm not sure why people like this place so much.  The wait was long, the food came out cold, and the pastas were overcooked, gluey, greasy messes. The service was friendly but the food was very poor. Will never go back."
"1","I've had some excellent meals here when there were 3 or 4 of us.  I've had two group functions that were  way less than wonderful. I would not entertain having an event for any more than 4 people.  Even 10 people taxed the staff!"
"2","Went here for an early Valentine's Dinner last night. The service was great. We both ordered the pasta trio and the waiters' were very attentive at filling up our plates as soon as they neared empty. We also got the Polito appetizer to start and it was delicious- mix of octopus, potatoes, capers, onions and olives. Also, their wine bottles for $29 are a great deal. Just took off one star for the decor- a little outdated. Still a great night though- definitely recommend."
"2","Great food and service, very pleased with my Valentine's day dinner here.  Planning to come back to try more of their fare, since their Valentine's day menu was limited."
"2","I visited a few years back and had quite a pleasurable experience. The Sunday brunch for $25 included your choice of a mimosa or bloody mary, unlimited access to the soup/antipasti/salad buffet, entr\u00e9e of choice and unlimited trips to the dessert table. This is quite a value, plus everything was delicious. The fresh pasta trio is amazing. My only complaint involved the background music. The house system was playing classic rock, which is totally inappropriate and out of place for such a nice establishment."
"1","What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian \""signature\"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates at buffet. All yours for $28 per person!"
"2","Another great (WEEKEND) brunch at Lidia's. $28.00 Prix fixe.  Today I had the Yellow Fin Tuna special.  Seared Yellow Fin with Broccoli Rabe and mango salsa verde.  I did not expect the portion to be so big.  I actually had to get it wrapped to take home.  Their Antipasto table is always delicious with seasonal additions.  Today, among the regular fare, (like their marinated/seasoned olives) there were mussels, a broccoli salad and caramelized onions atop crunchy bread.  All Yummy !! \nMy Yellow tail special was cooked perfectly and delicious; I was really surprised at the large piece of tuna.  (posted pic) I did have reservations (recommended) so I was seated immediately and the service here is always stellar.  For $28.00 you can not get a better meal (and a drink)  You will be full by the time you leave, and the food is so creative and scrumptious.  The staff never rushes you out !!  Take your time, eat and eat more and enjoy !!  Just some FYI.  The $28. brunch is only on Sat & Sun. There is LOT parking right across the street, on Smallman St., with tons of spaces.  Today it was $6.00 for all day parking; I have never seen it above $10.00.   Worth it because it is right at Lidia's front door and if you planning on visiting the Strip Shops afterwards, it is an all day price.  Much better than looking for street parking and walking for blocks.  \nYelp asks if this place is good for kids ??  This is kind of hard to answer.  It is a casual place but \""upscale\"" casual if that makes sense.  Children are never an issue for me if they are well behaved and entertained.  Speaking only of their \""brunch\"" I would say OK for kids but the cuisine is not really geared towards a child.  If you bring a child under the age of 12 well, I think you may have to feed them from the dessert bar.  I just don't think that they would find the antipasto table or creative menu options appealing.  When I was 12, I did not even know what Antipasto meant.  Hey, thats just me. :)"
"2","Had dinner with my son last night and it was fabulous. He went for the ribeye and I had roasted chicken. We started with the grilled calamari which was decent, could have used more calamari and less chick peas. The main courses were cooked perfectly and delish!  Definitely will go back when returning to Pittsburgh."
"1","We finally made it to Lydia's and unfortunately it was disappointing! \nThe olive spreads that come with the bread basket were gritty and tasteless. \nThe lasagne I ordered was flavorless as well. The pasta in the lasagna was a nice texture. \nMy husband ordered the $42 steak, he ordered it mid rare and it was a bit over cooked but the issue with the steak was the flavor if a dirty grill. \nThe Tiramisu was very good also the calamari appetizer was terrific. \nThe service was good but she hovered too much for me personally. \nWe also had several drinks....\nSo, in the end $180 left a bad taste in my mouth.........."
"1","Went yesterday after my daughter's college graduation.  When the grad ceremony ran longer than expected, I called the hostess to let her know we had been delayed but were departing and hoped to be there soon.  As we were sitting in traffic, I received a call from a man who identified himself as the general manager and rudely asked if I still intended to be dining there.  After I explained our delay and that I had just spoke with the hostess, he (again very rudely) wanted to know how much longer I thought it would take for me to get to the restaurant.  \n\nWe arrived at Lydia's about 30 minutes late for a mid-afternoon reservation.   There were several large parties but quite a number of open tables.  Upon presenting at the hostess table, neither the hostess or the general manager acknowledged us for several minutes while they continued some discussion between the two of them.  We were seated at a small round table tucked in a corner - very small for a party of five.\n\nOur server arrived and explained the menu, which was the buffet brunch at the time. He spoke so quickly and mumbled so much that we had trouble understanding him.  We ordered our drinks and he indicated he would take our order when he returned with the drinks.  He later returned without our drinks and told us that they needed to break down the buffet to prep for upcoming dinner service so we could not have the antipasto or dessert portions of the brunch. Instead they would charge us ala carte but we would be limited to the entrees on the brunch menu and they could provide a Caesar salad or cup of soup.  He the left and returned later to take our order - still no drinks. \n\nWe eventually received Caesar salad (not fresh, limp and overdressed) and drinks.  We were seated within view of the antipasto buffet and were able to observe that we were on to the service of our entrees well before the antipasto buffet was broken down. Clearly there was no reason that our menu needed to be so restricted.  \n\nFood was ok.  Chicken was salty and overpowered by capers.  Individuals who ordered pasta trio indicated two of three were good.  Unfortunately, the table set up required the server to hold the pasta skillet over my lap in order to serve those seated on the other side of the table.  No mishaps but a few close calls.  Amounts provided in first serving were small and it was nearly impossible to get an additional serving.  Two individuals never did receive the second serving of one of the pastas that they requested.  We were able to order from dessert menu.  Desserts were unremarkable and very small.  \n\nService was horrible.  Our server did not return.  Took great effort to flag him down for additional drinks.  House wine and mimosa were overpriced at $12 and $13 respectively given size and quality.\n\nGentleman bussing our table was the only positive of our experience. He was friendly and accommodating.\n\nI will not return again and would discourage others as well."
"1","Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio, which was recommended by the waitress and was labeled on the menu as \""all you can eat\"".  The staff service gave small portions of each and hardly returned for further portions.  If I wanted \""all you can eat\"" I would have been at the restaurant all night waiting to be served.  The pasta was cold when served.  The frozen pasta from my son's school fundraiser was better.  I would not recommend nor would I ever return."
"2","My family and I came here for Sunday brunch to celebrate my father's birthday.  We were seated around noon and I was starving.  As other people have said, don't you dare eat a single thing before you come here or you will have to be rolled out like Violet Beauregarde.\n\nThey start you off with a complimentary blood mary or mimosa.  Um, hai.  I like your style.  And you pick your entree (of course, the famous pasta trio is an option).\n\nThen you get to take your fill of their antipasto spread.  A dozen different salad options, mussels, cheese, olives, frittata...  I had to try a bit of everything and yes, I was that person walking back to my table with two plates.\n\nMy entree was duck gnocchi.  I felt a little guilty because I adore duckies but damn was it tasty.  The gnocchi were like little pillows they were so light and fluffy.  Lidia, WHAT IS YOUR SECRET!?  Best gnocchi I have ever had (and I don't even really like it that much; something about it just called to me).\n\nAnd then they wrap you up with a dessert table.  I was about read to pop and we had homemade ice cream and cake at home but I couldn't stop myself.  The little cookies were crisp and perfectly satisfying to wrap up a meal.  But I didn't stop there.  You're at Lidia's, you eat the tiramisu.  Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, and perfect with a cup of coffee.  That coffee was so good, I didn't even need cream and sugar.\n\nSlight downfalls: the waiter didn't know who was the birthday person (discreetly ask if you don't know, just don't plunk it down in front of someone) and the wait staff cleared away all serviceware before I was done.  I still had bread on my plate and I also needed a knife to cut through the baguette French-toast-like dessert - would have liked to enjoy it but I couldn't.\n\nAll in all, a great brunch.  Definitely the place to go for a special occasion."
"1","Only average at best and when you figure in the slow service, cold food and high price i cant even give it an average rating. You can get better Italian food at any hole in the wall in Philadelphia, New York or Boston any time. i wanted to love it so much after watching Lidia on TV but the restaurant doesn't bring her own magic to the table it seems."
"2","Classy Wonderful establishment. Visited for my mother's 60th birthday.   She was astonished. For that very reason,  I love this place. The food was great the servicew was excellent.  Kudos to Waiter Cheno!!!  Well definitely visit again."
"2","Having basic cable for a few years now, I guess I missed who Lidia is. But her restaurant is sure nice. Wonderful and attentive service, nice atmosphere, and large portions of tasty food. I had the gnocchi, which comes with duck ragu - fantastic! I'm a huge fan of duck, and this was a new approach for me. The duck played really well with the thick ragu sauce. Not the best potato dumplings in a gnocchi, but still quite good. My friends dishes were also great, especially the lasagna which was massive.\n\nA nice comfort Italian joint with some unique twists and lovely service. Strikes me as a good spot that can please many different tastes."
"2","I've been here for a brunch which I really enjoyed. You just helped yourself to a buffet. It was of course scrumptious! Don't remember exactly what I had but remember it was good!"
"1","A restaurant that has gone steeply downhill...\n\nIt's been roughly 2-3 years since I have been to lidias, an experience in which I remember having decent food and service... Tonight was far different.\n\nOverall, let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated. Colors and decor seem boring and out of style. I didn't get that warm feeling I should in a place where there are white clothes, $12 average glasses of wine (like come on - I looked up the crappy bottle it came from) and waiters everywhere.\n\nThe service was horrible. From hostess crew to the bar to the waitress, it was bad. The hostess forgot about us, then when I reminded him we were waiting (40 minutes - despite a reservation), to which he said \""oh yes, I was just going to get you\""... But he wasn't because we stood there a few minutes while he set the table. Rude.\n\nDid I mention the service was bad? Well, while we were waiting we had a glass of wine each (a steep $13.50 glass each - definitely didn't live up to my expectations). The bar staff wasn't concerned with us and weren't friendly at all. They were chatting to themselves and basically ignoring us.  When we got to the table, it took 10 mins to meet our waitress. Then it took another 15 to order.  Then 50 mins to get our food!!! I had the pasta trio (remember this meal takes no time to cook  - as this is ready made and constantly being served) and my wife had the porkchop. Honestly, we typically enjoy our restaurant food (just read my Casbah review) but our food was really just so-so. My wife's pork chop was fatty and over-cooked (despite the waitress specifically making note of how the chef prefers to cook it medium). My pasta was decent, which I ate, and requested seconds (which is allowed for the trio because they give you very small portions).... However, seconds never came. Waitress didn't even know until I told her politely. Then she blamed new staff working the pasta routes... No good enough reason for me - sorry. \n\nThen the bill.  I ordered the pasta trio for $23 and the waitress asked me if I wanted to upgrade my Salad for $2, to which I approved. However she charged the $36 pasta trio (which comes with desert). I told her this was a mistake and she agreed and ran back with a new check. Now I had a $10 salad and $23 pasta trio. I was expecting $23 +$2 salad upgrade. Nope. So I explained to her politely that I ordered the $23 trio to which she (must have) mistakenly offered me an upgrade. I accepted. However I was told I was wrong and she didn't offer to make this right. Ugh. Seriously you want to fight me on it? Especially when I know I was being appropriately (not like I was trying to score a free meal). Isn't the rule \""customer is always right\""?\n\nFinally, we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined. How many people did we see in tie-dye shirt or wearing hats (literally wearing hats at 8:30pm in a fine dining restaurant)? We saw enough to know that this isn't the lidias we expected.\n\nWe won't ever go back or recommend the place.  As far as we are concerned - there is a very good reason that you don't have a problem getting a reservation here (because IT STINKS!). \n\nAvoid!"
"1","What a disappointment. When the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us, we should have known it would be that kind of evening. Worst part of the meal was the pasta trio--the limpest, pastiest, most tasteless mass of lukewarm pasta I have ever been served. One waiter saved the day by insisting I reorder, while everyone else in the joint was content to let us stew. Every aspect of the experience was substandard although when I reordered, the beet salad was very good. Overall, Lidia should be ashamed to have her name on a place like that."
"1","We were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful. The restaurant is too large with modern decor with hideous red plastic/leatherette chairs but at lunchtime it had no character. There was no background music. The waiter was young and inexperienced. It seems that now that Lidia is famous she is no longer involved in the cooking  so the food is like any larger chain or worse without the quality control. Table cloth was dirty, the staff was not friendly and the decor and furniture were unkept. The best part were the breadsticks and dips with olive oil. Would not recommend it."
"2","We have been to Lidia's twice now, and have received delicious food and excellent service both times.  We have only been on weeknights, and with reservations, however, so I'm not at all discrediting the reviews that discussed poor service on weekend nights and/or without reservations.\n\nThe pasta trio special was good when I had it, but my favorite dish is the gnocchi with duck ragu. I also loved my husband's wild boar ravioli. Skip the overpriced wine and order one of the house sodas instead. The ginger cranberry is fabulous!  We also love love love the frico and burrata appetizers. The frico is large and rich enough that it's really enough for two people, but the appetizers are yummy, so everyone might as well get their own and bring home whatever they can't finish.  \n\nNote to parents of babies, this restaurant is very family friendly, in our experience. We loved bringing our infant daughter here and were pleased that the restaurant offers slings for carseats for the smaller babies as well as highchairs for babies who are of sitting up age (many places don't have the slings). The lady's room and its changing station were very clean. The staff often stopped to smile back at the baby when she was smiling at them, and our waiter asked if we needed anything for her. Not necessary, but very nice, and appreciated.\n\nThey have valet parking, but we just park about a block away and walk, since we sometimes enjoy walking further down the strip district, anyway."
"2","Have always had superior meals here. Wine selection is good. Service is always top-notch."
"1","Lidia, you should be ashamed! This spot wouldn't have lasted a year in NYC. Citizens of Pittsburgh, don't be fooled. Lidia's is average at best. I ate here when it opened,a and again 4 years later. Nothing has changed. We did have some great bar nibbles, quality cocktails, and a good bottle of wine off of a pretty good list, but the food and service lacked. For starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads. The took away everything and only brought back fresh salads (mind you, we were one of about 10 tables being served that evening!). The entrees were dull and lacked seasoning. The servers were confused (how many times does it take to ask fro fresh pepper?) and our waiter seemed to hand off our table to another server. It's tough to find anything good here. Just another 'poser'."
"1","SETTING:\nNice environment that was able to cater to groups of all sizes, from small parties to even an ugly sweater party (this really happened!). Kind of dresses itself up to be a nice sit-down place, but unfortunately, the food was not on the same level.\n\nFOOD:\nFor appetizers, I shared the Calamari with my friend and for the main entree, I got the recommended Pasta Trio. \n\nFirst off, I love calamari. A lot. I've definitely had better at similar quality establishments. The calamari was very bland and did not taste fresh. The batter was not crisp and crunchy. The sauce tasted watered down. The recommended \""Pasta Trio\"" (3 types of pastas and \""all you can eat\"") was a bit below average. For a recommendation, I expected more. Overall, the food was underwhelming. \n\nMy friend always cleans her plate. So clean, that it looks like she was served only the plate. This was the first time that she did not finish her dish (Chicken Cacciatore). She is not super picky, so this really meant she did not like it.\n\nThe type of food here is comparable to Olive Garden in terms of American-Italian fare, but I would rather eat at Olive Garden anyday. OG just tastes better and is way cheaper.\n\nSERVICE:\nMediocre at best. The waters were not kept filled. Not a huge deal for me since I drink slowly, but some of my friends kept looking for the water and it clearly distracted them from their dining experience. The Pasta Trio is \""all you can eat\"" and they come back to refill your plate. A few of us were waiting on the third round...and we never got it. Even though the food was not the tastiest, we were hungry and still needed to be fed. The wait staff didn't even ask if we wanted a third serving, and just took our plates quickly without giving us a chance. A few of us were still left a little bit hungry...it was a grumpy ride home :( \n\nIMPRESSIONS:\nRelative to the pricing of the food, I expected better quality. Even if the pricing was on par with comparable establishments, the quality of the food was lacking. I hate to say this, but we had a disappointing experience overall, from the food to the service."
"2","I'll start with the exceptional service.  The servers really act as a team. They each know the menu really well. I have a gluten allergy, which makes this very important. The timing of the meal was perfect.  Never waited too long for any part of the meal, but didn't feel rushed either.  \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is mixed. Casual, but nice.   It can get loud, and doesn't lend itself to a romantic evening.  That said, I find it very inviting. Table are a little close, but nothing too bad.\n\nThe food was very good, but not great.  Prices are a little high for Pittsburgh. The servers have always suggested the Pasta Trio, which my wife had.  Each of the three smelled fabulous. She enjoyed each, having a second helping of only one of the three, because they give you enough on the first go around.  With celiac disease, I was very happy to see they've added gluten free pasta to their menu.  I had their house made corn pasta ravioli filled with pumpkin & cheese in a brown butter sauce.  It was very good, but the texture was a little off. Prices for gluten free were reasonable. \n\nI'd still return here, although at these price levels, just not as often."
"1","Service was excellent.  The menu offerings were spotty.\n\nA group 16 of us attended the Saints-Steelers game in November.  We attend most of the away games and have an opportunity to eat at some very good restaurants.  \n\nLidia's was a place I was looking forward to because I am aware of her by reputation.   We had several appetizers including the bruschetta, which was really only to my liking.  The balsamic was excellent - syrupy and sweet - and clearly a nicely aged one.  But it was incongruous with the rest of the dish, and so not many enjoyed it.  \n\nThe bread served at the table was really very good and we devoured baskets of it. \n\nComments from some of the other diners:\n\n- Baked shrimp appetizer was pretty good, the calamari was very good.  \n- Rucola  salad was (in my opinion) excellent\n- Beet salad was interesting and overall very good\n- Butternut squash soup was enjoyed by several of us\n- Scampi alla Felidia was ordered by several guests with mixed opinions\n- Lasagna bolognese?  so so at best\n\nGnocchi and duck ragu was what I ordered.  I was very disappointed. The duck was shredded and cooked into a sort of red congealed, thick mass with little texture.  The gnocchi were so underdone as to be a sort of glutinous paste sitting under the duck.  The texture was completely unappealing but I do have to say that the flavor of the duck ragu (ragout?) was pretty good. \n\nStill, the gnocchi - one of my favorite things and something I make myself probably once a month - were a disappointment.  I didn't send it back because it didn't seem appropriate in the setting of a very large group to monopolize the wait staff.  \n\nI'd still give it a try again when I'm there in June, but it seems that some of their efforts are focused more on being creative, which is good, but falling somewhat short.\n\nBy the way, if you like a more traditional Italian and happen to be in St. Louis, Charlie Gitto's on the Hill is a great place. Similar in ambiance and quality to Lidia's, the service there can't be beat and the food is quite good as well."
"1","I had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced & bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by Stouffers. The service was excellent the food nothing great."
"1","This place is pretty poor and really needs to get it's act together because it's a disgraceful place to watch football, especially given the accessibility of technology these days.  First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a \""sports bar\""??  Give me a break.\n\nFood is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.\n\nI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room."
"1","I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things\n1. ESPN\n2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff\n3. beer specials\n4. big screen TVs.\n\nWell Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception."
"2","This place's food is great--I would suggest delivery though. They specialize in Turkish Pizzas (Pide) and wow they are good.  \n\nWhen you walk into a place it looks like some cafeteria/game room that survived a tornado.  The walls are cracking, the only two florescent lights on the ceiling are flickering, there are display coolers that are turned off, and there are only vending machines to get drinks. You can see into an expansive kitchen (I really think the place is a converted cafeteria) and it looked horridly disorganized and in shambles.  That's fine though, I had heard good things about it\n\nI got their Mediterranean Pizza (Tomatoes, Black Olives, Artichokes) and wow did it impress me. They either did one of two things: used a garlic glaze for the dough, which I am suspicious of because the crust didn't taste oily, or they have some kind of garlic butter in their dough. Either way, its fantastic. The whole thing was thick and fluffy with a perfect balance of fresh tomato sauce and cheese.  I loved it.  \n\nThe reason it gets four stars instead of five is that it just seemed to lack that \""holy shit\"" factor that pushes things over the top. I think if their upped their quality of ingredients it would push it to five stars, but their clientele base seems fairly small, so hipsters, get in on the bottom floor of this fad. \n\nDefinitely order delivery from them because the mezzanine level place is hard to get to and you have to get buzzed into the building."
"1","I only gave this place 2 stars because of the environment that it is in.  A \""hard to find place\"" is an understatement if it's dark outside and you have never been here.   I have to agree, the crust of the pizza is amazingly flakey and delicious.  I'm a crusty guy, so I like good crust and though it's up there with a soft boboli it's still easy to eat and won't rough up your mouth.  I ordered the Ephesus Pizza with lamb skewers ($16.00 large).  It is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers.  They packed on 8-9 small skewers of lamb and I have to admit, the lamb was very tasty and tender.  The problem I have with this place is the filthy, trash laden environment it sits in.  It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened...it was strange.  However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about.  when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing.  The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy.  All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been.  I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth.   I still like the pizza and I will only send my pot smoking, beer drinking partying friends to this place, because I would be afraid of what others may think of it and consequently, think of me and my tastes."
"2","Traditional pizza is awesome. Delivery is very fast as well. They always tell me 40 minutes and then arrive in 15-20."
"1","Pretty okay pizza.  Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza.  However , the fact that the delivery driver expected me to run from my second floor apartment out to the middle of the street to get it was not okay.  He was rude when I asked him to come up, talking about how he has other deliveries to make and he couldn't park (meanwhile, there were multiple open parking spaces directly in front of the apartment; as well as an entire parking lot right next door). \n\nAfter arguing with me for a few minutes, he finally decided to park and come up. I really don't want to have to argue with someone to get them to do their job when I order delivery. And I certainly don't want to have to leave my house, to go out in the cold, for what is supposed to be delivery.   Is it so strange to expect food delivery to make it to my actual doorstep?  This seems to be a recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting the customer to run out into the street to get their pizza.  It stopped me from ordering from another place, and it will stop me from ordering from Ephesus again."
"2","The Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum pizza is an exotic treat! I also liked their cinnamon sticks to death! Very good. I can't believe they delivered to us all the way from downtown in such short time. Awesome pizza joint."
"1","90 minutes for two cold pizzas.....sorry at this point even a two star review is generous.\n\nWhile in town with friends, we wanted an easy meal after running the half marathon earlier in the day.  Consulting Yelp, I saw that this place had good reviews, they delivered and since we were less than a mile from them, we figured we'd have the food fairly fast (there were two hungry toddlers and five hungry adults, and we needed food, stat!)\n\nUpon calling, we first asked if they delivered to hotels just to be sure.  If they didn't, that would be fine we'd call someplace else.  So we ordered our two pizzas and gave them the name and address of the hotel. It is a newish hotel, so I told my buddy to tell them \""It's right by the Consol Energy Center, where the Penguins play\"".  I figured that even if they didn't know the hotel or the address, most people in Pittsburgh would know where the Penguins play.  We were concerned when we had to say the name of the hotel four times and as it turned out, we were right to be concerned.\n\nAfter an hour with no pizzas, we call and they guy says \""Oh, the delivery guy is on your street right now.  Should be 2 minutes\"".  20 minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he's on his way.  We ask if he knows where he's going and he says yes.  10 minutes later he calls again and asks where we are.  When we finally got the pizza, it was not hot.  The cheese had congealed everywhere and it looked like it had been cut by a toddler.  There were so big slices, some little slices...just not the usual uniform slices.\n\nI felt bad for the guy because he said his GPS had been stolen that morning, but we tried everything to make sure that the place new we were at the hotel right beside the arena and it still failed.  \n\nBetter luck next time."
"2","Ephesus is special.  Fast friendly service.  Surprisingly comfy and stylish seating and lighting for a primarily take out shop.  A broad, customizable menu with a solid mix of Italian and Greek deliciousness.  Low prices, massive portions, and better prepared, home made, flavorful food than they have any right to offer at the prices they charge.  \n\nEphesus is not a 5 star culinary experience, but for the casual fare and reasonable rates they offer, I can't imagine a better choice.  Well done Ephesus, you set the bar for all other local delivery spots to try to live up to!"
"2","When you are there order the Ephesus Pizza. It is their signature pizza, cant go wrong. Has many recipes on it; vegetables, chicken or pork shish kabobs(yes,heard me right, shish kabobs on a pizza), honestly one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten."
"2","This is the best pizza I have found in Pittsburgh so far. It makes me sad that it has taken me four years of tasting quite mediocre pizza before finding this gem. So far my favorite is the steak pizza, however, it is all delicious."
"1","Too oily , i felt like im eating pure fat , even the bread is covered with oil ! I suggest they make it healthier with more whole wheat option, grape leaves are very dry and tasteless. Oh and their fries are terrible"
"1","Came here on a Sunday, it was slow and we got our food in good time.\n\nOrdered two personal size pizzas, spicy fries, fried zucchini & onion rings. \n\nThe pizzas were actually really good but the other sides weren't worth it. Tastes plain & over cooked. \n\nOk so the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because I saw soooo many health code violations! \n\n* A RedBull can on the pizza dressing table.\n\n* The woman who charged me was working on a pizza and didn't even wash her hands after she charged me! She just went right back to working on making the pizza! \n\n* The same woman who charged me -NOT kidding ...her nails were long & yellow, mind you she wasn't wearing any gloves while putting that pizza together. YUCK!! \n\n* Same chick went out for a cigarette break (in the front of the place) and when she was coming back in she brought AND blew the smoke inside the restaurant. \n\nPrice range in Yelp language is $$\n\nI definitely won't go back because if that's what I was able to witness in the front of the place, I don't want to imagine what's going on in the back!!! I don't think I'm being harsh. That was one too many violations in my opinion."
"2","This place is fanfreakingtastic.  \n\nThusly, I have had their Chicken Ranchero Pizza and their Greek Pizza, and their cheesy breadsticks, and good. gravy.  I can't even put into words how good the pies were.  The toppings were all super fresh, the meat expertly seasoned, the sauces to die for.  Their list of gourmet pies is mindblowing; their variety and inventiveness is spectacular.  I was skeptical about feta and fontina on my pizza.  Mea culpa.  I don't know if I'll ever go back to just run of the mill plain pies ever again.\n\nI've had my orders delivered all three times I've ordered from the place since moving there, and while they're a bit slow, it's worth the wait."
"1","Okay, so I've heard a lot of good things about this place. And I wanted to like it!\n\nBut it was seriously bad. I very rarely eat somewhere and don't finish my food simply because I don't like it. But I couldn't eat it. I got the Shadyside and it was super greasy, and the flavor just wasn't there. My roommate got the Portabella and she wasn't feelin' it either.\n\nThe guy who served us was cool beans though."
"2","This is a regular stop of mine because I work on the strip in Pittsburgh. I want to share that I have probably eaten here 40+ times so I have tried about 10 hoagies on the menu. I went with the regular Steak and cheese hoagie- grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo...add some hot sauce at the table, order of fresh cut fries and a drink. I get a work discount of 10% so anywhere you can eat lunch under $8 is awesome in any city.\n\nMy only complaint is that occasionally the meat to bread ratio isn't too great. Don't get me wrong I'm not expecting 12 ounces of meat but it can be disappointing. I recommend one of the more creative sandwiches then. Though the breads here are so fresh and enjoyable."
"2","Great place for a party!  I had a party here last night and the banquet facilities are top notch.  We had several hors d'oevres the lamb lollipops were awesome and a must have when you have an event here.  The lobster rolls were not memorable and I'd suggest you skip these when choosing your items.  The crabmeat stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  I was very impressed with our entrees we had a filet and crabcake dinner.  I'm always a little scared with mass produced filets, but they were all cooked perfectly.  The crabcakes had almost no filler and were jumbo lump crabmeat.  Dante is the banquet manager and very accomodating.  I definitely suggest you select the symphony a and b room for your event.  That's on the second floor with a great view of the north shore and pnc park.  They are not flexible on the food and beverage minimums, but if your party is big enough (I had about 50) they will throw in a complimentary room and may even waive the fee for the coat check girl.   Drinks are reasonable priced and if you request certain types of liquor they will provide them for you.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  The rooms have very comfortable beds and are spacious.  Make sure you request a room with a river view.  I also suggest not valeting.  It's $25 which is way too much for Pittsburgh."
"2","Very nice hotel in a great, convenient location."
"2","Priceline, 69 bucks.  Pick 4-star and downtown Pittsburgh and you'll get either this or the Omni.  Walking distance from all sporting events.  Use the self-park across the street and you'll save $$ over the valet (which also uses the same parking garage).  Rooms are small-ish, but the location is totally worth it.  Bar in the hotel has great service and good drinks.  Con- no longer affiliated w/ the Bally's next door (it went out of business), but they will give you a day pass to the Gold's a few blocks away."
"2","I never write reviews, but I have to recommend the Renaissance! The staff was ABSOLUTELY wonderful! I was traveling for business so I hardly had any down-time at the hotel... but I had a lovely, clean room with a nice bathroom. The parking garage across the street was very convenient and reasonably priced.\n\nWhen I checked out, I accidentally left my cell phone charger plugged into the wall and my raincoat in the closet (clearly I was in a hurry in the morning and not very careful!) I called the hotel that night and they were very nice and said someone from Housekeeping would get back to me the next day. Someone from housekeeping called me the next morning and she was so sweet. They mailed me both items for no charge (I offered to give them a credit card, but they said no.) I receive the package within 3 days of returning from my stay. They truly went above and beyond! I'd definitely recommend staying there."
"2","Beautiful old building, five minute walk to PNC park.  Our visit was to see the Phillies and get a taste of Pittsburgh.  Great view of PNC Park from our room.  I felt the hotel and service were first class, yet the place was not stuffy at all.  We will definitely be back!"
"2","HeeBee G.'s Axiom #1: If you use one of those discount hotel reservation sites, be prepared to be handed the keys to the \""pound puppy\"" room. \nAxiom #2: if you prize aesthetics over value, see Axiom #1\n\nFrankly, I do not spend much time in my room when I travel. I love the idea of staying in an overpriced hotel at a discount rather than emptying my wallet for the privilege of hanging out in the penthouse suite.\nUpon arrival at the Renaissance, I was greeted by one of the front desk staff...let's call him \""Mr. R.\"" I asked him for a nice room with a view. He chimed, \""no problem.\"" That was, until he called up my reservation which indicated that I had booked from another vendor. Suddenly, the hotel was \""overbooked\"" and a smirk spread across his face as if to tell me that I was lucky to have a room, even if it was the maintenance closet.\nI took my key and jumped on the elevator filled with the naivet\u00e9 that this time, just this one time, I could avoid the dreaded pound puppy curse.\nThe elevator doors opened and I was overwhelmed by a toxic odor. My floor was being renovated and a crew was in the lobby pasting up wall paper. I held my breath and darted for my room.\nI opened the door with both fear and anticipation. To my surprise, the room was completely updated; modern, sparkling clean, with a giant poofy bed and comforter. Off to a good start!\nI threw open the drapes to window #1 to reveal - TA DA - the most spectacular view of the tired, drab-blue parking garage across the street. \nNo prob I thought, let's see what's behind curtain #2: not only the drab-blue garage, but an enormous flag pole with Old Glory wafting in the wind. \nIn all fairness to Mr. R.; if I smashed my face against the window and looked to the right out of my one opened eye, I could see a view of the Allegheny River and PNC Park. Now, I was livin' large!\nAll kidding aside, the staff was friendly, professional, and attentive. I had forgotten some of my toiletries at home. They had them up to my room in no time at all.\nThe lobby is grand but a little confused in style. It is a combination of old time tile and marble with seventies disco-bordello, dark, red lighting. \nThe last night we were there we watched a stunning fireworks display from our room after the B-ball game at PNC. It really capped off a nice weekend in Pittsburgh.\nSo, Mr. R. came through for us after all and I have to admit that it was a 100 times better than the hotel room in New York City where I had a lovely view of the air shaft!"
"2","First time I have ever been to Pittsburgh. I'm not kidding, i had no idea what to expect. Here's what I found, specifically at this place.\n\nLocation- WOWzers. If you are going to a Pirates game, this is the primo location. Not kidding, right across from the Clemente bridge, you can go and get slizzed up before, during, after the game and walk right back\n\nParking- 5 bones for an all day pass at the self-parking garage across the street. May seem a little sketchy inside, but you are fine. Come on, $5, really?! It's $35 for a 3 hour baseball game at Yankee stadium..... I digress\n\nAmenities- Very clean, very cozy, very charming. Seems like this hotel has been there for quite some time, but has steadily been maintained and updated. Great overall feel to it. Free Wi-Fi too, tough.\n\nFood- The Braddock (probably not spelling it right) restaurant downstairs is a little pricey. You can walk around the area and find a really good food place for alot less. I'd say this may be the only con.\n\nLBD Scale- 9, very impressed with the place. If the food wasn't so expensive, I'd be back tomorrow. Still going to go back regardless, just need to figure out when."
"2","This is my default hotel when I'm staying in Pittsburgh.  The rooms were remodeled a few years ago, which was really needed.  This is a quiet hotel right in the heart of the business district.  Rooms are mixed - some are very small and have interior veiws, others are huge and have views of the river.  There is a very nice gym in the basement - cardio and strength equipment (if that isn't good enough, you can get a free pass to Golds a few blocks away).\n\nOne caution - this place does tend to fill up / usually the first hotel downtown to sell out."
"2","Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money."
"2","Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. I've stayed on the North Shore, Station Square and city outskirts before, but this was my first time down here. I was not disappointed.\n\n- Location is its biggest plus, right near the theaters and Heinz Hall. Also within a short walking distance to Gateway Station, Market Square and right across the Clemente Bridge to PNC Park. \n- Convenient parking garage right across the street. Cheap rates on the weekend.\n- Comparable and reasonable pricing (although I do get Gov. rate).\n- A couple of good restaurants on site.\n- Very nice room with a great view of the city.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to come back here again. A great find in the city."
"2","Beautiful spot for a wedding. Very clean, the food was amazing (not your average wedding fare) and a breathtaking view of the city.  I cannot imagine a more beautiful hotel venue for a wedding."
"2","This is my favorite hotel in Pittsburgh.\n\nYou can't beat the location.  In the heart of the theater district separated from PNC Park by only the Clemente Bridge, close to plenty of solid dining options, walking distance from Heinz Field, walking distance to nightlife . . . \n\nBig rooms with unbelievably comfortable beds.  Likely to have a gorgeous view of the river, bridges, and stadiums (directly across the river from PNC Park), easy parking (valet or parking garage directly across the street) . . . \n\n5 stars"
"2","I travel all over North America the majority of the year, and have stayed at almost every Renaissance in the US. I've gotta say, this one is one of my favorites. My stay was on a Thursday night, and had a room on the 10th floor facing East.\n\nIt's located right down town in the theater area, and it's an extremely easy walk to a lot of essentials. There are convenience stores a couple buildings down, and tons of bars and restaurants to check out all around.\n\nThe valets at the front door are extremely polite and will open the doors for you and call you a cab if you need it, and the front desk people are extremely friendly and will help you with whatever you need.\n\nThe rooms are great, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The rooms have large desks, which are great if you are doing paperwork or have to setup to do some business work in your room. TV's are great and have good programming, the beds are super comfy, and the bathrooms are large with good showers.\n\nAfter being here, this is probably the only hotel in Pittsburgh that I will ever want to stay at again."
"1","Good food worth waiting, and waiting, and waiting for...  Now wait & wait for the check."
"2","Lori was working at the front desk the evening we checked in (7/24/14).  She was fabulous!  Thanks for the help, Lori.\n\nBeautiful place, great Wi-Fi.\n\nErin"
"2","Great environment great location with easy parking and access to Downtown Pittsburgh."
"1","The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed at in a long LONG time. Paper thin wall,  poor booking practices ended us up in the middle of the most obnoxious wedding party ever. Drunk bride, hotel room parties until 3am, and an apparent lack of security to monitor anything going on in this hotel have lead to this rave early Saturday morning (and I do mean RAVE quite literally) review. And yes this was after the front desk was called several times with noise complaints. My best tip would be to not stay here unless the purpose of your stay is to not sleep."
"2","The potential for 5 stars was definitely there. The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location of Pittsburg. I was in hotel heaven when I walked into the lobby. It looked expensive and well taken care of. The customer service at check in was spot on. Laura (Lori?) was incredibly friendly and seemed genuinely happy we had chosen the Renaissance for our stay. She saw we booked our hotel through Priceline, and that didn't even affect her demeanor. She asked us a few questions about why we were in town and made me feel like I picked the right place to stay at. She then informed my husband and me that she happened to have a complimentary upgrade to a corner junior suite available. I didn't even ask, which is what made this even more wonderful. She confidently told us that we would love the room. \n\nWow! That room was insanely amazing. Laura was right! Panoramic views of the city, river, bridges and two stadiums. I felt so special having this upgrade and couldn't have asked for a better room. It was great watching the sunset with the option of looking out of any of the 7 windows in the room. The room d\u00e9cor was classy, modern and the bed was super comfy. I made sure to let Laura know that this really exceeded our expectations. \n\nThe reason my experience wasn't five stars was because of the room service. Ever since I was little, I have loved to order room service. It's just something I have to do. My first call in to room service was for a bottle of wine. I was quoted a 30 minute wait, which was reasonable to me. It took about 20 minutes, which I was pleased about. I signed my bill and added my tip. When the gentleman left, I was looking over my bill and thought it seemed really high. I completely didn't realize that a 20% gratuity was already included on top of the room service fee. I had tipped him $5 already, so he made out with $10 in tips. I felt really silly after that and tried to justify in my head why spending $43 on a $27 order was okay. My husband made me feel better by saying it is vacation, don't stress about it. \n\nThe next morning I really was craving a croissant and a beverage. I asked if they had croissants a la carte, which they did. The gal said she could have my order in 15 minutes, but probably less. Wow, that's great, I thought. However, don't overpromise and under deliver. If you are going to claim it will be 15 minutes or less, then I am expecting that. After 30 minutes of waiting, I finally called only to hear the lady tell me my food was on the way. When it arrived, it was the saddest looking croissants I've ever seen. They gave me two mini, stale croissants. I took a picture and couldn't stop laughing about how tiny they were. They obviously were not fresh either."
"2","I love the Convention Center.  I go to the car shows every year here, and they always put together a great program no matter what it is.  It is a great venue with a ton of room.  Not to mention, they have little concession stands set up that serve up some delicious food that will keep you satisfied."
"2","A friend and I came here last month for a car show and had a pretty good time. The place is ginormous! It's also clean, and that's pretty much all I can say about it. We didn't eat there, so I can't comment on the food. The convention center is probably underutilized. I'd like to see a big comics convention come here for instance."
"2","I was lucky enough that the conference I had to attend (which changes cities every year) was in Pittsburgh the year I gave a seminar! I really enjoyed riding the bus downtown to the Convention Center everyday, and the venue is really beautiful. Located right on the river, the balcony views from the upper tiers of the center are pretty fantastic. Furthermore, the maze inside was pretty easily navigable- this was really important to me because I had to get in and out of rooms quickly as seminars started and stopped every 20 minutes. Compared to other venues I've been to across the country, the David L. Lawrence Convention Center stacks up well. It was great to see Pittsburgh showcased in such a great light."
"2","This has to be one of the nicer convention centers I've been to. Parking was easy and but not cheep at $10. It is located right in the river with large floor to ceiling windows that make the already large space seen even larger.\n\nThere are several floors to this place and I was only on the 2nd for the Farm to Table tasting event here last night. The set up was nice and not once did I feel packed in like sardines. The area was closed off by curtains so we couldn't see the great view this place offers but it was still a very functional space. \n\nThe event itself offer lots and lots of great food and wine to taste and purchase if you felt so inclined. There were a few standouts at this event. Nemicolin with there pork belly from foot print farm and grits was just amazing. So much so that I plan on making a trip out for a tasting in the next few months. Letrec here I come. Also I purchased 2 bottles from R wine cellar. Both bottles are there spiced wine. Also got a Tuscan herb infused olive oil from the enchanted olive. Amazing!!! \n\nOverall this I had a great experience and won't think twice about coming to another event here. Might take my boy to the dinosaur event this weekend. We'll see."
"1","I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Err not too sweet. I live in Bloomfield near the Childrens Hospital. Took my moo moo pie on a walk down (about 25 minutes in the RAIN) to Bow Wow or whatever just to see what they were about and to kind of get a feel for what type of doggie day care this was and some general information.\n\nNot only when I came in dripping wet from the rain there wasn't anyone up front to greet me. She brushed me and my dog off when I asked her about more information. She had an attitude with me didn't really care to go in depth with me about anything. It was kind of \""We do this we do that\"" I ultimately ended up walking out on her mid-sentence. Complete waste of time. I don't usually write negative reviews but geeze if you treat animals better than you treat people fine but I at least deserve some respect.\n\nHer overall attitude was \""I don't even know you I don't even care to know you unless you want to pay for our services.\"" If that's the attitude you want to have I'll pass."
"2","No one is better at anthropomorphizing their pet than I am.  No one.  I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats, I wake up at absurd hours in the morning during the summer so his walk isn't too hot, and he has this crazy dog seat/throne in the back seat of my car so he can look out the window.  You've all heard of helicopter parenting, yeah?  It's a mess and screwing up today's children, but I'm totally guilty of helicopter doggie parenting.\n\nAll of which is to say that I'm not going to drop Gus off at some random place while I go to work.  \n\nStep 1 (which I think the other reviewer skipped/missed): call them and make an appointment.  Taking a strange dog into a place full of dogs is a little dicey.  Typically, new dogs are brought over on Saturday (when there are no other dogs around) so Barbara can get a sense of its temperament.  Barbara is great with dogs and has a ton of experience, but I totally had the, \""well, if my kid isn't good enough for them, screw them!\"" thoughts running through my head.  Obviously, Barbara instantly saw the inherent awesomeness of Gus.\n\nStep 2: learn to let go.  I don't have kids, but I imagine this is pretty much the same as dropping them off at daycare.  The first few times, they scream and cry when you leave and you're left feeling like a terrible person for the rest of the day.  Then one day, magically, they're excited to go to daycare (or Bow WoW) and they don't even look back while they're led away to the playroom.  It's a bittersweet moment, but one can't help but feel a little proud.  See what I mean about the anthropomorphizing thing?\n\nBow Wow separates the dogs by size and organizes the day into blocks of play, rest, and exercise so the dogs don't get overstimulated, which can cause stress.  The staff is excellent about communicating with owners about even minor changes in your dog's behavior and simply giving you updates about how your dog's socialization and adjustment.  I think I spent the first 2-3 weeks asking, \""Is he playing?  Is he making friends?\"" on a daily basis.  The entire staff was very good about humoring me.\n\nGus loves it there (his radar triggers around 21st street and he starts to flip out in the car) and I feel safe about leaving him there.  And honestly, when it comes to a doggie day care, that's all that matters."
"2","This is a fantastic hotel.  I went to a convention here at the end of June and loved the setting.  The convention center is well setup and the link between the hotel and the convention center works really well, especially if it's raining.\n\nMy only complaint is that the elevators are slow during busy times."
"1","When I think of Westins, I think of business-classy, nice and modern. This hotel has a classic feel to it, but definitely not very updated. Unfortunately, it reminds me of the staid-ness of Pittsburgh too much.\n\nThe check-in desk was super slow during my stay there. I do like the fact that there's a Fish Market downstairs. I don't like the fact that it's the convention center hotel, so it can get pretty crowded. That said, it's within walking distance to the Strip, and Downtown, so you can't deny the convenience. Still, I think there are newer hotels that provide the same."
"1","Location is ok for the downtown area. Not too impressed though, and won't be in my top 3 choices for the future. \n\nHere's my list: \nPro's: \nLocation \nSelf-Park at the Greyhound Bus garage a block down the street (anywhere from $5-$13/day depending on weekday or weekend) \nWalkable to all sporting venues \nGreat restaurant across the street NOT associated with the hotel (Tonic) \nFantastic gym and indoor pool \n\nCon's: \nRack rate='spensive \nSelf park at hotel is $20/day, ouch, w/ no in and out \nRoom had a stink that didn't go away \nMaids like to knock to clean the rooms starting at 8 AM, and do so multiple times if you don't put the privacy sign out \nHotel staff not particularly nice as what you'd expect out of a Westin \nThe Fish Market (restaurant in the hotel) super 'spensive w/o great snack offerings, and again, not so nice service \nWalls are super thin- so much so that we had morning wakeup calls from our \""neighbor\"" hitting the head, gross \nBeing colocated with the convention center means lots of traffic around the hotel and lots of obnoxious people \n~~~~~ \nIs now when I mention that we got the place for $70/night on Priceline (4 star, you'll either get this or the Omni)? If you can deal with the above, then this is your place...if not, pay the rack rate somewhere else."
"2","Great location, close to the convention center and many fine restaurants in the Strip District. Love the Heavenly beds and the shower with multiple heads. Spacious, clean & attractive rooms. \n\nLoses a star because the free internet is slow as hell, clearly to entice you to pay for faster speeds. Ugh. If I'm on a business trip, I want to be able to work in my room, and having to pay extra for the privilege of working efficiently is not cool."
"2","I stayed at this hotel while attending a convention in Pittsburgh. This is probably the best choice for accommodations if you have to go to the convention center a lot since there is an air-conditioned pedestrian bridge link between the hotel and convention center.\n\nI thought the room and beds were comfortable. I wasn't so fond of the cutesy leaf-shaped soap in the bathroom. I didn't like that you have to put your keycard in a slot in the wall to turn on the power in the room. Sure, it saves some electricity (and saves the hotel some money too, I'll bet), but that means you come back to a hot room every time. We ended up leaving a piece of cardboard in the slot.\n\nParking is expensive. The hotel used to offer discount cards to bring the garage parking rate down to $10/day but they stopped doing that this year because of a change in parking garage management. So it's $20/day. Ouch! I parked at the Grant Street Transportation Center for $13/day weekdays and $5/day weekend. It's not bad but still less convenient than if I could park in the parking garage immediately under the hotel.\n\nElevators are slow and the escalators between the lobby and function room floors kept breaking down. However, I'd cut them some slack here because the infrastructure is not built for 4000+ people hanging around the hotel.\n\nAll those problems aside, I thought service was good and this hotel has a good location with walking access to lots of restaurants."
"2","Overall a solid hotel, I've stayed here 4 of the last 5 weeks so I have a decent sample size.\n\nPros:\n- BEST gym in any hotel I've ever stayed (100lb dumbbells anyone?)\n- As SPG Platinum, always a high floor or great upgrade, even when busy\n- Consistently clean throughout\n- Visiting sports teams stay here if you're into celeb spotting\n- Check-in staff is friendly\n- Location is great, access to both strip and downtown\n- Option for 500 pts instead of room cleaning\n\nCons:\n- Tough to get a reservation sometimes and they don't cut breaks to regulars (not at discounted rates anyway)\n- Restaurant is ok at best\n- Can be some bizarre crowds depending on convention (http://www.anthrocon.org/ - I'm not hating, but it's unusual)"
"2","The hotel is kept clean and the room rates were very good.  The service from the staff was excellent.  Interestingly enough the restaurant in the hotel has the best sushi in Pittsburgh."
"2","The Westin  convention Center is located downtown of Pittsburgh. I reserved a city sky view room on the 18th Floor with twin beds. I got a perfect beautiful view of the city from my windows. The room was clean with a large LCD TV, but the sink is inside the bathroom. If someone inside the bathroom, I can't brush or wash my face. I hardly got any sleep at night from the loud clinking plumbing sound from the next door usage of the bathroom. addional indoor Parking cost $19"
"2","I've stayed at this Westin a few days a week for about a month. While technically located downtown, it's more on the outskirts of downtown (just based on my observations). It is connected to the convention center but I've never been inside so I can't give an opinion on it.\n\nMy overall experience at the Westin has been positive. There is no 'Wow' factor but the gym is incredibly nice (but close at 10pm). The rooms are standard with all the normal Westin perks, such as a bathrobe, dual shower heads, and heavenly beds. There is an option for free slooooow internet but platinum members get internet for free (yay?). \n\nI hadn't noticed at first but after someone pointed it out, you'll notice there is an odor in the halls and rooms. It isn't very noticeable but its there."
"2","Stayed here for a convention next door, mostly bc it was the most convenient. If I had realized how small DT Pittsburgh was I probably wouldve shopped around a little bit to save some $$$. This place was totally close to lots of things -- the river, the football and baseball stadiums, etc.\n\nBut anyways, had a good two-nite stay.  Clean and quiet rooms, friendly staff (tho I really got the impression that all Pittsburghians are just naturally super friendly.. at least compared to Angelenos). I happen to like that they are making cool environmentally-friendly efforts to save water, power, etc.  Others reviews mentioned it was a hassle to come home to a hot/cold/dark room, but I got two keys at check in (one to keep w/ me, one for the light-switch thing that runs the lights and ventilation). Easy. Problem solved. There wasnt a fridge in the room, but I requested one and someone brought it up within 15 minutes.\n\nThe internet was suuuuuper sloooow. And out of the 30 channels on the TV I think ~12 of them were sports. Ohs wells."
"2","Nice hotel.  Check-in was extremely smooth and quick.  Hotel is very clean.  Room is nice.  Shower drain kind of sucks but I can deal with that."
"2","We stayed here for pleasure, not business and it was great. We had the Astros staying at our hotel (what's up Brett Myers and J Happ?) so it's got to be pretty classy, right? Parking was expensive. If you self-park in the garage, you don't have in-out privileges and valet is $22/night. But that's the price you pay for staying in the city I guess. We were able to walk to PNC Park as well as other shops/restaurants in the theater district. Staff was great, rooms were clean and our view of the river was beautiful. \n\nMy only complaint was our neighbor's shower let off a high pitched, very loud whine when it was turned on. It woke us both up early. We were able to get back to sleep and we heard them fixing it later in the afternoon but it was annoying at the time.\n\nOther than that, I would stay here again. We got a great deal."
"2","It's been about five years since I stayed at the Westin, and what I remember -- other than that the words of Annie Dillard were scrolling on the roof all night -- is that when I asked at the front desk for help finding a souvenir, Monica went to a flabbergasting amount of trouble (on her own personal time!) to hook me up.\n\nSo it's like this. My name is Ben. The name of the Steelers' quarterback (beloved perhaps even more in 2007 than he is today) is also Ben. As a result, there seemed to be a lot of not-quite-trademark-infringement merchandise in the Steel City, and much of it had my name all over it.\n\nBut I couldn't find a \""Ben At Work\"" sign, try as I might. I asked Monica, who was working at the front desk, if she could help me figure out where to buy one. I figured she'd just tell me if she happened to have a few suggestions.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nWhen I saw her that evening, Monica had walked up to the Strip District to canvas all the tchotchkie-mongers and tourist traps. She had come up empty-handed. I was astonished that she had gone to such trouble, but I accepted that there were no Ben At Work signs for sale between the Allegheny and the Monongahela.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nUndaunted by such silly little things as the complete and total nonexistence of the desired merchandise on store shelves, Monica got creative. She remembered having given a magnetic \""Ben At Work\"" sign to a friend and called that friend up to ask whether she might be able to get it back.  The friend said \""Oh, that? I gave it to my mom.\""\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nThat's when Monica called up her friend's mom out of the blue and asked if she still had the sign, and whether it had any sentimental value. No, it doesn't, why do you ask? Well, you see, a guest at my hotel asked if I...\n\nNext time I saw Monica, she had (after finishing her shift at the most popular convention hotel in the city) driven across town to the house of a friend's mom to retrieve the precious artifact.\n\nHere's a photo of her handing it to me. http://j.mp/BenAtWork\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her what she had once paid at the store, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her for the gas she'd burned driving across town, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nI assume, based on the letter I wrote to the hotel's general manager and copied to corporate (back in November 2007), that she has since been promoted far higher than the front desk. But it wouldn't surprise me a bit if I found out that she had declined to be promoted to a position where she couldn't surprise and delight her customers.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge."
"1","Just stayed there for a wedding...room was ok, but the toilet was very noisy...when I opened the tank to see if I could make it quieter it looks like the fill valve hadn't been changed in 10 years.\nThey have an \""Eco\"" thing where you can decline having your sheets changed and in exchange you get a $5 voucher to use at the food and beverage sites at the hotel...warning...you can't use it on alcohol but they don't tell you that...I learned that when the bartender told me.  Rather than telling me that, he should have said \""I am not supposed to take this, but I will for you\"" then take the $5 out of his tip jar...I would have tipped him the $5 back for good customer service.  Instead he left a bad taste in my mouth and now I am Yelping about it.\nOne more thing about the $5 incentive...I didn't realize that meant that housekeeping would not visit the room at all and we were left without new coffee cups and coffee and \""glasses\"" (which are cheap cheap cheap plastic cups).  I think for the price of the room and their \""Eco\"" programs, they would be able to put a few glass glasses in the room.\nGood location and an easy walk to other restaurants, bars , hotels and sites.\nParking was kinda pricey but not unreasonable for  downtown in a major city."
"1","Beautiful rooms, excellent meeting spaces. The beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing. \n\nHowever, the customer service lacks excellence and the WiFi is completely unreliable."
"1","Marginal at best for the money. The whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other Westin properties I have stayed at."
"2","Conveniently located next to the Convention and Conference Center in the heart of downtown. Great furnishing and modern up-to-date amenities one would expect at a Westin property. Big full head rainfall shower and comfy pillow and mattresses to relax after a long day"
"1","completely worthless wifi."
"1","Facilities are very nice, beds are a little small for a couple.  At six am on 3/21/14 the neighboring room's alarm (1106) went off and cut right through the wall waking everyone up. I called the front desk at six thirty asking them to send someone to stop it, she said they would have to \""involve security\"". 8am now and it is still going full blast uninterrupted. Great start to a vacation courtesy of Weston."
"1","We always stay in Westin Hotels. We are Starwood Preferred guests. We have NEVER had any problems or complaints. We have stayed in Westin Hotels all over the country. But this place is downright disgusting.  Where to start.... No fitted sheets on the beds? Have to call to unlock my mini fridge? The \""green energy saving\"" light switches? The TV movies didn't work? The place is just dirty. From the vents, to the phones, the outlets and light switches, no trash can liners, and the lack of towels. We kept having to call for towels. OH and the house keeping! We left two times during the day and asked them to come clean our room BOTH of those times. We came back the second time and it wasn't cleaned? I called down to complain and told them to send someone in an hour because we were going to nap. Two seconds later, they come to want to clean? I was furious. We were excited that they had an indoor pool and hot tub. I wouldn't step foot in that hot tub ever again. Unless you want to catch a disease. So gross. Paint chipping off inside. The pool is strictly a lap pool. And the women's locker room was nasty. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month. I'm only giving this hotel 1 star because you can't give them zero. The only plus was the shuttle service and driver. Don't stay here, save your money."
"1","After looking at the hotel online I was excited, the pictures looked new and very nice. I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \""conservative\"" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \""The system is temporarily unavailable.\"" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \""new\"" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \""incidentals\"" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel."
"1","This is my 2nd stay here and since I had to unload my car at the valet and bring my own 5 suitcases to my room on a valet car I am already disappointed in the service. I actually had to get on the elevator with my own luggage with other people with this big cart. Disappointed that the Fairmont had no vacancies. Ditch this hotel."
"1","Valet lost my car keys and have been incredibly unprofessional! Completely unacceptable and I would warn everyone about using valet services here. Disgusted."
"1","OK, here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters. Where I'm from, you can't call your restaurant an \""Oyster House\"" without raw oysters served, unless you want a good ass whoopin'. \n\nNothing else about this place remotely conveys \""Oyster House.\"" It's a fried seafood joint, that doesn't serve Yuengling nor takes credit cards. We got all of our food on Styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. The \""waitress\"" stood and watched us eat most of the meal. This particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.  It was unsettling. You also have to pay before being served. \n\nThe New England Clam Chowder was good."
"2","I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \""Oyster\"" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better Pittsburgh lunch- not even Primanti's."
"1","Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap."
"1","Awesome chowder but that's it..."
"1","Horrible, go to Long John Silver's. I hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap ."
"2","If this place could be described in four words, they would be:\n\nAngry, Sweaty, Dive-y, and DELICIOUS\n\nThis place is a Pittsburgh classic. Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome.\n\nThe cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way (if that makes any sense whatsoever). Their no-nonsense, \""soup-nazi\"" style fits with the classic blue-collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine.\n\nBottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, \""Voted Best Fish in Town.\"" I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town."
"1","I have only ever been to Market Square once before, so I was excited to find myself here again! Darren suggested the Original Oyster House for our afternoon meal. Mmmm seafood! I could go for some good seafood, especially fresh oysters! Now, I am from an area not far from the ocean, and every year we had a community oyster roast, you know: fried, steamed, and raw oysters. \n\nUmmm, yeah. Big let down. I should know better than to have high expectations. If I wanted Long John Silvers, or better still Captain D's (look it up if you never heard of Captain D's), then I'd hit up one up, AND get a friendlier server to boot. I also bet I could get into a ladies room without needing a key elsewhere, or even some SWEET N LOW for my tea! Sorry...the more I write the angrier I am getting. One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.\n\nOk, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok. At least they weren't too greasy. And the frigg'n \""original oyster\""... WHERE IS THE OYSTER??? Nothing but breading. I think I saw something resembling an oyster in there somewhere. And every entree had to be fried. Ugh."
"2","Walked in here xmas eve after primanti bros stopped serving out of the blue, despite us sitting at a table. Place is a total dive but that's part of it's charm. Fried fish between bread. Load up the hot sauce and tartar sauce, get some fried oysters and onion rings, and expect exactly what you ordered. This isn't le bernadin in nyc. Some of these reviews seem like they were expecting fine dining. CASH ONLY."
"1","Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler.. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways, hubby got a deep fried cod filet that was sandwiched between 2 hamburger buns, which was pretty decent fried fish while it was hot and crispy... But my crab cake was sadly unforgivable."
"1","My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. \n\nThe place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. \n\nMy mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!\n\n I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.\n\nI understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!"
"1","Everything about this place seems very antiquated.  I wasn't impressed with my clam chowder.  There was some kind of bread component inside the clam chowder that may have been an attempt at dumplings but just tasted like soggy bread.  \n\nI'm not a fan"
"1","We stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply.  However, they have several cooked selections. That said, we only stopped into this location for a drink and then moved on.\n\nThe restaurant includes outdoor seating and a long straight bar that extends from the front of the restaurant to the rear.  Overall, the interior isn't spectacular, but has several nostalgic photos of famous people (both local and national), some of the photos autographed.\n\nTheir drink selection is simple with many local brews and mass produced American beers."
"1","Had lunch here at the OOH on a cold day in early Spring. It was a Wednesday, and thankfully not a Friday in Lent where it would have been much busier.\n\nI opted for the dual crabcakes platter with two sides, and the crabcake was mushy, not fried long enough, and just lacking any reasonable portion of crab meat.\n\nI've had the fried oysters before, and they were pretty good.  I think your results might be highly dependent on what you order.\n\nThis lunch kinda sucked."
"1","A native all my life and  never been, finally went last summer. I felt it was the thing to do. I did not like squeezing in that miniscule bar and eating on a table the size of a frisbee. Look, I love food, and rarely complain, but I feel I have to be honest. Like one guy said, they don't really need our kudos now, as they are there and will remain there. Just like Primanti's and Isaly's,,,,oh wait, haha. The food was passable but could be better. the Oysters were good, and if ever I do go back I will get just them because the crab cakes sucked. Sure, I am spoiled by the east coast cakes I have had in Jersey and Baltimore. And that is the only thumbs up Ballymore will ever get from me!OOH, trendy hotspot you should take visitors to, fill them with cold Irons and fried sea fare, then take them home and they can say they have been there."
"2","The good: I'll eat anything they want to batter and fry up, all the fried food was steaming, crispy, flavorful, tender, and delicious. Portions are large, I got the \""fish nuggets\"", I expected tiny nibbles but was pleasantly surprised by prepared mountains of battered fish the size of my fists.\n\nPrices are extremely reasonable, my wife and I happily stuffed ourselves and got drinks for under $30.   The prices are good anywhere, but especially for  the prime downtown hot spot of market square.  The Oyster House is Pittsburgh's oldest bar and restaurant, and has been featured in several movies over the years.  They have lots of vintage photos hanging on the wall.  The staff is gruff, but friendly, true Pittsburghers.\n\nThe bad: As I mentioned, it was founded in 1870, and it doesn't appear to have been updated since, it felt run down. The atmosphere is lacking, they serve you with paper plates and plastic utensils.  Anything not fried was mediocre.  The crab cakes and deviled crab were oversalted.  They don't serve Heinz Ketchup which seems wrong given both their historical heritage and that they are located about 100 feet away from the Heinz Global HQ in PPG.\n\nWould I go back to the Original Oyster?  Sure!  Great portions, low prices, tasty food.  I want to try the \""Monster Fish Sandwich\"" which is supposedly Moby Dick sized (eat it before it eats you!)  But if you're looking for a high end experience with classy atmosphere, this isn't the place.  It's a good bar with good bar food, go in with the right expectations and you'll be well satisfied."
"1","I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me."
"1","This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!"
"1","TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \""Original Oyster House\"" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \""first restaurant\"" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \""historical landmark.\"" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place."
"1","The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot."
"1","We were excited to try the Original Oyster House given its history and nice outdoor seating in market square. We were prepared for foam plates and cash only, which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters, famous fried fish, beer-battered fish nuggets, and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried, much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server, but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood."
"2","I love the food here and on a nice day, there is nothing better than eating it outdoors. The combos are great. On my last visit I had the oversized fish sandwich. It was good, but the bun was dry and stale. I wish I'd ordered the oyster sandwich, but next time. They have great slaw and fries and the staff were very friendly and accomodating. Love it!"
"1","Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink, another 15 minutes to get a menu after asking for one. Annoying wait, they need to hire more people"
"1","Well I went here with my friends and my 3 year old daughter for a dinner. I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to food,it's so so,I've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was ok,she checked on us maybe twice,the only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my wallet,good thing I remember my debit card pin,made a withdrawal,paid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but hey,it's part of operating a business. The food was ok but it's not memorable."
"2","I stopped in for lunch and it was busy-- about 15-20min wait from the time I walked in till I got my order, but let me tell you, it was worth the wait. I had the oyster sandwich, clam chowder, and calamari. The oysters were very tender and I only wished the sandwich had a few more on it, cuz it wasn't very filling. Good thing I had the soup & calamari.. The clam chowder was sinfully delicious, with a heavy cream base and tons of flavor. The calamari was okay, nothing to brag about, but the sandwich and chowder couldn't have been better. \nThe oyster House is split up into two different restaurants next-door to each other.. To the right side is a sitdown restaurant with a bar and the left side is a casual quick stop shop with a counter to order at (which is where I chose to go). The interior is a bit dark & outdated and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere, but the outdoor tables in Market Square are a great option, weather permitting."
"1","Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup."
"1","This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie. \n\nOne slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza. \n\nAvoid."
"1","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time."
"1","This place is awful.  The pizza is not good, but what is worse is the people who run the place.  They screwed up my order and refused to fix it.  I told them I was going to throw it away and order from somewhere else.  And I did.  Its really too bad, they are super close to my apartment. If they would've just been nice and switched it, I'd probably order from them again just based on that alone."
"1","Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever."
"1","I am really disturbed, tonight I ordered crab ravioli and I have kind of a special cheese culture allergy. Creams totally fine in small doses milk is too) so I ordered to the ravioli and said please no cheese it'll make me very sick.\""\n \""If there's no way to order this without just call me and I'll change my order.\"" \n\nThe pasta came smelling an awful lot like mozzarella) so I called and asked if the guy could check if the order had accidentally had cheese put in it. I mean I get things happen! \""\n\nThe gentleman told me he didn't know what was in the food and I should look it up online.\"" Then he proceeded to say if I was worried I should have someone taste it and snorted when I said I was dining alone. I'm upset and offended. I run my own business... and promote local business's constantly. I will be very sure to let everyone know this Pizza Parma.. believes the customer is not only not right, but their health doesn't matter.  What a bummer. I used to be a big fan."
"1","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude."
"1","Good for a fast lunch. Had the gyro and added feta. Gyro was fine. Bottle of coke had icy slush in it."
"2","Friendly service, good food and cozy atmosphere. Open late so best place to stop by and get some delicious snacks. 20\"" hoagie is the bomb:)"
"1","Update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best.  So disappointing, we loved it the first time!  My guess is that if you get pizza right out of the oven you're good to go - otherwise, you're SOL."
"2","Strolling through Pridefest the other day we became very hungry. It was hot and crowded and we wanted to strand away from the main event for a little and get a good slice of pizza for a good price.\n\nThe atmopshere is very \""dive-y pizza joint-y.\"" Nothing wrong with that because I come from the beliefs that the divey-er the better! (Nobody makes chicken fingers and fries like a greasy bar!) There are some tables for sit-in, but nothing is top of the line. It was comfortable to get away from the crowds and escape the heat for a little with only one other table dining inside as well. \n\nI got the lunch deal which was a personal pan pizza (one topping of your choice) and a bottle of pop for about $7-$8. Not bad! The pizza tasted great, was at a good temperature and had that good amount of grease that I was anticipating from a downtown pizza shop. \n\nService was great as well! The man working the counter acknowledged us from the moment we walked through the door and was nothing but kind. He answered all of our questions and was very polite."
"1","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \""the best pizza in the city.\""  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow."
"1","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me"
"2","Pizza is delicious chicken ranchero is one of the best pizzas i have ever had and they have a deal where u get xl specialty pizza with free sub or wings deff a must try"
"2","I got delivery and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it was over done for my liking and colder than I expected. It still tasted good so I popped it in the oven and that helped enough to be able to enjoy it. They forgot my drink when they made the delivery but the driver went back and got my drink and returned in under 10 minutes. That alone is why I'm giving it 4 stars because being a delivery driver myself in the past, I understand how easy it can be to forget something small and when you're really busy so it's hard to be quick with bringing the missing items while keeping up with other orders. I will definitely order again just because of the service from their driver."
"2","I feel like Pizza Parma is a prime example of \""don't judge a book by its cover.\"" When you walk by Pizza Parma while downtown, it's pretty easy to write it off, especially when there's so many fine dining options in the area now. It doesn't help that the place tends to be pretty empty, at least from what I've observed - a lack of visible patrons definitely can keep people away. But today I decided to give them a shot, because I really didn't want to stop in anywhere for a big meal - I just wanted a cheap piece of pizza.\n\nThough the place does have a \""dive-y\"" feel to it, it did look very clean and had a welcoming atmosphere once I ventured on in. The tables and chairs - which were mostly the elevated and interconnected kind - admittedly looked a little worn down, but they weren't gross or anything like that. Since I knew I'd likely be eating in a few hours I opted to just eat a plain piece of cheese pizza to hold me over. One piece of cheese pizza and one bottle of Dr. Pepper to go with it cost me $4.25 - not bad, in my opinion. And while not fancy by any means the pizza was pretty tasty; it had the right blend of cheese and pizza and the sauce was very flavorful. It was exactly what you'd want when enjoying a plain ol' piece of pizza.\n\nI'll definitely keep this place's super quick service, relatively cheap prices and impressive portion sizes in mind from now on - it's good to know that there are places you can get into while downtown like this, and from what I'm hearing/reading it's worth exploring the menu and eating something other than pizza here. I admit, however, that I may get some food to go next time if I can, as the old elevated and connected chairs and tables in here sounded like they wanted to break apart at any moment...maybe it's time to update them. After all, \""Dive-y\"" doesn't necessarily have to mean \""falling apart,\"" right?"
"1","If you can find the place... Avoid it.\n\nIt's a tiny hole in the wall of a bar; which is acceptable, considering I live in Chicago and tight bars are our specialty.  I went with friends to see our friend Lola perform in her drag show of the evening.  It was fun enough as money and props flew around the bar's open floor 'stage' area.\n\nHad it not been for the somewhat under attentive bartenders and the overwhelming amount of cigarette smoke I would have had myself a fantastic time.\n\nNot being a smoker and living in a city where smoking is prohibited in bar and within 15 feet of a public building; I must say... It made me appreciate the Chicago law even more so.  If I were management; I'd figure out how to give your smokers appropriate areas to enjoy their death sticks, away from those of us who'd rather not die as a result of their desire to do so.\n\nIf you're looking for a good night out, somewhere you can let loose and enjoy yourself... You may want to venture somewhere else."
"2","A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high points. The bathrooms stick out in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well be in a different building. And they may be."
"2","All the way at the far end of the Strip we finally found the best bar in the neighborhood (admittedly out of only a handful that exist).\n\nThis place was charmingly well worn around the edges, but it's mostly a standard American-Irish pub, with all the familiar bric-a-brac and beer taps.  I have to object strenuously to a few of the drinks on the menu.  First, there is a \""Dark Bomb\""--Guinness and Jagermeister.  Then there is an \""Irish Pancake\""--Guinness and butterscotch schnapps.  And finally there is the \""Irish Hoe\""--half Guinness, half Hoegaarden.  These are crimes against nature.  I can't vouch for the last one, but the first two were terrible (of course I had to try them).  Jagermeister has no business within ten feet of Guinness, and the Pancake would have been okay if they halved the amount of butterscotch.  \n\nThis month's featured beer is Red Stripe--get five bottles for $15.  The pints have some odd prices:  $5.61 for Guinness and Newcastle and $4.68 for Sam Adams.\n\nThey had some live music (a guy with a wee guitar singing eclectic covers) which was decent and ended at 1am.  We were the last patrons before closing at 2, and despite them sweeping and putting up chairs, nobody ever chased us out or even looked at us askance."
"1","Horrible staff! Terrible attitude and we could tell didn't want to be there.  Screwed up our bill and was visible aggravated and angry when we questioned charges.  This awful service makes us never want to return."
"1","Have you guys been here in the daylight? This place is filthy! \nI understand this place is old, but wash the curtains (they look like they've been in a flood) and those glass lamps hanging from the ceiling. The woodwork and floor are sticky. \nWe had a Guinness (in the wrong glass I must add) and didn't have the stomach to eat anything. \nAll this place needs is a good wash. Let me know when, we'll go back."
"2","Excellent atmosphere and friendly service.   Food was great."
"1","For the first time in my life, I sent my meal back to the kitchen. The Corn Beef in the Corn Beef and Cabbage tasted really bad and felt like I was chewing gum. Avoid that plate at all costs"
"2","This is the most authentic Irish Pub you will find.   The food is good and plentiful and the beer selection is impressive.  I have been several times to the Ceili  dances on Tuesday night, they are a lot of fun, and the regulars are great about reaching out to teach newcomers. There's lots of live music, and a truly Irish ambiance."
"1","This place is a blast on St Patricks Day, and to see a band play.  It gets packed.  Mullaneys has been around for a long time -- possibly the oldest Irish pub I'm aware of.  It's never changed.  I love coming here--for beer and whiskey.\n\nToday I came here for lunch.  I'd never had the food before.  It was just okay.  I ordered the crab caprese salad and you dont get very much for what it cost, and the server was charming and Irish, but the service was incredibly slow.  It took an hour and a half for lunch.\n\nI think I'll only come here for drinking and fun, as a dining destination youve got so many other options in the Strip District!\n\n...also, while I dont want the bar to change, it is looking incredibly worn.  Its in dire need of new paint and new flooring, lest it become a dive bar.\n\nTWO STARS BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS DIRTY.  Its very dirty.  So dirty.  Maybe they  dont notice it at night during the bulk of their business.  Inch of dusk on the window sill.  So gross.  Please, please clean the bar."
"1","There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said \""Open\"" and the door was open.  I guess I was supposed to know that it was closed.  But all I got was two people screaming in my ear that it was closed like I barely understood or something.  So much for customer service.  Needless to say, I probably won't be back."
"1","This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant but our food took about 45 minutes to come, and the quality of the food wasn't that great.  You can definitely get better Vietnamese elsewhere in the city.\n\nWith all the wonderful dining options in the Strip, I'm confused as to how this place survives."
"1","Uggh.  I wanted pho really bad, but theirs tastes like warm ramen broth with 4 little pieces of meat in it.  Got the fried spring rolls, too, and they charged $5-6 for four little rolls that were obviously prepackaged frozen spring rolls.\n\nI gotta stop trying out restaurants without checking Yelp first, because everyone else is dead on.  Avoid this place unless you're in the Strip and absolutely have to have some Vietnamese (and don't care too much about quality)."
"1","So here's my story, I went into  this branch of Burlington Coat factory on a Saturday morning when I was in town for a conference. It was 10:15 and I had to be at a panel at 10:30 (so I was in a hurry). I needed to get a pair of jeans because  the ones I had packed were damaged. I found what I was looking for and as I left the dressing room (wearing the item-which I have done at other stores--with no problem), I told the woman that I would pay at the register (keep in mind that I am the only person in the store). \n\nSHE WAS AGAST! She couldn't believe that I said that. She said that I absolutely had to pay for the jeans before I could wear them. Keep in mind that I've been on travel and had to wear clothes out of the store before and have paid for them and HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS.\n\nI FEEL LIKE SHE TREATED ME LIKE A CRIMINAL. I was deeply \ninsulted. \n\nI remember now why I don't go to Burlington Coat Factory."
"2","I love this store. It is always busy and it is kinda ghetto but on a positive note the layout of the store is pretty ok because I still find amazing deals.:)"
"2","I. Love. Burlington! \n\nI love the deals and their stylish clothes on the low (!) &  how you can go in looking for anything from a hair accessory to a new set of bakeware and they'll have it!\n\nYesterday I bought a lunch tote that was $7.. i searched reviews for it on Amazon and it was listed at $25.. on Amazon which already knocks off prices.. Seriously a steal!\n\nThey even have Pirate shirts. I went in to look for one before a game & they're cheaper than I can find from the street vendors. (no sense in paying $20 for a shirt i most likely wont wear outside PNC park)\n\nYes, it does have some off the rocker customers, but you'll have that downtown at an off-price store.."
"1","I used to really like this place, but the service can't be overlooked anymore.  I ate here recently on a monday afternoon (granted it's not the A team on Monday's), but  it was so obvious the staff just wanted to get us out of there so they could go back to reading star magazine.  The food was good, not great but good enough.  The service as mentioned was poor.  The server was apathetic at best.  He didn't give us time to finish our soup before he had our entree's in front of us and a check on the table.  I think this was my last visit."
"1","This place does decent Thai food, but is nothing special. There was nothing memorable or notable about my meal. The service was decent. This is one of few places in downtown Pittsburgh where a vegan can go and be reasonably accommodated."
"1","This was the single worst Thai meal I have ever had in my life.\n\nI went here for dinner with some friends after going to the PSO, since they were open relatively late at night.  This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.\n\nThe first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup, which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone, with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence, but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem, with dirt still clinging to it.\n\nMy companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable, but not exciting -- again, although it claimed to be lemongrassy, there was no lemongrass flavor to be had, and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.\n\nI got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu, the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again, the broth was lacking in overall flavor, as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.\n\nTo top it off, the service wasn't that great, and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.  We will not be back."
"2","The food is the reason to go. Lunch specials are a great deal- about 9-10 bucks for lemongrass soup (spicy broth with cilantro, mushrooms and tomatoes), a spring roll and entree. I would recommend either the red or green curry as both are spicy, flavorful and contain meat and tons of fresh veggies. The pad thai is decent and for those that do not like thai food, there is a chinese menu on the back that my friends contend has been general tso's than the authentic chinese places close by."
"1","terrible service is right.  the minute my coworker and i walked in, the host (i think the teenage son of the owner?) was just rude.  he was going to give us the table closest to the register where people are always walking in and out.  my coworker asked to be seated at one of the other 8 tables that were open.  he mumbled something, but then let us grab another table.  and when he served the dishes he pretty much was throwing them onto the table.\n\nthe wonton soup was horrible.  the wonton itself was pretty much all dough (not even cooked all the way thru) and i don't even want to speculate what the tiny meat in it was made of.  i've also tried the house soup which is just water with tomotoes in it.  for my entree i had the green curry w/chicken, which actually wasn't as bad as the service but that's not saying much at all.\n\nsad that this is one of the few places for asian food in the pitts..."
"1","Had dinner at Lemon Grass earlier this week. When I walked in the place was empty. Got to pick where I wanted to sit. First thing I noticed is the place was an absolute sauna. I asked my server about why it was so hot in the restaurant? She shrugged and did not seem interested.\n\nI ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms \""Tom Yum\"" and \""Som Tum\"" when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms.\n\nSoup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place. There was a lot more tomato chunks in their version of this soup than I've experienced before. I would not order this again.\n\nThen the Papaya salad came out - just ok - not spicy and bright like a good Papaya salad should be.\n\nWater glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty.\n\nWon't come back here again unless they do something about the lack of AC and better food!"
"1","Pass.  I tried Lemon Grass for takeout and was as disappointed as many of my fellow Yelpers here.  The Pad Thai was bland and generic, and tasted almost gummy.  The coconut lemon grass soup had slightly more flavor, but it left a really greasy feeling in my mouth.  \n\nTo top it all off, while I was waiting for my food, I had to endure being hit on by the host.  To be fair, it's not like they were all that busy, so I guess it gave him something to do.  And I wouldn't have minded if the food had been amazing.  But sadly, it wasn't.  And it wasn't cheap, either."
"1","Visiting Pittsburgh with my daughter, we wanted to eat somewhere downtown and not walk too far.  Yelped this place  and chose it because it was close by and not because of the rating.  But it turns out that generally you can trust your fellow yelpers on this one.  We were seated immediately because it wasn't too crowded (bad sign). We sat by the window.  The best thing about this restaurant is the decor, as it had a Thai motif on the wall, a glass case with little Thai statues, and a nice vase with a fake orchid on the table. nicely folded cloth napkin...etc,  I didn't experience the bad service that others claimed, but I can see how it might be possible because my service was quite mediocre.  Now segway to the food and I don't know how to explain this, as bad service or inadequate food, but we ordered the beef curry, and it came with NO BEEF in it.  Did they think they could get away with it and we wouldn't notice? I figured it was just an oversight , that maybe we just looked like vegetarians, because it's ridiculous for any restaurant to skimp on the food.  But then I got my chicken lemongrass soup. It was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it. I wanted a typical Thai soup called Tom Kha Gai but they never heard of it. But  please take a look at my photos and see how small the soup bowl is.  I placed the spoon on top for comparison and you will really see that the bowl is not much bigger than the spoon. Nuff said."
"1","Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him."
"1","This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow, and the food is awful. Everything pretty much looks and tastes the same. The waiter seemed annoyed that my eating partner complained that his soda was flat, and brought him another flat soda. When he complained again, the waiter told him to see the host on the way out.  If you are in the area, there are many better choices for a good meal, other than this place."
"1","Just had the panang tofu for lunch, and was crazy underwhelmed.  Tiny portion, very watery sauce, and just no *zing* at all to the flavor.  The wait staff was slammed by a half-full restaurant, so things like a coke took ten or fifteen minutes.\n\nThis trip was bad, even for the price."
"1","Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate you and your hapiness."
"1","Poor service, awful attitudes and sub-par food.  I could make the same food in my own kitchen ... Hope to see another Thai spot open downtown."
"1","Oh this place needs Gordon Ramsay, Friendly staff, but something is missing I don't know what? \n\nFood was ok, but not fab. I was a little disappointed with the Panang curry which didn't look like what I know it should look or tasted like. \n\nThai tea was no bueno."
"2","I looked over the other reviews and I don't get it.  Maybe they've suddenly gotten better.  I moved to Pittsburgh about four months ago, so I only have recent experience to go by, and I think this place is great.  Would they rate as well if they were in New York or San Francisco? Maybe not, but this is damned good Thai food.\n\nI've eaten outside (dinner) and gone for takeout - both were excellent.  I like really hot food and usually end up disappointed.  Some places just throw a bunch of pepper in so it taste's peppery rather than having heat.  Last night I got a red curry with chicken.  I told them \""Thai hot\"" and assured them that I knew what that meant and got a great (and very hot meal).\n\nI am a little baffled by the mix of Chinese with the Thai - I guess the Yinzers in Pittsburgh can't really tell one Asian cuisine from another"
"1","It was a beautiful day in Pittsburgh today - I had to get outside for a walk in the sunshine.  I thought I'd just wander around for Thai lunch and so I ended up at Lemon Grass.  I'll probably not be back.\n\nThere was just one table of 2 seated and eating when I arrived.  And, a table of 10 leaving and all paying separately.  All using a credit card.  I forgot to mention that the one waitress working is also the cashier.  So, it took quite a while to process this table's payments individually by card.  In moments like these, it's best to just get the one check for the whole table and take the 18% auto gratuity as a courtesy to the server.  (Sorry for the rant there...)\n\nAll that said, the huge table of 10 had left.  I was dining alone and there was just the other table of 2 in the restaurant.  I thought I would be able to get in and get out for lunch.  But, no such luck.  It took a while for the server to take my order.  The food came out quickly enough.  But it was quite underwhelming.  I settled with the Thai Fried Rice with beef.  There was a ton of Thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming.  I couldn't be sure if the basil was fresh which may be why the dish tasted a bit rancid to me.  My entree also came with a choice of soup and a small vegetarian egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  The soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour.\n\nI was a bit surprised considering that there were a whopping 3 diners in the restaurant that it took a while for the check to arrive and to get drink refills.  I had high hopes for this place but the food and service was just so disappointing.  The hunt continues for decent Asian food near my office in the Allegheny Center..."
"1","This restaurant has never been great, but if you wanted an Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an OK place to go. However, last night's dinner was just plain bad. I had beef salad, and it was some coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like the mix of sweet, sour, and spice that it should have. I also had tofu panang. It was also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise nondescript brown sauce with no spiciness."
"1","A very lovely name for a very terrible resturant. \n\nThe food is bland, bland bland. How this place can serve such flavorless food and stay open for years is beyond me. \n\nThe inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained. \n\nI decided  to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce. The sauce was slimy and the broccoli was water logged and over cooked.  As if it has set in a pot of luck warm water for hours before being served to me. \n\nI'm noticing a theme of horrible resturants on 6th Street and I don't like it."
"1","Don't waste your time or money. Rude service, and pizza was subpar.  So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners on quality of your product.   The bar looked small and quaint. ..maybe the beer is really cold or I just hit a bad day.  For pizza? Na ...won't be back! NEXT!!!"
"1","This Starbucks is worthy of mention only because it moved into the lobby of the former Plaza Theater.  The Plaza is where my friends and I (legally) first saw R-rated movies on our own.  I remember seeing \""Pulp Fiction\"" here.\n\nOtherwise, it's just a Starbucks."
"1","i go here because it's close and because i like sweetened iced coffee black.  also because i hate crazy mocha and there lack of making a simple sugar to sweeten iced drinks.  truthfully, i wouldn't go here if jeet was open at normal coffee hours.  why?  bad staff...well, one staff member in particular .the woman in front of me in line totally polite to her. me totally opposite. rude .big attitude and not even a thanks. i really don't care one way or the other about your sexuality but don't take it out on me because im a guy."
"1","I'm not a cool kid, and no youngun' would ever be impressed with how gnarly I am. (Kids still say that, right? Gnarly? Boss? I should give up, shouldn't I?) I've got no hipster cred to loose, so I can actually talk about frequenting Starbucks on several occasions. \n\nThe pros: \nIt's always clean inside which is nice. I don't think I've even noticed a straw out of place or napkin on the floor.\n\nThe drinks are exactly what one would expect from Starbucks. Somewhat generic, but the espresso gets the job done. I do stay away from the regular coffee as it tends to just taste burnt.\n\nIt's open early enough that I rarely find myself standing like a lost child outside the locked front door about to burst into tears because I can't get my caffeine fix.\n\nThe cons: \nIt's Starbucks, which means every single time I buy a coffee here and not at a local owned coffee shop.\n\nOne particular employee who just seems to choose to dislike customers by first glance and is absolutely rude to the point of refusing to acknowledge them standing there. I wouldn't ever go any further into who it is, but I feel it warrants being said on here.\n\nIf that employee would buck up, I'd rarely to never have a bad experience there which is saying a lot about a coffee place."
"1","I will start to say... The owner is not so much of a nice guy, the establishment could use some updating, the bathroom is Disgusting(!), Garfield is not an uplifting environment (women, do NOT walk alone here at night) those are the negatives offhand.  The good is that some obscure independent bands play here for a relatively inexpensive price, the sound is adequate the \""artwork\"" SUCKS! go see a show here & just be overwhelmingly WOWed!"
"2","This thrift store has a truly community friendly atmosphere. It is a smallish store and volunteers are always setting new items out from boxes newly donated. \n\nI have always gotten a good deal here in a time when \""thrift\"" stores can be overpriced for kitschy or unique items. A bag of books is always 1 dollar no matter how big or small the bag. There is also a furniture store next store which they need to show you into because it is often locked.\n\nGood place for cheap stuff."
"1","The staff was all very nice and it was a very laid-back place. It was quite small though. Good for clothing, but not really any furniture or large housewares items. A small area with dishes, glasses, etc and then electronics which was mostly VHS tapes and cassettes. They have a nice-sized children's area in the back with clothing and toys.\n\nThis seems like the kind of place you might find a gem occasionally, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here since there are a lot of other places with a much larger selection."
"2","No one has reviewed this little gem n a while, so I thought I would. My 14-year-old daughter introduced me to this place. She kept telling me about the clothing she could get there for less than $1, and I didn't believe her. So, I went with her. The store is on a stretch of Penn where you can still find a metered parking place right out front. For those not from the city or who aren't used to shopping in hoods in transition, don't let the look of nearby buildings scare you off. If the nice old ladies who volunteer at the shop find the area safe enough to work in, then you don't have anything to be afraid of. Buck up! You'll be glad you did.\n\nAbout the merchandise, it's worth searching through. The last time I was there, I got an authentic, mint-condition Burberry men's trench (with lining!) for $4.00. Yes, you read that right. $4.00. It fits my son perfectly!\n\nMy daughter is into 80s fashion right now (which is strange bc I was too in the 80s). She comes home with sweaters for .$25. 25 cents! for a sweater! Wacky.\n\nI bought a pair of mint condition (could have been brand new) jeans there once, too. I dug through a box of jeans to find them and can't remember how much I paid, but I am sure it was less than what I could get them for at Goodwill (less than $7). (BTW, I'm a huge fan of Goodwill, too.)\n\nThey do have a dressing room!"
"1","I ate china house for dinner. I had the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce combo that came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I substituted steamed rice for the fried rice. I also got wonton soup (small). The price was great! For all of that and a can if sprite I paid 10.17! And the service was prompt and the lady in the front was very pleasant! Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service. Hope I have better luck next time!"
"1","i just ate half of a cockroach.  Gross.  Never going here again."
"1","It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago: the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain-glass windows; the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine; the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon; and framed 80's posters of the same color scheme grace the walls. \n\nThe menu is marginally more updated than the decor. Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g., the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing). Overall, the menu is too long and rambling without a theme, covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean. \n\nThe food was unremarkable. The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette; it was served with olive oil and powdery parm (i.e., from the green can). For appetizers, we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches. They were probably the highlight of the meal, but the portions were tiny, and the ingredients were not the best. For the main course, I tried their fish taco, which was on the bland and dry side. \n\nSummary: if you are ever nostalgic for \""fine dining in a small American town during the 80's,\"" this place is for you."
"1","Every time I have been to Cafe Sam I have been very disappointed.  On my most recent visit, the waiter was overbearing, the menu confusing, and the food unremarkable.  Avoid this place."
"1","Gotta say, I'm not a fan of this place. The prices were very high for the quality of food. Not that the food was bad, but it wasn't great, and for the price it certainly wasn't good enough. The wait staff was nice, and was attentive, but would forget things and made our bill ( true it was a party of 10) a freaking nightmare. 2 waitresses recording their own bill, so two bills with everyone's items on both bills just randomly. Confusing, and a pain. The place it self is nice, but when the food isn't very good and way over priced, and the bar is SUPER over priced what's the point?"
"2","Cafe Sam has a cool Pittsburgh vibe. It's a bit funky but the food is good and interesting and their menu offers a lot of choices. I went with a group and we all had the Prix Fixe menu. It was a little bit pricey, but I think it was well worth it."
"2","Ate here yesterday for the first time.  Definitely a fan of the vibe - we sat up on the roof patio and it was like a garden oasis in the middle of the Baum/Center eyesore.  The decor managed to almost completely block out the view of Ritters and the UPMC parking lot next door - a major plus.  The inside was, as others have already commented, very pastel and outdated, reminding me of my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  Definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion, but then again there were quite a few old ladies there, so maybe they just know their crowd.  \n\nI'll cut to the chase: the food was GREAT.  For not super expensive, there were large quantities, many options, a very helpful waitress who helped us make some very difficult choices, and a clear willingness to tailor anything on the menu to suit our needs.  \n\nOne last thing about the service, which is what earns Cafe Sam its 5th star -- we were running late to see a play after dinner, which was our own poor planning.  But as soon as we alerted the waitress to the situation, she bent over backwards to get us our food as quickly as possible, take-out containers so we could finish on the road, and the check paid without delay.  It was definitely above and beyond the call of duty, and we wouldn't have made it on time without her help.\n\nGreat food, great service, weird but nice decor.  I'll definitely be back."
"1","Not great. Stale bread and the food was strongly over-flavored. I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another, and I said \""just a half glass\"" which I ask for all the time (and get). The reply from the waitress was \""we can't do that\"" and the same from the manager. CAN'T do that? Terrible attitude - more like WON'T do that. Well, I WON'T be going back"
"1","I came to Cafe Sam with high hopes.  Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu, we all decide on what we want and order:\n\nFrench Onion\nBuffalo Chicken Medallions \nFish Tacos with salsa and guacamole\nCheeseburger (medium) with apple sauce and potato salad\nSide of Fries\nWater and Iced Tea with Lemon\n\nBread with butter, olive oil infused with pumpkin, and our drinks soon arrive.  ALERT: The tea is flavored.  I really do dislike flavored teas, but I put extra lemon in mine to cover the foul taste and continued on.  The bread was slightly aged as the crust was somewhat hard.  The olive oil was fairly tasteless, but fresh.  I would never use a light olive oil for tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did.  While it was an interesting thought to add pumpkin seeds -- this is the current theme -- they didn't add that much to the oil.  At least the butter was soft rather than frozen.\n\nAs we planned work for the next next day, our Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived.  They need to remove the \""s\"" from Medallions as there was only piece.  In fact, they need to remove \""medallion\"" and \""buffalo\"" from the name and call it something else.  It was just a piece of chicken breast dredged in Cajun seasoning with a few stray strands of cheese melted on it.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad; but a better name would have been \""Cajun Chicken Breast\"" rather than what they call it now.  As I ate the chicken, the French Onion Soup arrived.  This crock of soup looked exceptionally good.  The cheese on top was browned to the proper point.  I took the spoon and cut in with a voraciousness as I could taste it already.  When I put the first bite in my mouth though, the flavor was flat.  I took another bite and it was the same thing.  This wasn't French Onion soup with layers of flavor, but an onion broth that had some cheap, melted cheese on top.  It didn't taste bad, but anyone could make this soup.\n\nI ate half the soup and passed it on to my friend to finish along with the rest of the chicken breast.  I didn't want to eat too much and then not be able to eat the main course.  \n\nAs my friend finished the soup our entrees arrived.  The cheeseburger was served on a piece of a larger sesame baguette and came well done rather than the requested medium.  I didn't try it due to the fact it was overcooked and had sesame seeds.  I did try the apple sauce and the potato salad, though.  The potato salad was just not tasty.  One bite and I didn't want to take another.  The apple sauce, on the other hand, was quite tasty -- I wouldn't call it apple sauce, though.  It was more along the line of fried apples -- some damn tasty fried apples.\n\nAs I wasn't having any of the cheeseburger, I ate all of the fish tacos.  The tacos arrived presented on a sprinkling of iceberg lettuce.  I would think that they should make it a bed of lettuce or just omit it all together.  I am for the latter over the former as I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- no nutrients, just water.  While the fish didn't have bad flavor, it was a tad overcooked.  When I started to eat the tacos, this wasn't a big deal.  As the fish cooled off, though, they started to get too hard for their own good.  The fish tacos need to be cooked less, especially with the fact that they are using white, flaky fish, which is easily overcooked.  At least the guacamole was fresh and tasted good.\n\nAll in all, this was a lackluster event.  If not for the fried apples, guacamole, and great service this would have been a one-star.  I don't know that I would ever willingly return since I was in sticker shock when our server brought our check.  The price was not commensurate with the quality of the food.  People complain about the quality of the food at Ritter's diner, but the food is actually commensurate to the price that you pay.  When I pay over $20 a person to eat, I expect better than diner fare."
"2","Great flavor, nice ambiance, and delightful evening."
"1","Huge menu, reasonably price, extremely mediocre food, with a nice plate of chocolate chip cookies with your bill.  I ate here when it first opened 20 years ago and it was good back then.  But over the years it has gone down hill.  Way down hill.  I won't go back.  It kind of reminds me of food you'd eat at when you are stuck in an airport."
"1","The restaurant has a nice setting and pleasant decor, but the food is seriously lacking.  I always know it's going to be trouble when the menu is excessively long... that says to me that the restaurant does many things, but really nothing well.  And that's exactly what I got at Cafe Sam.  I had a pulled pork sandwhich that was bland, dry, and not particularly well put together.  My girlfriend had a similarly bland meal.  It was fine for lunch while we killed time waiting on the dealership to finish working on her car, but I won't be back by choice.  Toast!  down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch."
"2","Great experience. Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers. Most of the items we had for dinner (appetizers, entrees and dessert)"
"1","As much as I love the food here, I'm sad to say this is likely our last time coming here. I realize that coming as a party of 5 on Saturday night without a reservation is usually tough to accommodate, yet I was pleasantly surprised when the hostess told me they would move a table around and it would be about 10 minutes. \n\nWe waited for 15-20 minutes and watched about 4 parties get sat before we asked what was taking so long since she had told us they were just moving a table. The hostess was very defensive and said that we shouldn't expect to get sat so soon without a reservation on a Saturday night, so we asked why she told us it would be 10 minutes. She then said that she needed to seat people with reservations before she could seat us and completely refused to acknowledge that she had given us a misleading wait time. I understand that it's hard to guage wait times, but when you're wrong you should simply apologize and not blame the guests for how they planned their evening. \n\nWhen we finally got sat, our server Angel was very good and the Buffalo style salmon steak is delicious. \n\nI really like the food here, but the fact of the matter is their customer service tonight was inexcusable. Even when the customer is wrong, you don't blame them and say \""I'm sorry, but...\"" You simply apologize and try to defuse the situation instead of getting defensive and escalating the situation. If the hostess had simply said \""I apologize for the wait taking longer than expected, we should be able to seat you in 5 minutes\"" and thanked us for our patience there would never have been an issue. \n\nI love the food, but I won't be coming back."
"2","I was totally blown away by our Mother's Day meal at Cafe Sam.  The dishes were creative and well presented.  The prices were very reasonable for the quality.  Our waitress, Corrin was delightful and smart and friendly and lovely.  The menu was as good as it gets.  I wanted to tear a page out and hand it to the waitress and ask her to bring me this.   A great value, plenty of parking.  Why would anybody go to the Olive Garden or Red Lobster.  This was better and cheaper.  Next visit to Pittsburgh, I'll be back."
"1","The restaurant operates out of a renovated brothel...my brother and I dined at the bar...which had various house infused liquors...(maple whiskey...peppercorn vodka...cherry vodka...pickled gin... Dirty vodka..others)..we ordered the buffalo chicken medallions for appetizer...which were at best average ...my top shelf long island was average....food delivery was slow and the bartender was occupied for a whoke before taking our order...the bathrooms are dated....it seems like this restaurant is catered to 50+...the dining hall was not busy but our appetizer took nearly 20 minutes to come out and our entree over 30 minutes..my snapper was average on a bed of collard greens.  ..whipped sweet potatoes average again and creamed kake was definitely average.  ..the host brought out complimentary marinated mushrooms which were pretty good after our dinner...our dessert was chocolate cake a la mode..which was a cold cake with a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  The chocolate cake again at best average...the bill came to 90 with my brother ordering the cod and a beer. I had a Bailey's on ice which was probably the best thing I ordered..."
"2","My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight and it was amazing! I read that it was hard to get seated so we made a reservation. We were seated as soon as we arrived. It was not very crowded at all but that could have been because it was late. We had the ahi tuna tartar and Italian sausage for our appetizers. My boyfriend had the porterhouse with parsley potatoes which came with a vinegar base slaw and baked apples. I had the filet with pasta which came with the same slaw and apples. We also had the pear tart for dessert... Everything we had was delicious!! I would recommend giving this place a try for sure. It will likely become our Friday night date spot! :)"
"2","One of the first things I did when I had a little free time after moving to PIttsburgh was to locate a good CD store.  Paul's definitely fits the bill.  A small but extremely orderly (re: alphabetized!) shop.  I knew what I was looking for, otherwise I could have spent an hour browsing.  Genre sections are clearly labeled and easy to find.  Right when you walk in, you'll find a rack of the newest releases on your right hand side.  \n\nAfter I had acquired my bounty of Wolf Parade and Stephen Malkmus discs, it was time for the final test... having a chat with the staff.  The experience was good - they are friendly and very knowledgeable, and I can look forward to asking them for recommendations."
"2","One of the great independent record stores, Karl Hendricks runs his business just like he plays: with passion and creativity."
"1","Paddy cake bakery is a step up from the typical grocery store bakery but not by far. While many of the pastries are \""good\"" I haven't had anything from this bakery that really called me back for more. One might say there is a \""richness\"" lacking in ingredients.\n\nMany of the pastries are average price 75 cents to $1.50 for individual pastries with some items on sale for a $1 and I suspect these sale items might be a cheap, risk free way for you to acquaint yourself with this bake shop. I've visited Paddy Cake on 3 occasions.  Once had small cookies with chocolate icing centers (can't remember the name), once a creme filled Pizzelle ( icing too sweet and not rich enough for me), and once a cupcake that tasted just like the very cheap ones you might find in the grocery.\n\nTo be sure this place is a bit of a Bloomfield icon, and you might enjoy the bake shop charm is has to offer. It is to be noted that this location is not for sitting and eating or loitering. It's simply a shop to drop into and satiate the sweet tooth."
"2","Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night screaming, \""I NEED TO GO TO PADDY CAKE BAKERY\"". Okay, that may be a lie, but if you've been here you'd know why I'm saying this.\n\nAs much as I love the newfangled bakeries such as Vanilla and the now defunked Dozen, to me, there is nothing like a good old fashioned take a number type of bakery. Paddy Cake is located on Liberty Avenue near West Penn Hospital. If you blink you'd miss it which leaves more cookies for me.\n\nIt's hard to describe the desserts with any other adjective other than delicious. I hate to sound corny and easy to please but the thumbprints are to die for. Everything I've bought there has been better than I anticipated. Donuts- amazing. Cookies- wonderful. Pastries- Delicious. I think you get the point. I feel like I come with a ten dollar bill, leave with money and have a bag full of goodies. The money will soon be spent on milk to wash these puppies down."
"1","My family has ordered from this bakery for OVER 20 YEARS- POSSIBLY 30?! Well, in the past 9 years or so, I have seen their quality rapidly go further and further downhill. Worse and worse quality to the product, declining taste and poorer ingredients are plainly evident. Sloppier and sloppier decorating, ruder and ruder counter staff.\n\nWe have continued to shop there simply due to the location being convenient, but these days you are really TAKING YOUR CHANCES as to whether the items you buy from them will be somewhat tasty or TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Still, I try to support neighborhood businesses as much as possible so it does break my heart to trash them in a review like this, but these things need to be said.\n\nThey continue to have a lot of customers due to their location and due to people remembering how good they USED TO BE, so when folks are back visiting their old neighborhood, they return to this bakery for the memories. But oh, how the standards have fallen!\n\nWe got some cupcakes for a party last year in November that we literally could not eat, they were so dry and bad- they went in the trash (not cheap either). Thank goodness it was just a small kiddie birthday get-together and not an important occasion with guests I would have been embarrassed in front of.\n\nWe considered getting our wedding cake from them (again, in order to support a neighborhood place) in 2008 but they gave us such a hard time regarding even getting an appointment for a cake consultation that we went with another baker, out in the west end. Looking back, I am glad it happened that way.\n\nAs for daily items, their breads are usually decent and their donuts are edible (not great, just satisfactory) but have way too much sickly-sweet frosting. Cookies are usually fine but sometimes their cake decorating is clearly being done as such a rush job that it's sloppy beyond description. Danishes and many other items give the impression that something went sort of wrong with the recipe, items are heavy and greasy when they should be fluffy or flaky or soft and moist. Items seem overcooked or undercooked. I wonder if they ever really taste test what they are producing. Also I don't know how they get away with serving such pathetic cannolis in an Italian neighborhood- pastry cream and zero ricotta, plus just in general- funky ingredients that are blantantly, obviously pre-fab, no fillings seem freshly made, it's all out of some mass-produced tube. And for this low quality, they make you pay premium prices, OF COURSE!\n\nNothing is marked with price or name of the item, and when you ask, most of  the counter staff consistently take a disgusted tone with you and treat you like you are stupid, rolling their eyes at you (the only exception being the youngest girls that work there, in their early 20s, who are consistently very good at being polite when helping customers). The more mature ladies frequently say snarky things to me like: \""That's not a cinnamon SPIN, that's a cinnamon DONUT. That's not a DANISH, that's a FRUIT PASTRY.\"" If you don't want to have to answer questions, then put up labels and tags with the names and prices and info, so customers can read what terms you are expecting us to use!\n\nMost recently, I picked up a birthday cake for my father's birthday, and it looked like a child decorated it. Seriously. I could have done a better job myself. Maybe they are employing the cheapest bakers and decorators rather than the more talented ones. If this is the case, it certainly shows.  \n\nI think I am DONE with continuing to try to support this \""neighborhood landmark.\"" Any time you complain, it seems to do no good-- they do not see the need to heed customer comments and improve."
"1","We stopped in this morning at Paddy Cake Bakery to sample some donuts/treats/whatever caught our fancy. It wasn't the nicest place on the inside, and the ordering process seemed kind of chaotic. It looked like they did have a \""take a number\"" kind of system, but weren't using it when we were there. I ended up getting a cinnamon roll and a cake donut, as I couldn't decide and we were heading to the gym anyway, so I didn't feel guilty. Wife got a chocolate frosted longhorn style donut that was covered in sprinkles. I feel like a good measure of a place that claims to have amazing donuts is their plain cake donut. If you can do this properly, then good things are to come when you order other things. This was probably the worst plain cake donut I've ever had. It was dry, not at all crispy, and had no flavor. I couldn't even finish it. And I love pastry. I would have rather had a cake donut from Giant Eagle or Dunkin Donuts, and that's a sad statement. Those are honestly better. The cinnamon roll was just ok, until I bit into the center, where the dough was almost raw. I understand not wanting to over cook your cinnamon rolls, but this was not a fun surprise. I sampled my wife's donut as I wanted to be able to comment on it, and I found the chocolate icing to be artificial tasting. This is the first time I've eaten donuts and thrown pieces of everything away.\n\nThis place was...well, edible. I didn't find it to be anything special. We didn't sample the cookies or cakes, but if the donuts are any indication, I don't want to try them."
"2","After meeting with several bakeries that want to \""rape your wallet\"" with crazy charges on wedding cakes, we met Susie from Paddy Cake.  She is absolutely fantastic - willing to listen to all of your crazy ideas and the prices at Paddy Cake are very reasonable.  The cake is also FABULOUS - seriously, the best white almond cake that I have ever tasted.  Not being able to wait until the wedding, we've actually ordered small cakes for every occasion preceding the event because the cake is just that good.  I highly recommend this bakery to anyone!  From the giant lady locks (seriously, the size of your face) to the freaking phenomenal wedding cakes, this place has it all."
"1","Recently was in the Bloomfield area and thought I would stop by for a donut.  I ordered a long john which looked pretty good.  Unfortunately it wasn't.   I am pretty sure they simply took a hot dog bun and fried it, then put icing on top.  I ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker.  So many great bakeries in Pittsburgh so I would not go back."
"2","I'm having an affair. A pizza affair. I have forsaken my darling Adrian's for Angelo's... And it's all because of a white pizza. \n\nOkay, for realz now: Angelo's white pizza is ridiculously delicious. It comes with tomatoes. I added pepperoni, 'cause I was feeling kinda wild. When the pizza arrived and I opened the lid, I had to gasp. The cheese! Ohh, the glorious cheese!\n\nThere were regal mountains of ricotta... Majestic valleys of melted mozzarella... Fragrant Italian herbs infiltrated my nostrils... Why am I using the word \""nostrils\"" in a restaurant review? Gross. \n\nAnyway, it took all my willpower not to have a pizza eating contest with myself right then and there. You just have to try this pizza. The crust, the tomato, and the pepperoni are all awesome, too, but trust me -- if you like cheese (and who doesn't), you'll love this.\n\nOn top of that, their fries are fresh and served in lah-arge portions, and their steak, cheese, and mushroom sandwich is phenomenal. I get it sans the tomato and lettuce -- but keep the onions and mayo. The bread is all nice and toasty, and I swear there's some secret ingredient in there that is a magical a flavor booster, 'cause it's just SO delish!"
"2","I was skeptical about going to a typical pizza shop during a food tour in Bloomfield, but boy was I wrong. This pizza is really good and you can tell that they do not pick the cheap ingredients off of the shelf. The dough was perfect (cooked well, but kinda doughy) and the cheese was excellent."
"2","The large pizza is huge. Don't underestimate it.\n\nBe sure to try the \""Angelo's Special\"" sandwich with the homemade mayo sauce."
"1","Sad to say, this wasn't the pie in the sky I was looking for. It all comes down to the crust--I threw it out. That should never happen. The crust wasn't enough like the bread from la gourmandine--if that bakery made pizza with the cheese (and even the sauce) from Angelos...now THAT could have some potential. So...still shopping around for a delivery and for a crust that bubbles up around the edges. It might have to do with the water or kneading or something?"
"1","I am not really certain how this place is getting the stellar reviews that it has. we just had a quick bite there last night and it was easily one of the worst meals that I have ever had the pleasure of paying for. While the people running the shop were lovely, it was not worth the $17 or so we paid.\n\nI had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce. you would think that might be a nice time to let me know that they use some sort of house garlic-herb mayo instead of actual mayo. but no. So after a good bit of waiting my sub comes out with this weird speckly dressing on top of the lettuce... yes, this is that mayo - which is disgusting. I thought it was ranch and that is when he lady, with a smile, explained it was their house mayo... no, they don't use regular mayo here. \n\nso, let me tell you about this mayo:\n\n1. it is heavily flavored with garlic powder - which tastes seriously like chemicals on a good day and just should not be considered food in any way shape or form. Mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix? who knows. all I could taste was the overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic and cook with it daily - mind you I actually use the real stuff. \n\n2. it is really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed to be thick and spreadable? even the stuff you see at subway is thicker. this stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing.\n\nSo, after giving it a good effort to try to eat this \""sub\"" - I gave up and picked off the bread on the top of the sub - the bread was pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided to try to scrap off the mayo/lettuce disaster and go for the meat and cheese. um... salt? the meat, which suspiciously looked like those thin sheets of steak-um had zero flavor. one bite and I rejected it. While we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage? I am paying almost 6 bucks for this sub. I want to see yummy chopped up steak bits like you see at even a mall sub shop. not this grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless \""meat\"".  At least the bottom of the sub roll was salvageable... I ate the bread. \n\nOn to the pizza. My husband had two slices of pepperoni and my daughter had a slice of plain cheese. \n\nOk, pizza. well, this too was a massive disappointment. since I was still hungry after dumping the majority of my sub I tried both of their pizza slices. it reminded me of a nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce with flavorless cheese. \n\nMy husband is a freak for pepperoni pizza and of the two slices he almost finished one of them. yes, more for the garbage. My daughter? she is three.. she isn't really a foodie (yet) but she got thru some of her cheese pizza... she actually spit some of it out but to be fair - she is three. I tried her pizza and honestly, all I could manage to somewhat enjoy was the crust which was nothing to rave about but it was tolerable. \n\nTo provide a baseline - we typically order from Rialto's and while they are not terrible they decent enough for a sub shop - pizza place.  this place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended up throwing out about 80% of what we paid for. This place insults their customers with sub-par, dated, poor quality food."
"1","I order frame Angelo's regularly .Quality in going downhill.First I waited on hold for 10min ,so I drive over and I'm still on hold,I go in there's one person inside and no orders ..WTF am I holding for .?...So my order is $30+ and I asked for a ranch and of course I have to pay for it ?Then I get my white pizza home and it looks like it was in a tornado,this seems to be happening more often..and delivery don't get me started.My rating is PISS POOR!!!"
"1","Honestly, the hoagies are fantastic, but their service is appalling. I ordered two hoagies and received one and a half. After calling and explaining the situation, Aaron, the \""manager\"", rationalized that their hoagies are large and could send another half \""depends on how hungry you are\"". ARE YOU SERIOUS?! I have never in my life heard of such asinine customer service. The girl on the phone was really nice though...if that counts for anything. They just lost a loyal customer...never again."
"2","Best Pizza Shop in Bloomfield. Hands down one of the best Sicilian Pizzas around! Sicilian Cuts and Cheese Fries are my go to every time I dine here! Plus they sell Turner's Tea!"
"1","They get 1 star because less was not an option. Was told by someone at the hospital that the steak hoagies are great. Well either our opinions differ greatly on food or we just got hosed. Looked up the menu online. $9.00 for a lrg Angelo special. Think philly cheese steak. So I ordered 2 for myself and my gf. I asked for mine with well done peppers onions and mushrooms no lettuce or tomato. I get there and the total is over $24! So I ask why. I'm told \""oh yeah that's the owners fault he doesn't want to update the online website so it's a little out of date.\"" A LITTLE!?!?? Two and a half dollars more is not a little. So I leave already feeling taken but hey they are big and they feel heavy so I'm still optimistic. WRONG AGAIN! The sandwiches nearly fell out through the grease soaked bag and found my sandwich covered in grease swimming lettuce and tomatoes with pale mushrooms and uncooked peppers. Swimming I tell you swimming in grease! If I have a heart atack I'll know why. Called to complain and was pretty much told it was my fault they became greasy because I took to long to get there! And that its all the owners fault about the price. Poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership. The next thing that should be poor is the owner because I will NEVER eat there again."
"2","While I was a little skeptical walking into the place, I loved the experience in the end.  EVERYTHING you need, or could possibly ever think of needing is there in the shop, in multiples.  If you don't know what you're looking for, or how to fix it, Gerry will help you.  As will the 6 other bike fanatics who are in the shop working on their own bikes.  The prices can't be beat.  And, while you have to do the work yourself, it's really rewarding to walk out of there with a bike you fixed yourself.  Same repairs at REI or Dick's would have been two to three times as much.  Would definitely go back for more!"
"2","This place feels like home - a home built of tires and bolts and lots of unidentifiable bicycle parts.  My first visit to Kraynick's was during a panic situation, otherwise known as a tire blow-out.  Having commuted to work daily by bike for 3+ years, I've been strangely immune to things like flats, blowouts, or really anything of the sort.  So when it happened, I had no clue what to do.  I thought about visiting Performance Bike in East Liberty, where I purchased my current ride, but the lure of Kraynick's was too much.  Plus, I was able to leave work 10 minutes early and actually get there before their 6pm closing time.  \n\nWith busted tire in one hand, I pushed the door open and was greeted with - well, I'm not really sure how to describe it.  An avalanche perhaps, of bicycle parts EVERYWHERE.  Seriously, hanging in every nook and cranny; taking up every inch of counter space; even occupying each step of the stairs near the front door (at least I think they were stairs...).  I'm pretty sure I just stood there in awe for a minute before taking a few more hesitant steps inside.  \n\nI'd read enough reviews to know that the white-haired man was Jerry.  I waited for a few minutes while Jerry finished up with his customer and then just sort of presented my tire to him with a smile and a look that said \""please don't judge me for not knowing what to do about this.\""  No judgement.  Jerry told me that it was a dangerous blowout and he hoped that I hadn't been going too fast.  Then he plucked an identical tire from the ceiling rack above his head and asked me if I needed anything else.  I rocked back and forth on my heels a few times before sheepishly asking if he could tell me how to change the tire once I returned home.  In, I swear, no less than 10 words, he explained the process and wished me luck.  For $20 I bought a tire, tube and the, um, the things you use to take the tire off...tire irons?  I'll take a class someday. Seriously.  \n\nAaaanyway.  I returned to the shop earlier this week with the other tire, which had been experiencing an annoying slow leak.  Jerry told me it was just the tube and offered his tools in \""the back\"" so I could do a quick change.  Well, if the front room was filled to the brim with every part under the cycle sun, the back room was equally bursting with every tool imaginable; none of which I knew how to use.  With the kind help of a few of the guys who were working on their own bikes, I managed to change out the tube in no time, leaving the shop with a kind of silly sense of accomplishment and some incredibly black hands."
"2","The best pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!"
"2","I was in Pittsburgh since yesterday from out of town on business. Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in. There are tables and chairs, but as I mentioned...the smell is a little off-putting. like the inside of an old dish cloth.  If they could fix that, they would be golden."
"2","Lived in a number of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and finding that locations best pizza is always a challenge.  I have followed friends advice, magazine reviews, etc., etc. with mixed success.  Having moved to Stanton Hts. I was at a loss, but driving around Bloomfield, the first one to catch my eye was Graziano's. A great mix of locals, students and employees from Children's Hospital.  The pizza was great.  Somewhat thin crust, baked bubbly and crispy around the edges, can use more sauce but the mix of cheeses quickly remedies that shortage.  Toppings are great.  Makes a great breakfast the next day outta the fridge!!\nThe beer selection is admirable.  The service varies depending on who is at the counter.\nSince discovering Graziano's I have been up and down Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield and always return to Graziano's.  The only other place to get my business would be Aiello's in Squirrel Hill."
"1","I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also, the toppings were not greatly blended, just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust.\nI work right next door, but wont go there again.\nI usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted, so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading."
"2","Service was quick. Barbers are friendly and experienced. I was in and out in 15, and only paid 10 bucks. I strongly recommend them!"
"2","Old fashioned barber shop. Been doing business here for years. Good, fast, cheap."
"2","Really cheap, & really quick! As mentioned before, the barbers do listen to you & cut your hair just the way you ask them. \n\nOnly drawback, if you see it as such, is that they specialize  in just traditional cuts (buzz cut, crew cut, etc). Nothing too edgy or crazy\n\nThis is a cash only place, so don't forget the $10!"
"2","Read some reviews and decided to try them out. Im very pleased with the haircut and even more pleased with the price. Walked right in, no wait, asked for what i wanted and they delivered. Will be returning!"
"2","I appreciate this joint very much.  An amazing deal at 10 bucks (plus a few for tip). i can't quite get my hair exactly to the way I like it, mainly because I can't quite describe how I actually expect the final product to be, but they do a great job with my vague descriptions. this, and they get the haircut done in around 10 minutes.  even when there are three people ahead of me, I'm not worried about spending too much of my time waiting."
"2","Just went there for the first time today, very nice barbers and great price! Would recommend them to everyone!"
"1","Last barber on the left was who helped me. Very nice but not very skilled. He uses plastic guards for his shears and also I noticed after washing my hair I have very thin parts that were cut much shorter than the rest of my hair. Luckily my hair grows fast. I trusted Yelp! reviews but they let me down. I may try one of the other barbers with real shears once more but I am hesitant to recommend or go back here with  confidence."
"2","OMG , I Found one of the VERY BEST Hot Sausage WITH CHEESE sandwiches that I have EVER tasted. Pizza Italia is a wonderful small business ( and I LOVE Small Buz ! ) You should check with your cardiologist before ordering these fine delicacies. This is a great balance of fine Italian hot sausage with onions and souses.  They even speak Italian to each other !\n\nPizza-hut can burn in hell ! This is how it should be done !!!\nAlso , The Prices are very reasonable."
"2","I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my girlfriend and another dining companion for dinner.  We decided to come here after after reading all of the good Yelp reviews.  It is a pretty easy place to find as it is right on Liberty but I was a bit disappointed whenever I walked inside.  You see we were looking at eating it there and they have no tables.  Thankfully it was nice outside and they did have a couple of seats in front although that left us subjected to the cigarette smoke of the workers and a crazy group of loud people right next to us.\n\nFor our dinner we decided to order a XL cheese pizza and also a large white pizza.  We started with the white pizza and boy did it hit the spot.  The crust was crunchy, the garlic and herbs in the oil sauce were tasty and the cheese was decent as well.  Our red pizza was a similar experience as I imagine the cheese and crust were the same and while the red sauce was good, it lacked a little of the oomph that white sauce had.  Overall though they were two very solid pizzas that I enjoyed.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  The prices were good and the pizza good as well, now if they only had some inside seating."
"2","You want pizza? You'll getta pizza. It's good. Definitely my go-to for price and quality, but, despite being my standard, it doesn't have that extra je ne sais quoi that would make a five star slice. By the slice pizzas often sit for awhile, and though a slice is only $1.30, they're only about 30% of a slice wide, so I'd recommend going in for a whole pie."
"2","Basic pizza. Pretty solid, not too expensive and open till 11:00 on weeknights. Really not much to complain about."
"1","I have only had the lunch buffet, which really isn't fair to write a review off of.  While cheap and I would consider a good deal, it was overall greasy and bland.\n\nOnce I go back and order something off the menu I will have to re-review."
"1","I am disappointed.  I have lived in the neighborhood for over 6 years and I keep giving them a second chance (and a third).  The take out menu says in big letter on the front 15% off take out.  So we ordered again, although we generally get poor service and the food is average at best.  \n\nThis time we ordered 2 entrees and and a few sides.  When I went to pick up the order they had given us 15% off ONE ENTREE.  So it was no discount at all.  When you mention something to them about poorly worded menu and the principle of false advertising they argue with you.  \n\nSo we are done with them, no more peoples we will drive down to Taste of India from now on."
"2","Way better than India Garden. The interior isnt that great, but the food more than makes up for it. The buffet is a great price and you get a good selection."
"2","Delicious food and reasonably priced, especially if you go during there happy hours!"
"1","I've ordered for delivery a few times.  Although you get small portions for the price..the food is pretty good.  This time I and a coworker ordered 2 seperate dishes that came with rice.  They combined the rice in one container.  Why?  My coworker leaves in 10 mins with my rice....ugh!  Called the restaurant and all I get is a ...\""wellll..I don't know what I can do?\""   Are you serious?"
"2","I just wrote a bad review so I want to counter it with a good one. People's Restaurant easily wins the top slot on Kelly G's list of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. The restaurant itself is small and no-frills (Indian shabby chic, you might call it), but they have a big table in the middle suitable for large parties. Their lunch buffet is smaller than India Garden's but slightly more delicious. Greg B. and I get take out, add a bottle of wine, and have romantic dinner parties-for-two on our front porch. Perfection."
"1","I would write a \""0\"" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \""Unblurred\"" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \""reserved\"" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. \n\nWhether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not? \n\nWith the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating."
"2","I've been hearing how great people's is from friends, so decided to check them out. I went for the lunch buffet. I arrived around 1pm when it ends at 2:30pm. There was still fresh food on the buffet. They refilled while I was there. As a vegan I appreciate Indian food & had many options. Usually my gauge for any Indian place it the Chana masala, my favorite dish. I was super impressed with theirs. Perfectly steamed  chickpeas with right amount of spice & cilantro! A second favorite was the Aloo Pang which is spinach potatoes & spices. The nan was fresh & hot. Also, the service was great, I never once had to ask for water. \n\nFor my second experience with people's I decided to order take out. They do free delivery to the surrounding area! (I live in Stanton Heights) it came within an hour of calling & was freshly made. I had no complaints. I order Chana Masala, Aloo pang & nan....it was about $20, lasted me dinner & lunch the next day ! Plan to\nOrder again soon"
"2","The lunch buffet on Saturday is great hangover food.  it is cheap, hot, refreshed often, and has the standard selection.  I love going here."
"2","At first glance I wasn't too impressed with the buffet, I thought it'd be another botched attempt of authentic Indian food. While the selection is not that impressive, I would say that the quality is pretty damn good. \nI debated for a long time with my friend about the food going back and forth between a 3 and a 4. I ended up going with the 4 due to the Indian tea that they had - hard to find at any buffet!. \nThey aren't trying to wow you with exotic ingredients or fun twists, it's almost as if you're sitting down at someone's house and eating what they'd eat on a regular basis. Plus you're paying around 9 dollars for a buffet, I mean- let's get real. You get what you pay for."
"1","Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad, especially for late night half off. Called in advance to make sure they were open until 10 and had half off like they used to. The woman who answered the phone said yes to both so I rushed over. The portions were small, but I assumed it was because it was half price so I shrugged it off. The tomato sauce was chunky and generic, the raita side dish was 4 spoonfuls big, and the chutney dips were cold and bland. Assuming this was due to the discount, I didn't complain. Receive my check to find out it was all full price. Despite the woman telling me on the phone that it was half off, it was buy one get one half off. The woman on the phone was the same as the hostess. She admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake. I don't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous. A subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing. Never going back despite the fond memories I had accumulated when in school. Completely ridiculous."
"2","I take back everything I said in a previous post (about all Indian restaurants tasting the same and that it all tastes like something out of a box)!!\n\nI was so completely wrong! \n\nPeople's is amazing and fresh, vegetarian friendly, pleasant staff, warm and inviting."
"2","Went here for dinner twice in 1 week when I was craving Indian food. The food is pretty good compared to other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Also, it's BYOB with no corkage charge. The service is also great. Just took off one star for the naan- it was a little burnt each time I came here."
"1","Very expensive and quantity was quite less. I am an Indian and I love Indian food but their food gave me hard time in digestion; I suffered for 2 days. \n\nPrice-wise too, I wound't order again when I can have whole buffet at Tamarind at less than half price. I ordered chicken curry, the one at Coriander Restaurant on Murray Ave is yummy but this one was so-so in taste, mostly disappointing. I also ordered Samosa, I find the poorly fried samosas of Bombay Mart better than these ones. Then I ordered tikki (aloo patty), really disappointed, it looked several weeks old reheated in microwave. I know from 24 years of experience how fresh tikki tastes like. \n\nI like Indian restaurants in this order: Uddupi, Tamarind, Coriander, Indian Carts at Pitt, even Yuva India and All India more than this one. But definitely it's better than Prince of India, where food smells like 2 week old and there is absolutely no taste in the food."
"2","This is closer to home-cooked Indian food than your average Indian restaurant. The lunch buffet is yummy. The chai is absolutely delicious!\n\nI am there almost every weekend for their lunch buffet. Yes, it is that good!"
"2","My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, the dinner experience was wonderful.\n\nWe both got combo meals, he the chicken curry and I the fish curry. The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a \""10\"" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted \""American 10\"" or \""Indian 10\"". After finding out that \""American 10\"" = \""Indian 5\"", I was steered toward the \""Indian 7\"" which really was perfect for me. (In previous trips, we had both thought the food a touch mild, but knowing there was an Indian heat scale fixed that problem right off).\n\nIt was a wonderful dinner, and I can't wait for our next trip!"
"1","Maybe I went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible. The spring rolls were falling apart and only filled with noodles and a couple of sad looking shrimp, no thai basil or mint leaves or cilantro to speak of. I also got some crispy noodles with seafood which I only ate because I had been sitting on a train for 9 hours and was starving. And the whole thing was seriously overpriced for Pittsburgh, New York prices for extremely subpar vietnamese, meh."
"1","So I am currently sitting here with Pho Minh's Pho tai...and I honestly have to say I am not impressed.  Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.\n\nI decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...\n\nThe broth is actually good, very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy, smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth, and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them, and barely any shrimp.\n\nAll in all, I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday, but otherwise...nay"
"1","No way, dudes. Go down the street and get some tastier food at Tram's Kitchen. The grub is better, the restaurant itself is a little cleaner (not saying much on either account), and the water even tastes better. \n\nReally. I'm not joking about the water."
"2","I absolutely LOVE noodle soups.  From cold winter nights to a late night snack in the summer, a big bowl of pho always hits the spot (as does ramen or beef noodle soup, but that'll be for other reviews).\n\nPho Minh serves up pho with debatably the most fragrant beef broth in Pittsburgh.  Their pho also always comes with sliced rare beef, which is sometimes cooked well done at other pho places (COUGH TRAM's KITCHEN COUGH).  Also, they do some of the \""unique\"" parts such as tripe, which I am a fan of.\n\nService is reasonably fast, the atmosphere is reasonably dingy in a comforting homey way, and the food is tasty.  Yes, if I want some fresh spring rolls (Gi cun), I'll probably head to Tram's, but when I want pho, I want no nonsense pho, and Pho Minh is the place to be.\n\nOn a sidenote; their other dishes are pretty good too, but for me I'm heading to Pho Minh for their pho."
"2","when tram's is out of the equation, this is my backup. just as good."
"1","I had my second bowl of pho in Pittsburgh here, and although it was better than my first bowl, it was still pretty disappointing.  The broth is everything for pho.  Pho broth takes like nine hours to make.  The broth at Pho Minh is bland and almost clear in color.  Good broth should be dark and pungent, not like watered down chicken broth.  I had the combination beef with tripe pho, and there was literally about five small pieces of beef in there.  I guess since there is not much competition here for Vietnamese food, the $8 price tag is valid, even though that's much more than what I normally pay for good pho elsewhere.\n\nWe also ordered the deep fried spring rolls, and that was a disappointment too.  Mine was also still cold in the center, so I can only guess that they are frozen beforehand."
"2","This is my favorite type of restaurant, regardless of cuisine; namely, a family run institution with great food, friendly service and an almost complete disinterest in spiffing up the surroundings. Yes, Pho Minh is a bit divey, and I relish this quality. The pho is great, as are all of the dishes I've tried here. I also have a deep appreciation for restaurants that do one cuisine and do it well...none of this Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese combo that only serves to confuse the diner as well as, often, the kitchen. Between this place and Tram's down the street, Pho Minh is my favorite. Pittsburgh has a woeful dearth of good restaurants...I'll try not to go on too much about that in my reviews, as I don't want your eyes to glaze over...so this is a destination restaurant for us. There are very few things more satisfying than a deep bowl of pho on a cold winter day."
"2","Tram's has better *ahem* \""atmosphere\"".  Pho Minh has better Pho."
"2","I just graduated from CMU and the thing that I miss most about Pittsburgh is Pho Minh.  Their pho is unbelievable and their #4 (pork spring roll) is equally as amazing.  Moreover, Pho Minh completely trumps Tram's Kitchen.\n\nI took my parents here for my \""last meal\"" before leaving the City and they loved it, too.  They aren't into 'ethnic food' at all.  That being said, I would take ANYONE here.  Their grilled chicken (#30 something) is perfect for people who dislike pho.  \n\nIt's a must if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh."
"2","In sum, I very much enjoy this place. Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post. \n\nFor an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \""as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\"" YUMMY!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing. \n\nThe staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.\n\nThere are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person."
"2","The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!"
"2","This is a vet for cats, not a vet for people. This staff is going to do what is best for your cat, make recommendations for the benefit of your cat, and that may not always be the most convenient thing for you, as a human person. However, if you love your cat(s), this is the place to be. \n\nOne of my cats is extremely nervous in public situations, but always calms around the Dr. here. The doctor seems to talk to the cat in some secret mystical cat language. There is a real sense of cat community, from the portraits of the clinic's cats, to the bulletin board with cat-related notices, to the high-quality toys and treats for sale. \n\nAnother of our cats went to the great litterbox in the sky at this office. This is a horrible, difficult, awful thing to live through. I miss him terribly every day, even though it has been years. I am very grateful that the Cat Clinic & their wonderful staff was there for us. I am not sure that any other vet would have held me and said comforting things while I sobbed, taken phone calls from my friend, and provided such solid E for Effort. \n\nI have always felt like we have received the best possible service here. Even though they are a bit more expensive than \""budget\"" vets around town, the experience here has always been worth every penny. The peace of mind that comes from knowing you are doing the best by your pet is priceless to me. Cats don't have voices and cats can't make their own decisions about their health."
"1","Once I learned that Dr. Bebko charged twice as much as The Humane Society, I stopped taking my cat to the Cat Clinic. If you only need an annual examination and shots, go to The Humane Scoiety (and make a donation!). If you have an emergency, go to the VCA Castle Shannon Animal Hospital. For everything else, try the Cat Clinic. A day before a recent trip, my cat began behaving erratically. Because I live near the Cat Clinic and they had a same-day appointment available, I went there. I waited 40 minutes past my appointment time and I didn't appreciate Dr. Bebko's \""doom and gloom\"" comments. I won't be returning if I can help it."
"1","A local friend who considers Dr. Bebko an extraordinarily good vet checked and was told Dr. Bebko did consult with other out of area vets and would be happy to do that with my vet on behalf of my very sick kitty, but the cat's records would need to be faxed to him. \n\nMy vet's office, here in Texas,  did so, and because the chest x-rays could only be sent via e-mail she called Dr. Bebko's office. She was told that Dr. Bebko did NO consultations regarding an animal he had not personally seen.  He added that she (my vet tech) was wasting his and her time, that Dr. Bebko would NOT be looking at the faxed information., and not to bother with the x-rays.  (Since my cat has a collapsed lung, records without x-rays are pretty useless.) \n\nWhen I reported this to my friend who had spoken so highly of Dr. Bebko, she called his office and was told the exact opposite...  Maybe the doctor IS good, but I'll never know because his office is either certifiably crazy or incredibly rude...maybe both. \n\n And, yes, of course there are feline specialists right here in Texas, but I wanted THIS particular doctor because of my friend's recommendation."
"1","Wow!  Talk about attitude on the phone!  After all the glowing reviews that I read on-line, I decided to call this place and schedule and appointment for my cat who has been having issues lately.  Due to my work schedule, I requested a Saturday appointment but was told that they don't take new clients on Saturdays.  When I explained my situation, I was told that those were the rules of the clinic and that there were no exceptions.  I asked about late hours but the latest appointment is at 6 PM.  I work until 6PM.  I asked about early morning appointments but was told that they begin see patients at 10 AM.  I start work at 9 AM.  I was then told that I should take a day off to bring the cat in for an exam.  When I expressed my frustration, I was told, \""Well, I'm sorry.  We reserve our Saturdays for existing clients only.\"" I replied that I would have been a client if they were willing to accommodate me.  I got a snippy, \""Well, I'm sorry.\""  Never mind!  I don't need to receive attitude from a receptionist.  Clearly, they don't  need my business."
"1","I brought my sick kitty here who was vomitting and had diahhrea for a few days and the Dr we saw was like \""so what do you want to do\"" and I was thinking well thats why I am here to ask for your professional advise. I felt like I spent $100 for absolutely nothing. I would not recommend this clinic for any legit issues, I am sure they are fine for a vaccination or routine check up but I would never allow them to treat one my sick babies. I had taken my lil girl to the AVETS clinic over the holiday and they stabilized her and asked us to F/U with a primary Vet (clearly something significant was going on), the visit I had was a total sham I felt it was useless and I found a new Vet to care for my lil ones."
"2","Living near Groceria Italiana is like having my Italian family nearby.  Easy access to excellent food.  Homemade pasta, sauce, desserts, etc.\n\nTheir ready to eat food is delicious.  There is no reason a meatball sub should be a weekly part of my diet - but I can't help myself.  \n\nEveryone that works there is so helpful.  I've had a few parties catered by them - and they were overwhelmingly gracious.  \n\nI highly recommend stopping in this place to grab dinner - either for ready made food or their pasta and sauce.  You're about 10 minutes away from deliciousness."
"2","It's a nice small and authentic market that's just one block off the main strip. I absolutely love this place! If you come at the right time, you'll be able to see the fresh ravioli being made right in front of you."
"2","I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken it's toll on my waist line, truth be told). Two separate and delicious family owned Italian grocery stores and countless amazing restaurants.\n\nGroceria Italiana is one of those quintessential corner stores that make you think of the way things may have been when your parents were young.\n\nIf you're one of those on the go-doing a million things at once types who rarely find the time to cook a meal, look no further than the hot food options they offer. It's that perfect delicious comfort food that these up coming autumn days.\n\nSkip out of work early and make a pit stop here on your way home, you'll thank me later."
"1","I had such high hopes. And though they clearly pride themselves in their pasta and ravioli, mine fell apart like crazy. It was a mess. An expensive mess. Artichoke and Gorgonzola everywhere. Not only the seams fell apart. The pasta broke all over. I may go back for tiramisu in time, but I'll definitely hesitate before spending 9 bucks on a dozen pieces of watery mess again."
"2","Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked not boiled.) My favorite is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely pasta making ladies. Make certain to use the homemade sauce as well, we're talking heavenly good. Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, fresh Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I dream of this bread. The deli counter is as well fantastic, get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!"
"2","Love the fish sandwiches, they are all they are cracked up to be.  If you want lunch - try a sandwich here - but order ahead for pick up, or be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more in a shady looking bar.  The bar is very smoky, although it is also stocked with a soda machine if you get thirsty waiting for your sandwich to be made.   Although for a fish sandwich and fries you'll probably drop about $10, I think its definitely worth it."
"1","I walked in to try the fish sandwich that I have heard so much about but decided not to stay. The smell of smoke is over powering.  If your not a chain smoker, opt for takeout."
"1","The bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky. You'll definitely feel like you're in the deepest hole in the way. The only good thing is that the drinks are cheap. But I really wouldn't recommend going there."
"1","Yes, the fish was good. However, the restaurant was dirty, the bathroom smelled so awful that I could not go in it. The waitress was RUDE, CRUDE, and downright  OBNOXIOUS!!!!  Was the fish good enough for me to ever go back - NEVER!!!!!!!!"
"2","Sandwich lives up to the hype! The cornmeal breading is phenomenal and it isn't greasy like some others.\n\nAs of 07/2014 food service stops at 7 PM on Friday. The sign looks like the one pictured but with a giant black 7 over the kitchen closing hour for Friday so I'd guess all the other hours are the same (I didn't take a very good look as I was focused on the deliciousness before me)."
"2","Friendly, kind staff and good service.  I'll go here again and again, for eat-in or take-out.  I don't really have any favorites here...everything is tasty!"
"2","Love this place. And they have coupons too. The bonus is definitely the amount of food, you get enough for delicious lunch leftovers!"
"2","It's nice to know that there's decent Indian food that isn't far out in the boonies like Udipi (which, btw, is worth the trip).  I can't say I thought the restaurant aesthetics were that fantastic.  The acoustics in there are horrible, and it seems kind of dark.  But the service was nice, and the food is great.  Beware the stairs of death when you go to the bathroom.\n\nI haven't seen Chicken Muglai in years (they call it Muglai Korma on the menu) and the version they have is excellent.  We also had the sag paneer and a number of other dishes I can't even remember.  All I can recall is that I got my chicken muglai and it was GOOD.  The rest was good too.  I should also note that the portions are pretty large by Indian restaurant standards.  One dish goes a LONG way.\n\nThe nan is a little eh.  A little overcooked, in my estimation.  The garlic nan had lots of garlic on it but little garlic taste.  So, you get all the downside without any of the upside.  Too bad.\n\nIn any case, I will most definitely be coming back.  I"
"2","Tried the vegetarian thali ($12ish) and was really impressed by the quality, variety, and spiciness to order.  Will head back here with a smile."
"1","I had high hopes for Taste of India, after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star."
"1","5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \""8\"" really pop with flavor."
"2","Food from the motherland is a weakness of mine so despite good feedback from some friends, I tried to resist coming here when I first moved to Lawrenceville. So much for that!\n\nTaste of India is flat out great. Prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is simple and tastefully done (unlike another restaurant in Oakland, cough cough).\n\nThe staff are courteous and accommodating. I called out for take-out one night and when I walked up to the restaurant, I found that they had mixed up my order and I'd have to wait a few more minutes. As an apology for waiting, they threw in free samosas! (btw, the samosas here are delicious). Rest assured, this isn't a regular occurrence; the next time I ordered from here, the order was promptly ready.\n\nThe tandoori is very good. The chicken tikka masala is nice and creamy with good flavor. The palak paneer is also delicious. My taste buds are very happy to have found good Indian take-out within the city limits. (My waist-line is NOT pleased)."
"2","Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.\n\nThank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!\n\nI ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.\n\nWe also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in."
"1","I tried to eat here tonight using a $25 gift certificate purchased from Restaurant.com.  After waiting over 15 minutes for my server to stop by for my order, I showed her my gift certificate.  She told me they stopped taking them, however I had just purchased it 15 minutes earlier.  \n\nI spoke to the manager and he wasn't the least bit interested.  He told me Restaurant.com was a scam (I have used it before with no problems) and he hasn't been able to get in touch with them to cancel.  While I was still talking to him, he answered a call on his cell phone without even saying excuse me.  He obviously didn't care at all.\n\nI called Restaurant.com for a refund, and told them what he said.  They told me that they have actually been trying to get in touch with the restaurant for weeks.  I can only assume he owes them money or something.  Either way, it is outrageous that he will not honor a gift certificate for a program he agreed to sign up for.\n\nBeyond this problem, I can't recommend this place simply based on how awfully they dealt with this issue.  I didn't get a chance to try any food and I never will."
"2","Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around."
"2","This was my first time at taste of India. The service was very pleasant and I found the food and alcoholic beverages to be quite inexpensive. Most importantly, the food was fantastic. The flavors were well balanced and succulent. I will definitely be coming around more often."
"2","It was more expensive than other Indian places I've been to, but it was good!  We did takeout and they gave us a ton of rice and I order way too much naan.  It was $65 for four of us.  \n I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and I loved it, my wife got the Chicken Curry, also very good.  The other couple got a shrimp dish and a tilapia dish, which I tried but didn't care for.  I would never have ordered those dishes anyway so I won't count that against them.\nI would like to try lunch here - I saw a buffet table, so that might be a more cost efficient choice for this place."
"2","Buffet, while small is totally worth it. Has all the essentials!"
"1","If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back."
"2","This is the restaurant where I bring people when I want to impress them with the great Indian food in Pittsburgh - twice now, I've gotten the special meal for two, and not only is it flavorful and well-spiced (I feel like they're great at matching the spice level you request - and other people dining with me agreed), it's a good value - so much food that you can easily make another meal out of the leftovers.\n\nThe lamb dishes are delicious; I've had the Boti-Kabab Masala and Lamb Sag, but I really enjoyed the vegetarian dish I had, Hariyali Handi (vegetables in spinach), so much so that I've had it both times and may not be able to stop myself from ordering it again. My real yardstick for greatness, though is the samosas: when you order the special meal, they come along as part of the deal - it would be easy to take less care with a \""throwaway\"" item, but they are quite simply the best samosas I have ever had, slightly spicy, super-crispy, and big enough to share.\n\nThe bill comes on a tiny tray filled with sugar crystals, caraway and coriander seeds and colorful bits of candy - I've seen similar combinations at other Indian restaurants, but it's artfully presented, and as with the rest of Taste of India, it leaves me charmed and satisfied, just as an excellent restaurant should."
"2","Not fancy but great Indian food at a really reasonable price. The eggplant was particularly yummy."
"2","I would have to say that this is some of the best Indian I've had in pittsburgh so far. The staff were friendly and attentive. \n\nThe chicken korma was delicious. It had almonds and raisins in it, which complemented the sauce nicely. \n\nThe check comes in a tray with candy coated fennel seeds. We didn't know it was edible until our server said to try some. I liked it because I like black licorice. Also, our server explained that it helps to cleanse the palette after a spicy meal. \n\nThe prices were on point. The seats and tables were new and comfortable."
"2","This place is awesome.  He was closed but was still there cleaning and took me in for a great old school cut.  I'd tried some salons and was relying on Sueprcuts a lot and hadn't been to a barber in quite some time.  Sure, I haven't had this kind of haircut since gradeschool, but he did clean it up quite nicely and even gave my beard a clean trim.  Definitely recommended if this is what you're looking for.  Also, some great conversation"
"2","I was desperately in need of a hair cut. Generally I had went to Hair friends in Oakland, who are great for styling hair in  a particular fashion , but quite pricey. I wanted a shorter, neat cut, and this shop was open. \n\nThe gentleman was very affable, and the atmosphere was pleasant. As others have stated, he does a very thorough, and quick hair cut. This is not Supercuts, folks, he knows how to cut hair. \n\nFunny guy too, I will return."
"2","I called in to see if I could squeeze an appointment in on the day of the call. He said he was pretty busy, but that I could swing by at 4:30pm. This place is a one-man-shop with two barber chairs, and I knew that going in. I'm pretty sure that he knows all of his repeat customers. I found out about this place from a friend who said that the guy who runs it is awesome, and the person getting his hair cut before I arrived was busy in good conversation when I arrived.\n\nAnyways, the hair cut was nice, what I wanted, quick, and $14, so not bad. I know nothing about cutting hair, but this guy undoubtedly has a technique he has honed. At the end, instead of using an electric razor to shave the back of my neck, he used a straight razor with warm shaving cream.\n\nI'm going to keep coming to this place because I like the traditional feel and the familiar atmosphere."
"2","Great conversationalist, inexpensive and high quality hair cuts, wonderful old school atmosphere. No computers, no expensive hair products they're trying to hawk, just a man doing his craft. Every time I go there I'm so happy this place is still thriving."
"2","My husband comes here to get his hair and beard trimmed. I am always happy with the result. that simple. :)\n\nA couple of times I have accompanied him to the Golden Razor and have always found Tom to be accommodating, very friendly, efficient and professional. He is also so kind to my daughter - who loves to go with daddy to get his hair cut. \n\nI could not recommend him enough. My husband always has a great experience there and holds a very high opinion of Tom.  \n\nHe takes appointments and even though the man is very busy he will try to accommodate walk-ins but I would suggest you call ahead first."
"1","I'm a pretty hard core karaoke fan, so I was excited to visit Nico's on a Saturday night after hearing about their awesome karaoke. Sadly, I was disappointed. The place is rather small and was packed by the time we came (about 10pm). It took ages to get a drink and it's hard to get around the bar with so many people standing around. That said, my drink was nice and strong and the prices are reasonable. \n\nNow the karaoke crowd was pretty fun...mostly hipsters with a few good singers but mostly people trying to be funny with their song choice. The karaoke host was just lame. He was an older guy, and seemed rather cranky and jaded, which really kills the mood when you're a karaoke buff looking for a good time. And he had a CD setup -- seriously, CDs, in 2010. His song list was waaaaaay out of date. He had a tiny TV screen that was setup in such a way that if you needed to look at the words, you would be facing away from the crowd. It was just really lackluster in my opinion."
"1","This will be simple...\nThe karaoke had a very limited selection. \nThe DJ kept fiddling with the volume while you were singing. \nWas way over-crowded with wanna-be hipsters who were attempting to be ironic which just made them look pathetic, especially since they kept taking pictures to most likely show Facebook people how much fun they were having and how great they are.\nThere was only one server for a bar packed with people and was hard to get a drink.\n\nWon't be going back."
"2","Bloomfield has some hidden gems and Nico's is one of those kind of places that is getting less and less common around the 'burgh. It's not a gastropub, it's not bohemian, Nico's is just an old time bar/restaurant that makes me nostalgic for a time before I was even born. \n\nI always come here on Monday nights for the wing special. It's something like 24 wings for 8 bucks which is not a bad deal. There are definitely better wings around the city, but I still keep coming back to Nico's. Maybe it has to do with the friendly atmosphere (seems to be a family run place), and the divey feel. The location is great as it just pops up in the middle of a residential section in the heart of Bloomfield.\n\nThe patrons are always friendly, and on more than one occasion I've had random people start chatting me up like we've known each other for years. If you are feeling adventurous try out karaoke night on Saturdays, its always good for some laughs and fun times.\n\nLong live the old school joints in Pittsburgh, I hope you last forever."
"2","This is a friendly, hipsters-and-yinzers-living-in-harmony kind of joint. Sports on the TVs, Yeungling on tap--quintessential Pittsburgh. The fried fish (with fries and coleslaw) is Lenten-Catholic quality. If I minded cigarette smoke, this place would be a four; but since I don't, perfect score. Like Scorpion once intoned...\""Get over here!\"""
"1","Pay attention to the bill.\n\nCurly haired male bartender intentionally added $20 of drinks to my tab. When I confronted him he blamed the extra drinks on my friends who hadn't been drinking those things in the first place."
"1","I don't understand why people love this place. I've been here a dozen times.\n\nThe beer selection is decent. The prices are good.  The bar food is typical.\n\nIt is just a standard bar to me.  If you want no frills beer and bar food, they are no frills."
"2","Favorite local bar! The service is great, owner is on top of everything and her staff is always helpful and friendly. Great karaoke on Saturday nights, Pirates game specials and Meatloaf of Tuesdays is to die for!"
"1","I was walking my small granddaughter (not yet two) and when I passed I decided to go in to pick up some shrimp for my son.  I waited quite a bit of time in line for the shrimp, then again to check out.  When I checked out the woman at the register told me that they did not accept cards for purchases under $5 and since I had no money with me I told her I couldn't get the shrimp.  THERE IS NO SIGN ON THE DOOR STATING THIS OR I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED MY TIME OR MY GRANDCHILD'S IMPATIENCE GETTING THE PRODUCT.  PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR SO PEOPLE CAN EITHER PASS BY YOUR STORE OR GO TO THE BANK ATM PRIOR TO ENTERING.  I will not be back (the woman was rude).  I have been there before, making much larger purchases, but never have been aware of the restriction.  PUT A SIGN ON YOUR DOOR WHEN THERE ARE STORE CONDITIONS I LOOKED FOR ONE ON ENTERING.  Restrictions are understandable, just not when you fail to publish them and I waste my time."
"1","I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap, the premade foods like crab raviolis are delicious, and they have awesome chocolate covered pretzels and biscotti.\nThen I saw one of the deli members drop meat on the floor, pick it up, and stick it right back in the case! Also, a whole tray of meatballs and sauce from the hot bar was spilled all over the floor. They just scooped it right back in and I only hope it wasn't served! The place smells awful and the workers are grumpy. There's a lady there who's always screaming and cursing and some fat guy that's just as bad. The LAST experience I had with Donatelli's was when I bought a tub of \""freshly packed\"" soynuts. I got home, cracked a brew, and reached into my beer snack to find a WORM!!! If you value your health as I do, do not eat anything from Donatelli's that  was packed there."
"1","Jane is so right. The food and prices may be great, but who wants to eat dirt with it? I've seen someone mop the filthy snow tracked floor then put the bucket of water on the deli counter. No thanks. I'll pay a little more for sanitation. There are other Italian grocery stores close by."
"2","Whenever I'm in Bloomfield, I've gotta stop in at Donatelli's.  Okay, Donatelli's was my primary reason for going to Bloomfield the other day.  I had to pick up a few of the usual staples.  Our fridge was getting mighty low on mozzarella, provolone, and Italian lunch meats (the salami was on special, BTW!).  Ditto for our pantry--It was getting a little shy on the fine imported pastas, biscottis, etc.  Gotta restock!"
"2","Yet another review for Donatelli's?  \n\nWell let's take a look at the January specials.  Imported Polish ham for $3.99 lb.  Polish ham at an Italian store?  Okay!  Fresh homemade pasta for $2.49 lb!  Gonna be having some veal tortellini with spicy Italian sausage and my homemade marinara sauce for dinner tonight.  Nicholas coffee for $6.99 lib.  We all know that Susan doesn't resume the form of a human female until she's had that 2nd cup."
"2","After visiting Donatelli's today as part of a Yelp Event, my husband and I returned to purchase Cheese Ravioli, Grandma's Plain Sauce, and Chocolate-Covered Almond Biscotti for dinner. After having tried all three this evening, I can definitely recommend Donatelli's food and look forward to having these items again!"
"1","I RUSHED to tan today after work. I got to Yolanda's at 7:20PM, only to find that the salon was closed. Both the sign on the door and the listed hours on the website state that Yolanda's tanning side is open until 8pm. I'm pretty pissed that I wasted time driving the whole way from Monroeville to Bloomfield for nothing. I've spent money on (multiple) tanning packages here, but I will definitely be taking my sad, untanned booty somewhere more reliable from now on."
"1","Four star food, three star service, and two star ambience.\n\nWent in, got the stink-eye from two or three folks sitting at the bar watching the hockey game.  Sat in the dining room, and it was spooky quiet; for the first half of our meal, no one else was there, there wasn't music, and the only other sounds came from the next room, which just felt odd.  Atmosphere was bad.\n\nGot the pasta roll, which was absolutely delicious; awesome pasta/pine nuts/spinach under a relatively light red cream sauce.  The salad I had was lackluster, though; wilted greens, dry shredded carrots, and a pepperoncini that was just off; it tasted bitter, which was an all-new, all-bad taste for those.  Ew.  Five star entree, two star salad, maybe.\n\nThere were two waitresses and only two tables; refills on water were pretty quick up front (several times), but we wound up hanging out for five or ten minutes after we were done eating before seeing our waitress again.\n\nTwo and a half stars?  I'd stop in and get a pasta roll for take-out, maybe, but there's a lot of competition for selling red-sauce italian food in the Italian neighborhood, ya know?"
"1","If you wanna see local color, come to D'Amicos. If you wanna get a stiff drink in the middle of the afternoon while walking around with a bandage on your face and wanna fly under the radar (true story), come to D'Amico's. This place is absolutely no bells or whistles, the waitresses are loud, and the stale sent of grease and old liquor hangs in the air. All the way down to the cracked teal vinyl seats, this place is legit.  \n\nD'Amico's just don't give a s**t.\n\nBut it's all good. Having traveled quite a bit, I often find placees like this refreshing. The Wedding Soup is comforting and they are generous with the bread. And....they have no judgements about the previously mentioned strong drink that I consumed at 2:37pm on a Friday afternoon."
"1","D'Amico's is like...Olive Garden, only less festive and with more \""local color.\""  We came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\n\nOur server was definitely \""set in her ways,\"" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \""does not compute\"" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \""...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\"" and I was all \""yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\"" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \""oh, do you need a list or something?\""  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\n\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\n\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \""meh\"" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\n\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.  For all the Italian folks around here, I'm sure Pittsburgh must have way better Italian food offerings than this."
"2","I live right around the corner, so I've been here a couple times. The atmosphere is local, and the service is friendly and attentive. What wins this place 5*s  is the food - some of the best italian food I've ever had! Pasta, gnocci... even the salads have been delicious. The bar is beautiful as well. It looks very old but in a good way. I was so surprised by this place - it's one of those Bloomfield gems that I was very happy to discover."
"1","Damicos has been closed since December 2012"
"2","Hole in the wall - check.  Stern (at times) owner who rules his roost - check.\n\nI don't really trust a Vitnamese restaurant to be really really good unless it is a hole in the wall kind of place.   :)  And this place is good.  Now, my one beef with this restaurant is the limited menu.  But really, they do everything on the menu so well that you can't really complain.  And the prices are extremely reasonable.  Make sure you get the fresh rolls.  I usually get the vermicelli with a little bit of everything on top.  And unless you are ridiculously hungry, get the smaller bowl - it is still a lot of food.\n\nBYOB, so feel free to bring your own alcohol of choice.  I can't remember what the corkage fee is, probably because there is none, I believe.  And bring cash."
"1","Why do so many people in Pittsburgh love this place? The other day someone asked me... where's your favourite Vietnamese food? I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's. \n\nI don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints. \n\nI had their \""Special\"" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \""pre-mixed.\"" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \""Okay they have a different presentation style.\"" \n\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \n\nI don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.\n\nAfter reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\n\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke's on you."
"1","Like a couple others, I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about this place.  I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \""pork\"" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.  Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards."
"2","Like the owner. Informal atmosphere- almost Asian cafeteria style except the food is really good. Decor is a little disjointed. Cheap prices so I'm not complaining. Always fast service. Good place for a casual hang out w/ friends or a not-out-to-impress date. Do not add fish sauce to stuff- it almost ruined my Tram's proclivity forever.\n\nGood place to get a spicy hot soup in the winter if you're cold.\n\nSeems good for large groups. Cash only I think..."
"2","The first thing that charmed me about Tram's kitchen was the tablecloths. They are exactly like the tablecloths I saw in a little hole-in-the-wall restaurants throughout Vietnam. The decor is very similar to what you'd get in Vietnam, so if you don't like the decor, you probably should never go to Vietnam. \n\nIn terms of food, the service was quick, the food was piping hot and quite delicious. I was expecting more fresh herbs on the pho, but the complex broth more than made up for any lackings. \n\nI will definitely be heading back to this cheap, tasty hole-in-the wall."
"2","Cheap, tasty, filling.  We tried the pho, spring rolls, and lemongrass chicken; all were well worth ordering again.  This was, however, my first Vietnamese meal, so my thoughts are necessarily less discerning.  \n\nThe owner is indeed a character, and he more or less ordered for one of us.  Luckily, we're pretty easy going, and generally happy to take a proprietor's advice on what's good.  He struck me as amusing and endearing rather than abrasive.\n\nThe place was packed, though we went at 7 on a Friday.  Given this and the fact that they take no reservations, it'd probably be a hassle to go there with parties larger than 4."
"1","Meh. I was visiting from NYC when I ate here before a show at the Brillobox. The beef pho was sub par. Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that's a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth, and the bean sprouts had seen better days. The framed PPG review says Tram's has the best Pho in Pittsuburgh; if that's actually true, then the state of  Pho in Pittsburgh is in bad shape.\n\nI also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent, so plus one star for having vegetarian soups, and more importantly, actually trying to make it good. It beat the pants off of the veggie Viet place on 6th st. in NYC. I kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of \""vegetarian\"" though I kept that to myself...\n\nAs others have noted, the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly, but I wonder if there's some kind of inverse halo effect going on here. Some hole-in-the-walls are just that: a hole in the wall.\n\nAlso: $8 for Pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing."
"2","I do have a special place in my stomach for Tram's kitchen and I try to eat there every now and again.  Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.  The prices are cheap, the grub is good, and the place is uh... rustic, oh yeah, and bring cash!"
"2","Great pho and fresh spring rolls!"
"2","great place.  great food.  perfect spice level and it doesn't interfere with the flavor.  had an everything bowl with vermicelli and some egg rolls.  very good.  quick for lunch too.   excellent pricing.  cant wait to eat here again."
"1","If you have been to any other PHO restaurant, in any other city, Tram's Kitchen would be OUT OF BUSINESS! \n\nFor starters, the portion of the PHO is extremely SKIMPY! I don't think we have had such a small portion of PHO since we were Babies! Seriously, would it kill you to add more rice noodles? \n\nSince we had the PHO as our Appetizers, we then ordered the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid for Seafood...but all we got were vegetables and some imitation they call seafood. What a Joke! \n\nSuggestion if you plan on going here. Come FULL and just order the Spring Roll."
"2","This place isn't much to look at, but when the I'm talking about a restaurant ambiance falls second to good food. The pho here is great. Really flavorful with a great balance of ingredients. I need to go back and try the Bun."
"2","stop 4 on our 7 state pho tour - and everything else you read is true.\n\nmy thoughts were like this...\nsmall, border line clean, authentic, no tripe?, took forever to get food on the table, excellent pho, nice little place."
"1","I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday.  Let me tell you, this place is a big let down.  I don't know why people are giving it such rave reviews.  All my Viet friends in this city also avoid this place because it really is NOT good.  \n\nThe portions are tiny, and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied.  It lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have.  I've had pho at home and in 30+ different pho restaurants and this was probably in my top 5 most disappointing.  As for the other dishes, it comes to the table looking like someone already ate it or like a jumbled mess.\n\nThis is aside from the service..I actually like the old man that works there...he's the only reason I give it two stars."
"1","I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must, be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.\n\nI started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  \n\nNext visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.  So HIGHLY disappointed with my Pho experience."
"2","They have the best Pho (I get the vegetarian version), vegetarian spring rolls and tofu w lemongrass. Those are the only things I order there bc they are so delicious I can't bare to order anything else.  It's not the best atmosphere, but the food is delicious.. and that's what you go to a restaurant for!!"
"1","Visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and wanted some Vietnamese so we stopped by here expecting to find the best pho in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant. The menu is small with very limited choices. Service is minimal. \n\nWe ordered some spring roll appetizer which was pretty good. Then we had 3 different kind of pho for our main entree. We ordered a \""sate\"" soup, a Saigon soup and a pho Hanoi soup. Only decent one was the pho Hanoi soup which isn't really like the typical pho. No beef tripe, tendon or beef balls in the soup and the noodles are fatter then what you'd find in typical pho. There was also excessive MSG in the soup dishes."
"2","awesome vermicelli with coconut milk. if i lived around here i would eat at tram's every day. actually, i live in san francisco, which (obviously) has excellent restaurants, many of them vietnamese. i would put tram's up against any of them, any day of the week."
"1","I've been to Tram's several times, always hoping for a better experience, and more importantly, better food.  I eventually gave up.  The food tends to be bland, the owner brusque, and with Pho Minh just up the street, I find myself going there when I'm craving a hot bowl of pho on a cold Pittsburgh winter night.\n\nFood highlights - \n   None that I can really think of.  The food is cheap.\n\nFood cons - \n   The component that makes or breaks a bowl of pho is the broth.  It is the one thing that must be good for the soup to be enjoyable.  I've never had any hint of real flavor from the broth itself (before you add the plum sauce and the srirachia and basil and lime).  This is something that Tram's has gotten badly wrong every time I visited."
"2","Although everyone comes here for the pho, i also like the fried rice and the egg noodles with tofu yummy! yummy!"
"2","I don't know how other reviewers compare Trams to Pho Minh.  Pho Minh is disgusting and uses a very tasteless powder broth/soup base for their pho.  Pho Minh is a lot closer to the real deal, but their pho selection is really small.\n\nThis has been the best bowl of pho I've had in Pittsburgh, and the four stars is totally relative for the 'burgh."
"1","Trams has Vietnamese food and it's in Pittsburgh.  So if you're craving spring rolls with peanut sauce or vermicelli with fish sauce and fresh herbs, this is the place to go if you're in Pittsburgh.  Be forewarned - if you've had Vietnamese food from places with large Vietnamese populations, Trams satisfies an urge but it's definitely not the greatest.  They're stingy with the herbs and the peanut sauce; a bit on the expensive side for this kind of food (especially for being such a dive); the pork is dry; and the vermicelli bowls are pre-mixed - even the fish sauce has already been dumped in."
"1","I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \n\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings."
"2","I am from Houston, since I came here I've been searching for the perfect bowl of pho. I have to say this is the closest thing yet from home!!! Good pho with fair pricing, doesn't get ebtter than this."
"2","Darren and I came here last weekend, and I liked it very much. The \""Saigon Soup\"" was sssoooooo goood! I couldn't finish it! The portion was so generous. I also liked their egg rolls and the sauce that came with them. The owner was nice to us but doesn't play around! You have to order fast because the place is always full! I appreciated how he found a table and some chairs to seat us even though they were superbusy. I love Asian food, and now I have another place to enjoy.\n\nI didn't mind the decor, and the place isn't \""dirty\"" either. What do people expect? The Le Mont?"
"1","I don't see the hype. Bad service, bland food."
"1","Went here last weekend with friends. Two of us became violently ill with food poisoning. Ordinarily, I would recommend the spring rolls and the pho, of course, but since my trip to the ER, I won't be back here again."
"1","Don't believe the hype.\n\nWas in the Pittsburgh area for one day and decided to try the pho here.  It was a toss up between Pho Minh and here.  I think I chose wrong.\n\nA rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went, all I saw were non-Asians.  \n\nOrdered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable. It did not taste flavorful and authentic but maybe that's what is available in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnother sour note, they dropped off some spring rolls at our table.  It was our first time there and I thought they were complimentary so we ate them.\n\nLater on, we saw them on our bill.  WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM.\n\nThey were overpriced, and not worth it.\n\nBe careful if they drop off food or drinks at your table, they will bill you for it afterwards even if you didn't order it."
"2","This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment, you'd better stop here. It's a hole in the wall by a seemingly angry asian (he's actually quite nice). Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.\n\nWith that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.\n\nSpring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only. There's an ATM at the entrance or any of the nearby gas stations."
"2","The food here was awesome.  Get some"
"1","I really want to give this place more stars but the food at Pho Van is so much better. Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking, and it also feels like home with the owner's kids running around. \n\nBut the bun thit nuong (pork vermicelli) was pretty sub-par, even with my already low expectations for a Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh (we're Vietnamese from Cali so our expectations are usually really high!). The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones). \n\nThe waiter/owner(?) is really sweet, and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong. I'll try this place once more and hope to give it a better review next time!"
"2","My favorite pho resturant in town the fresh rolls are great the pho is very tasty.  The prices are good and the food is great."
"2","if you're going out to vietnamese for the food, go here. if you're going out for the ambiance, go somewhere else. when you walk into tram's, you'll be seated and handed menus and approximately 45 seconds later be asked if you're ready to order yet. the staff is pretty get-in-get-out-get-going style. it is byob though, which is pretty cool too.\ni ordered the beef pho soup. i really enjoyed it. like i said, if you're going for the food itself, you should definitely check this place out, it's pretty damn good."
"2","I came here once and ordered pho, and I was very disappointed. Bland broth, tough meat, I didn't get the Tram's hype. Not that I've ever tried mind-blowing pho (I've only eaten it in Pennsylvania, which is probably the problem) but this was even worse than most.\n\nHowever, I've since been back and ordered the bun. Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.\n\nI do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality.\n\nRegardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!!"
"2","GREAT FOOD!  Like the other reviews - you will not be disappointed by the fresh spring rolls.  Best I've had in the city.  The only part of our experience I wish I cloud have changed was the ordering process.  We weren't really sure what any of the dish's were, and the server offered no clarification.  My boyfriend was so flustered he just ordered by number and ended up with two entrees!  It was pretty funny.  Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  We will definitely be going back (with a bit more knowledge of the menu)!"
"2","If you can get past its humble appearance, Tram's Kitchen has the best pho and fresh spring rolls in Pittsburgh. \n\nThe restaurant, which is owned and operated by a family of Vietnamese immigrants that left the old country in the early 1990s, is very down to earth and low key.\n\nThe service is primarily provided by Tram's father, who has one hand but somehow manages to seat, take your order, pour/refill your water, brings your food, clear the table and cash you out. He can be moody at times, but I have never found him to be rude even on a bad or busy day (he probably just doesn't have time for slowpokes who can't make up their mind). I would cut him some slack if he doesn't appear to be the most patient person in the world. \n\nParking in Lawrenceville can be iffy at times, but if you drive west a few blocks past Tram's there are usually many streetside spots. Cash only. BYOB."
"1","1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting\n2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to, but still good."
"1","Being Vietnamese I've had tried tons of Vietnamese Pho restaurants and Tram's has to be one of the worse place I've ever been to. The food was mediocre and full of MSG. I ordered a rice vermicelli dish with egg rolls and they were oily and greasy. The Pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty. \n\nMy total bill doesn't reflect the price of the dishes I ordered. My bill came out to be higher than what's listed on the menu. Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time, they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night. \n\nAlthough the old man at the place is nice, this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking."
"1","Location:4050 Penn Ave Pittsburgh\nPrice: $ 1/2\nService: Good\n\nMy family was really hungry and everywhere my parents visit they always want to try native food. So, I search Viet restaurant on the GPS and it lead us there- I mean if it was apart of the GPS' top 10 it must be good. I feel like being Vietnamese made me more critical on the food when I do go to Vietnamese restaurants. \n\nIt is in a residental neighbourhood downtown.You're able to park along the streets. It was a very humble environment and very cute. The service was okay, they were really nice and never rude. \n\nWe ordered Pho (of course...), com tam, pad thai, and bun. It all tasted plain;the Pho was a little off, the pad thai wasn't spicy or had enough of the sweet/sour taste to it. The portions were really small. I definitely feel like my GPS lied to me and that I've experienced better."
"2","Love the Hanoi Pho and spring roll. Nice plump shrimp too. Do yourself a favor...it's far from a fashion spot, just real good eats. Reminds of what SF's Tenderloin excellent Cambodian and Vietnamese were back before everything cost an arm n a leg."
"1","If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places, you're not going to be impressed by Tram's.\n\nI gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times. I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn't prepared to spend that much for what's supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.\n\nEither way, I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.\n\nThe vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that's fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.\n\nFolks who dine at Tram's should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid's, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram's). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I've tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram's would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.\n\nIf none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don't have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \""small eats.\"" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs."
"2","The best Vietnamese I have tried in Pittsburgh. The Tufu lemon from the appetizers was just perfect. I found the place from Yelp.com and I would definitely recommend it! Very inexpensive too! I really like it!"
"1","It's about 2.5. We live in Squirrel Hill with a lot of good restaurants and I thought this place is better than where we usually go. The pho is the cheapest in Pittsburgh but the portion is very small. The spring roll is the most expensive vietnamese spring roll. \nI ordered the Saigon soup for myself and #17 for my husband. My husband likes it because he is an america and like sweet stuff. Everything with coconut is good for him. These dishes we got doesn't look like what they showed on the photo. The Vietnamese place in Squirrel hill or the stripe is a lot better."
"2","This is my go-to place for Pho. I normally get take out since I live in the area, but sitting here is quite an experience too. This is authentic Vietnamese food. \n\nHighly recommend to anyone looking for some good Pho."
"1","First of all, Tram's has been cited by the Allegheny Health Department for code violations like not storing meat at proper temperatures. I also personally know several people who have gotten violently ill from eating there. If that's not enough to stop you, read on.\n\nI feel like people who like this place are confusing \""dirty & mean\"" with authentic. The staff are unpleasant and it doesn't feel like a place you'd want someone cooking food. \n\nAnd finally, sure, all of this could be different if the food was good, but in my opinion, it is not. Bland and disappointing, the Pho most of all. Pittsburgh has so many great asian restaurants, including other Vietnamese options, that I don't see any reason to eat here."
"2","For starters I had a fresh spring roll and a fried egg roll. The fresh spring roll is big and stuffed with shrimp, shredded pork, lettuce, basil, and rice. It was probably a sixth of the size of a chipotle burrito. The fried egg roll is a little smaller, yet it is still packed. I enjoyed the fried egg roll way more, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying Tram's fresh spring roll.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Vermicelli noodles with coconut milk and beef. It was sweet and savory, but it missed a kick of spiciness to counter the coconut milk. I asked the staff for crushed red chili pepper flakes, but there was a significant language barrier which impeded me from conveying my request. Eventually, I said pepper enough, and I was brought jalape\u00f1o peppers. Not quite what I was looking for but they were an acceptable alternative.\n\nThe only subpar point of the night was the difficulty with service. The cash only policy could have been trouble; luckily, I read some reviews beforehand which prepared me. Also note that Tram's lets you BYOB."
"2","Delicious.  Side benefit:  cheap.  We got the pork chop split rice and the pork sate pho.  Both were good.  Service is prompt and efficient. Cash only."
"2","I stopped by here this past Wednesday evening for dinner with my fiance.   We have both been to Tram's before but it has been awhile since our last visit.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant we saw that not much has changed except for maybe the addition of a flat screen TV.  The restaurant itself is small and maybe has seating at tables for about 30 people and the decorations are a little sparse.  The easiest thing to see is that they have won a ton of awards which are hanging up on the back wall.  Beyond that it is still a hole in the wall divey type of place that is cash-only with excellent food.  \n \nAlmost immediately after we sat down the owner asked us if we were ready to order.  At that point we were not ready.  The menu here isn't that big but it doesn't need to be since what they do make is very good.  About two minutes later the owner was back and ready to take our order.  This time we were ready.  My fiance and I decided to split some eggrolls and then for my entree I went with the beef vermicelli with conconut milk.\nThe eggrolls came out at the same time as the meals and were so hot temperature wise that both my fiance and myself left them until after we had eaten our entrees.  My vermicelli ended up being really good with the sauce providing the perfect flavor to the dish.  I don't know how they do it but they do a great job of infusing a ton of flavors into it.  The noodles in it were also good and the beef was better than expected.  After I had finished my vermicelli I ended up grabbing my eggrolll which was still somehow hot.  While the flavor on it wasn't that great, what I really loved about it was the textures that it provided.  It was cooked perfectly and so the shell had a great crispy exterior while the interior with the vegetables had a softer texture.  Overall it was another solid meal at Tram's for me.\n \nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.   Whats not to like about a place where the food is not only cheap but also delicious?  Just be careful in that it is cash only and I know at one point they were BYOB although I am not sure if that is still the case."
"1","I came here awhile ago and ordered one of the rice-based dishes with chicken (can't remember exactly what it was, and there's no menu posted online for me to figure it out).  The dish was dry and lacked flavor.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish here, since the Pho seems to be what they're known for.  As it were, I wasn't impressed. I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St."
"1","I was born and raised eating Pho and this honestly was the blandest I've had. Then, to mask the bland no taste of the soup, it was smothered in black pepper. On top of that, my meatballs were quite dry, even in soup.\n\nHowever, their spring rolls were great!\n\nThe service, was not the best. We were seated and then grunted at (literally) to take our order. From there, people who were seated after us, had their food before we did. They had a very similar order to ours. Then, when I did receive my food, the man hovered near me and then started pouring sauce onto my plate, telling me how to make my pho. I know how to make it! And even if I did need help, I was barely just given my bowl and getting my bean sprouts in first. Give me a second.\n\nI had high hopes based on the reviews, but unfortunately, I don't see myself coming back here again."
"2","I had the fresh spring rolls and the pho, both are great.\n\nConsidering prices of all restaurants in Pitt, the prices here are very nice! For a large pho, it was $7-8. Spring rolls were $1.50 each.\n\nThings to note: cash only\n\nAlso, you can get the pho with beef, chicken, or meatballs. You get a nice portion, but the pho does not include tripe, tendon, flank, and other random meats you'd normally get with your pho elsewhere. \n\nBesides this, broth was excellent and portion/taste was great."
"2","I love this place.  The vermicelli is amazing.  It is a cozy hole in the wall.  The food is so good.  And it's BYOB."
"1","Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries, and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger!  A great place to be drunk in, not so great to be hung over in...  They have your typical greasy spoon fare, so don't go if you're concerned about your health.  Otherwise, eat on brave soul, eat on!"
"1","I've only been here after 2 AM, and it's always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience.\n\nI've had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job, I've had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food, and I've witnessed an armed robbery.  The food is decent, for the hours they're open.  \n\nTry Tom's Diner or Eat 'n Park instead.  Heck, go to a grocery store instead."
"2","A Pittsburgh classic.  Many, many late nights have I spent here, post strike party, or any other type party, eating the grease necessary to fight off the hangover I deserved the next day.  The waitresses are part of the ambiance.  Love their Reuben."
"2","Okay, the food isn't wonderful -- but, it's pretty good AND it's cheap! I must admit I always stick with the breakfast-y menu items, but I'm such a fan of this place!\nYou gotta appreciate Ritter's being open 24 hours. Where else in Pittsburgh can you go at 2 AM and get some comfort food (or something to sober you up)? I've been here at all hours of the day, and the crowd is always interesting... and so are the waitresses.  Ah, I love it! There's just something special about Ritter's."
"2","Ritters is, for me, the definition of a diner.  If you go early an old grandmother will serve up a sloppy egg breakfast on plates that you can't be sure if they've been washed more than twice.  Go late night and you can join drunk college kids and \""the ladies of the evening\"", just be warned that someone may have painted a section of the restroom with a fine layer of regergitated food (\""hey, is that creamed corn\"").\n\nSay what you will about Ritters, it is a place full of character and full of characters.  Not to be missed."
"2","Quintessential diner complete with in-booth mini-jukeboxes, waitresses in diner aprons and cheap, good, simple food.\n\nGo early, go late, go REAL late - it's ALWAYS open.\n\nLocated on the borders of Shadyside, South Oakland, Friendship and Bloomfield it serves the likes of college students as well as the eldery.\n\nUsed to live around the corner from it and went weekly."
"1","The food isn't something to rave about but it's edible. I love the fact that they offer fried green tomatoes and grape leaves. I have only been to (C)Ritters for late night munchies and that also happens to be when Pittsburgh's finest come out to play. Never a dull moment."
"1","Finding a good ol' diner in Pittsburgh isn't exactly easy. Pamela's has great breakfast, but is in no sense a diner, and there are many good sandwich shops, but once again, they aren't diners.\n\nHaving only been there once so far, my review may be a little skewed. The restaurant has the diner feel, no doubt. There are jukebox machines at every table up front and the decorations harken to the setting of a greasy spoon restaurant.\n\nIt was busy when we went, so the food took a while. The wait seemed longer than it should have been, but as I said, the place was packed and it was exactly lunchtime. On the menu it stated that they used \""premium maple syrup\"", but I'm pretty sure I just got corn syrup in a cup. The coffee was somewhat watery but still alright.\n\nI ordered the french toast with eggs and bacon, all of which was rather bland (Except the bacon, a meat which has some inherent godliness to it. You can't mess it up). Basically, it seemed like a meal I could have whipped up lazily on my own, and in less time. The bread for the french toast was plain white toast and I normally prefer a better bread. The eggs were eggs: good without any pizzazz.\n\nWhile Ritters is cheap, from my small sampling, I found the food boring. Most good diners have some excellent menu item, and perhaps I drew the short straw. I might return to Ritters later, but it's certainly not the diner I'm looking for."
"1","At 2am on a weekend night, the clientele is colorful, the service friendly and the food...well just forget about the food.  The food ranges from mediocre to bland.  Just be grateful there is a colorful place to go for a late night meal."
"1","Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice, never my choice, I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with non-gourmet food, but Ritter's, is just \""blah\"". It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around. \nThey are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas, because the food is oh so delish. Here, you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement."
"1","I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place, so after 4 months I did.  When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection. \n\nThe food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know.\n\nWhen the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).\n\nWife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast.\n\nI never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot.\n\nTerribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded."
"1","2.5 but I rounded down.\nThis is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.\nI'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one.\nFood is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses."
"1","I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything, but there is a reason why I didn't order anything.\n\nMy brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling. Being the responsible little sister, I \""chaperoned\"" the boys and went the Ritters with them. I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight, but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner, I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise, his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.\n\nTrust your eyes, nose, and instinct. It's most likely right."
"2","Although it's called a diner, it's much larger than that.  It's open 24/7 and has a full menu.  Tough to fault, especially with good food."
"2","Fantastic service, incredibly inexpensive, surprisingly tasty - that pretty much sums it up. As long as you come here knowing it is a cheap diner and not expecting something different, you will enjoy your experience. I had the spinach and feta omelet with tomato, which came with a side of hashbrowns. Each of these was great."
"2","Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.\n\nEveryone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty."
"1","The food at Ritter's tastes like I made it at home, and this is not an endorsement.  I had the feta and tomato omelet, and it tasted skunked, like it had just been cooked in a dirty skillet.\n\nIt's a dirty diner with meh food, but it is open 24 hours.  If you're drunk, I bet the foood is great."
"2","They don't take credit cards (cash only), but damn do they have some good food! The server we had was funny as hell. It's just a good old fashioned diner that's open 24/7/365, and you can have whatever's on their menu 24/7/365! lol.\n\nEarly one recent morning (still getting caught up on reviews!), I had their fried chicken, and it was excellent. Moist and flaky. I loved the Strawberry Shortcake too. The portions are huge! We didnt find the place to be dirty when we came. They have their own free parking lot and have an ATM inside."
"1","This was some of the worst food I've ever had.  If this is someone's idea of nostalgia, nostalgia is a term I'd like to forget, and the reality is more like nausea.  Their greek soup (tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle flavored with lemon) and nasty lamb gyro douched with cucumber dressing will likely haunt me as long as I live.  For anyone looking for a good nostalgic diner experience, i can't make a recommendation because I've yet to experience one, but at least in this case, leave the past where it belongs."
"2","After many years of going past this place, I finally had the chance to go in and check out the food! As soon as you enter Ritter's Diner, right there in front of you is an ATM- credit/debit cards are not accepted. The d\u00e9cor is not modern, but it still adds to the diner's charm. The waitresses, who wear hospital scrubs as their uniforms, were friendly, but they seemed rather tired while I was there. Nonetheless, my waitress was attentive and provided efficient service. Ritter's Diner is open 24/7 and whatever is on the menu can be ordered any time of day. So for brunch, I ordered a steak breakfast that came with eggs, home fries and toast. Everything was delicious! I am so pleased with my first experience at Ritters Dinner that I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!"
"2","So after the encouragement of many of my friends I decided to gave this place another try.  \nWe had the fried zucchini, spanakopita, and their fish sandwich.  I was prepared to be disappointed by the food again but I instead I had to kick myself on that last review. \n\nIt was still diner food, but as far as diner food goes, it was impressive. I didn't even know diners served this vast variety of food.  I am a huge fan of breakfast food, because besides it being the most important meal of the day, I love the doughy goodness and comfort of pancakes and waffles. This time I was dissuaded from ordering my usual and instead opted for some proper dinner food. \n\nThe spanakopita was a bit soggy but otherwise the meal was above satisfactory. I had my first experience of fried zucchini and now I know what the fuss is all about! They're a delicious alternative to the classic potato fries and I delight to try them again.  While many people are unfavorably disposed to fish,  I love it. I think it's an acquired taste, but their fish was perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce wasn't half bad either! I would definitely go to this place again for a late night meal. \n\nAlso their mini jukeboxes are incredibly cute so if you're feeling extremely nostalgic of the '40's then I'd go here."
"1","People call it \""Critters\"" for a reason.\n\nThe two times I've been there I was unhappy.  It's cheap, but the food is also gross and you don't get much of it (thank goodness!).  Very small toast, cold hard pancakes, and adequate dippy eggs was what I received last time I went.  \n\nOh, cash only too."
"1","Joyce was a great server. She took great care of our party of 7 and was very personable. \n\nCheap, average diner food. You can have subpar breakfast, lunch or dinner at any time of the day! Best consumed late night when nothing else is open. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here besides a late-night drunk snack."
"1","Ummm, we're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here. That was the last thing we had eaten for hours, and the next morning he DEFINITELY had eaten something bad after waking up... yikes."
"2","Ummm..... so I will just be upfront and say that the few times I have been here I was at least a few drinks in, but this is an excellent place for cheap diner food and is fortunately open late into the night. I'm from the south, so it is very reminescent of Waffle House- which is awesome. The waitresses are nice and understanding of the state that some people come in at 3 in the morning, and it will always be a place I look to when I need greasy breakfast-type food. The hashbrowns are particularly amazing. From what I remember, it was cash-only, so if you go out make sure to have the moneys on you!"
"2","Pretty standard Greek diner - omelets, gyros, pastas and burgers with a 1970s look. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the lunch/dinner items (maybe I just haven't found the right items yet), but the breakfast fare is great! No exaggeration, we probably come here once every other weekend. The Greek omelets are delicious, don't let the idea of lettuce in an egg dish scare you off. \n\nAlso it should be said - the waitresses here deserve major praise. They work VERY hard and almost always with a smile, no matter how much they're running around. They're fast, pleasant, and they are always busting their tails in this hectic place. The food is really pretty inexpensive, so 10-20% for a table of two would usually only amount to about $2-4, so my advice is tip the waitresses well - they really deserve it! :)"
"1","Don't get me wrong, the foods great, but when there's only a handful of booths full it shouldn't take an hour and a half to get breakfast. If you get to the point that you'd rather leave and go to McDonalds just so you can eat something it's too long of a wait."
"1","How does this place even stay in business. It's disgusting. The food is crap. Everything is filthy. All the waitresses look like crackheads. They screwed up a club sandwich & fries. How is that even possible?  It deserves negative stars for sucking so badly."
"1","We were skeptical to eat here based on the mixed reviews. We can now say we've tried it and we probably won't go back. We were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking. Instead of escorting us to a seat, she told us which tables to pick and to seat ourselves. I ordered the sirloin of beef with mashed potatoes and my fiance got the steak and eggs. The food was just okay. Our server was friendly and attentive. We were thankful we didn't have one of the other servers, who was clearly dying of pneumonia or bronchitis or something. She was coughing up a lung in front of everyone and sniffling every 5 seconds. She washed her hands a lot, but the hostess did not wash her hands upon returning from smoking outside. Kind of gross if you ask me."
"1","What you expect out of a 24 hour diner.  Food can be pretty good, service can be pretty bad."
"1","I remember my first experience at a diner: Art Deco-inspired architecture, narrow and long floorplan, jukeboxes, neon signs, quick service, and extremely tasty pancakes with chocolate syrup! Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.\n\nMy friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.\n\nWe get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.\n\nBased on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.\n\nSo to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes."
"1","It is definitely an experience. Located in not such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok, grease upon grease. Everything came out from the kitchen hot, but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan. Waitresses do not make much of an effort. She was more concerned with eating her meal.  Cashier was a breath of fresh air. She was chatty and nice."
"1","I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr, who I assume is the owner. He finally came to our table and after I explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldn't have any customers then he walked away. He did nothing to compensate us for the long wait. I go here because it is convenient for everyone. The food is just so so. Well this will be my last visit. I understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better. Ritters gets a Failing Grade in this category and an OK for the food."
"2","Best brunch ever!  You will have better luck getting seated quickly if you arrive by 10am.  They have the best potatoes in the burgh and it's good food that will stick to your ribs!  The service is always quick and friendly."
"2","I pulled into this unassuming restaurant for lunch.    The place is old school.   I feel as if I am in a Good Fella's movie.     There aer 2 standup gambling syle video game machines (think space invaders but they are are called \""Magical Odds and the other one is not named but has is a memory game.\n\nThe place is very friendly.    \n\nI ordered the wedding soup and the Spinach Gnocchi with a Crown and Diet Coke- I needed a drink after driving the hot wheels track known as Downtown Pittsburgh - I think my GPS needed a drink too ;-)...\n\nMy wedding soup arrived and I felt it was a littel under seasoned but that is something I can definitely add - no dings here.\n\nThe Gnocchi arrived and it was quite tasty.     The pasta was done right - I had felt like I was eating spinach dumplings.    I orignally was going to request a meat but this meal needed none of that nonsense.\n\nThey have a lunchtime buffet that looked good but I wanted to try something made fresh for my first stop.\n\nOverall - I like this place\n\nService - Great - super friendly\nFood - Very good - The Gnocch and their other homade pastas deserve a try\nPrice - My meal (dinner menu) was $17.\n\nCheck this place out - it will definitely take you back to the 70's :-)"
"2","Once again, the best friend and I were out and about on errands - in this case, her appointment with the dentist - and what better food choice to explore before 'open wide' than good old family Italian? Can we get extra onions with that?\n\nWe decided to give the lunch buffet a try, and arrived around 11:30 am. Sign on the door said hours were 11 am to whatever, but we got there to find the doors still locked.  I walked around the corner to see a studly guy standing outside the back door smoking, and asked if they were open. He looked at me surprised, and said he'd be right there. He came and unlocked the front doors, and in we went, past the muscle man with the cool brown eyes.\n\nWe were the first to arrive, and as I looked around the room(s) and I have to say it was kind of charming in that 1970's Soprano's kind of way. Like a mom and pop Italian place you'd expect to find somewhere in Jersey.  This is kind of living proof that Pittsburgh is indeed stuck in 1979, but in this case, in a GOOD way. There's even a baby grand piano just inside the front doors.\n\nWe did not order from the menu, as I said, we went to try the lunch buffet and I have to say, we were impressed.\n\nIt is not a large buffet, quite small in fact, but ample for only $7.95.  It basically contains a chafing dish of appetizers (this day had Clams Casino, some kind of fried mashed potato balls and fried zucchini), another with a pasta dish (tomato vodka today with fresh basil - VERY delicious), two meats (something like a beef brisket in one and the other a chicken cacciatore - the beef was excellent, as was the chicken), a small selection of salads (pasta, tossed, slaw and a bowl of beets), a tray of bread and rolls, and two different cakes for dessert.\n\nNow, even though we were the first to arrive, meaning early and the food was fresh, the chef and his trainee kept attending to the hot foods, showing sincere concern that it all stay fresh...and it did the entire time we were there. \n\nThe waitress was a very pretty 'woman' as opposed to the usual college student, and was extremely nice and helpful. The muscle man was apparently the bartender - ok - you can stand there and look pretty as long as you like.\n\nThey carried Pepsi products, so we ordered fresh brewed tea instead, and it was fine.\n\nTotal bill for two for a very satisfying lunch buffet was $20 and some change, very pleasant service AND eye candy, and a quaint trip down 'Scenes From An Italian Restaurant' meets 'Soprano's' memory lane.  \n\nI can't speak for dinner (yet) but if the food is as good, skip the pretentious Bistroids, and barking manager of Del's, and the potential gunfire from Pleasure Bar...and give them a shot. And DEFINITELY drop by for a super inexpensive and pleasant lunch if you happen to find yourself in the Bloomfield neighborhood."
"2","Awesome food and service.  Family owned homemade itAlian food. They way it's suppose to be. Will go again when I'm in Pittsburgh"
"1","Well, as stated in the previous review of their lunch buffet, we finally went for dinner, and were horribly disappointed to discover a night-and-day comparison between the lunch and dinner. I had gnocchi, she had Veal Imperial, and we ordered 'traditional style' which meant for an addition $4 it came with marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup and salad. My friend left 1/3 of her veal dish on her plate and didn't want to take it home. I took a bite, and my tongue experienced absolutely no flavor, to the extent that I had to take a sip of my iced tea to see if I was getting a cold and losing my sense of taste. I could taste the tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING from her veal.  With the gnocchi, I ordered the sausage, which was again $3 extra, and when it arrived it was a flat sausage patty cut in half, that tasted like a dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies. The wedding soup had two tiny meatballs and about 1/3 cup of celery. The meal in general was a total disaster, but we ordered dessert anyway, and the tiramisu was still partially frozen. Then the bill came to over $82.  \n\nWe could not believe that we'd enjoyed the lunch buffet so completely, which was only $7.95, and that this dinner, as overpriced as it already was, was so completely void of flavor and character. \n\nIt's baffling to comprehend that an Italian restaurant that's been around as long as they have would still survive with these prices and total lack of quality for dinner. We had gone in with such high hopes.  But honestly, for dinner, it was such a huge let-down, we'll never go back. We'll go to the lunch buffet, but never to dinner. It was truly, truly just plain sad."
"2","Family friendly! While some reviewers may lament the outdated interiors, a feature that was not missed by me, I will merely say that Lombardozzi proved to be the best venue for our toddler that we have come upon in months. Our server did not know the difference between bolognese and meat sauce, but she brought soup and milk for our toddler faster than you can say pronto! She fawned over our daughter and made us feel comfortable. \n\nAdditionally, the owner and chef both came to our table to talk to us. My husband and I felt like we were eating at a friend's house, and that warmth is a hell of a lot sexier than any atmosphere we've gotten in a swanky Shadyside lounge. \n\nWe ordered simple pasta dishes: linguine and meat sauce, and spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was fresh and al dente; the garnishes were tasteful and classic; the sauces were remarkable. \n\nI recommend this place for the food and congenial service. It would easily get 5 stars if we hadn't sat in the outdated bar."
"1","Don't waste your time!\nOh, where should I start..?\nMy family and friends came here for a Sunday lunch. The prices are crazy high (for -cheap- pasta). The menu outside the building and website doesn't match what they show you at the table. One of our guest was the last one to receive his perfectly square cheese ravioli and the filling was still frozen! (You'd think that for a $16 ravioli plate you'd get home made). After they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat. Some had flavorless Chicken Piccata, Fish and Eggplant Parmigiana. The atmosphere didn't help. The only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce. \nI don't understand the big fuzz some make about this restaurant. What a joke!"
"1","There has been a pile of vomit on there sidewalk for 10 days, For the life of me I cannot believe they havent taken care of this, such a turn off.  Today is 10/3"
"2","Best Burger In The Universe.\nI am a burger lover.  People ask me, \""Alli, where can I get the best burger in DC?\"" I tell them that they need to take 270 to Frederick, get on 70 west, get on the PA turnpike, and get off when they're near Pittsburgh.  Ask anyone how to get to Tessaro's - I'm sure they know.\n\nYour burger will be huge, dripping, and will be so juicy that the bottom bun will be a disgusting soggy sponge.  None of that will matter, because you will be in burger heaven, delighting in the freshly ground beef that makes Tessaro's what it is.\n\nThe restaurant itself is barely more than a bar, with mean waitresses and tiny, crammed tables.  No one would probably ever go there (besides the old, crotchety regulars) were it not for the world-famous burgers.  All testament to why you must go. Now."
"2","As good as they say. 5 star burger, and not just by Pittsburgh standards. Dry bleu cheese.\n\nSteak salad, spinach salad with steak are also good.  \n\nI used to say this is the only restaurant in Pittsburgh. Good food, professional service, a nice ambiance (a bar with a tin ceiling) and even a bit of view of the street and hills. And alcohol."
"2","My first Pittsburgh review!  Believe the hype about Tessaro's; I can't recall eating a better burger than the one I had there last night.  A half-pound of quality beef, crisp bacon, bleu cheese, grilled mushrooms and onions, all served on a fresh-baked bun....well worth $9.50 and the month that mother probably took off my life.  I was also impressed that they actually cooked it to my specification; when I order a rare burger at most places, I usually get medium at best.  Good beers on tap, too.  Tessaro's figures to be a regular destination for me while I'm in the 'burgh."
"2","It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about this place.  But, I feel the need to re-iterate just how great these burgers are.  After a very long night I woke up in my hotel room feeling the effects of the previous night.  Had a friend in from Delaware and he actually suggested we go after seeing it featured on the food network.  We were there before they opened and actually waited for them to unlock the doors.  I had a gourmet burger cooked perfectly.  The meat had a ton of flavor and it was grilled perfectly.  The  hash browns were a nice change than fries and the coleslaw actually tasted great and wasn't just a \""throw away\"" side.  My friend chose a burger with no cheese or condiments just to savor the burger in it's pure form.  True to the hype my friend declared what I'm sure has been spoken many times that this is the \""best burger he's ever had\""."
"2","Tessaro's has some of the finest burgers in the US.  A wonderful \""corner bar\"" kind of atmosphere makes it THE place to take people in from out of town.  Grilled meats and daily seafood specials (try the prawns) are available and also an excellent choice, but the burger is easily the main event.  \n\nThere are a few downsides, it's frequently packed on the weekends, seating can be cramped, and taking a party of more than 4 is damn near impossible.  But I'd still highly recommend it to anyone!"
"2","The secret in their having one of the best burgers you will ever eat, is in the meat!  They add ground steak including filet mignon!  Another reason why the burger seals in all of those juices plus adds flavor is they are cooked over a 500 degree hardwood grill.\n\nTessaro's was not hard to find, but in a run down area.  They have a parking lot on the side of the building, connected with a grocery store's lot..  The place is small, with a huge bar in the middle.  It was crowded, but we were lucky enough to get a booth.  \n\nI was a bit disappointed in their not having french fries, but I tend to fill up on them, so in a way it allowed me to finish that delicious huge burger!\n\nI hear they are known for their ribs, as well. The murals are hand painted of the owners and workers and an Irishman and his sister own the restaurant and do the cooking.  The soups are homemade as well.\n\nServers were older and ours was friendly and helpful!  Go and have yourself one of the best burgers you will ever have in your life and add a hot homemade bowl of soup to your check, outstanding!"
"2","I went here after reading all the great reviews here on yelp. I was not disappointed and I don't believe my companion was either. It was a Friday night around 9 and the place was packed. We got right in and was seated in less than a minute.Our server came right to us for our drink order. We both ended up ordering burgers, I had the BBQ and it was bomb, delicious. O, and they came so fast, I mean  I was expecting a long wait considering I ordered mine Medium Well. Very good all around and the bill was round $40 for 2 burgers and 4 drinks."
"2","I have to agree with all the other yelpers, this is a GREAT burger. After reading all the great  yelp reviews,  I took my family, including my out of town mom, for lunch on a Saturday and was not disappointed. I knew from the smell outside of the building that it was gonna be fantastic eats. We were happy with the service also. We had a party of six and did not have to wait. We will go back again and again and again..."
"2","If you're looking for the best hamburger in the city, this place is \""it\"".  Go no further.  You won't be disappointed."
"1","Putting lamb in your burger is not my idea of 'gourmet' burger. Sure it tastes unique, but there are better ways to skin the cat. Good, but after a couple of times I got VERY tired of the 'unique flavor' of their meat."
"1","I was entirely underwhelmed by the supposed \""best burger\"" in Pittsburgh, as it had been recommended to me.  I guess I was expecting more flavor - some kind of house seasoning or something special, but it was very ordinary.  \n\nIt was quite busy and seemed a little cramped inside.  They seated us near the window facing LIberty, which was great - but the way the seating was arranged, my friend had her back to it.  I generally prefer  tables perpendicular to the window which allow everyone to look out occasionally without craning their neck.\n\nI'm hesitant to go back, because the burger was the best-sounding thing on the menu and it wasn't that great."
"1","I also left here scratching my head after all of the lofty reviews of the place.  Yes, maybe it is a local institution, but it is not worthy of one of the highest yelp ratings for a restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe burger was mildly admirable.  I'll trust their word that they use high quality ground beef, but it's still ground \""beef\"", not ground sirloin or anything.  It was also huge, cumbersome, greasy, expensive and flavorless.  The amount of blue cheese they gave me for 50c was almost a joke, as well.  Wish I would have gotten the steamed broccoli, my \""potato salad\"" was a sea of mayonnaise.\n\nEven given my limited experience of the burger options in Pittsburgh, I would put double-wide grill's burger above these.\n\nNot much for atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind dirty, dark and dingy if it has character."
"1","I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing, it's not likely that I will--but the burgers are just OK. The service, in my opinion, is often quite rude. The \""ambiance\"" is loud, dark, dingy and depressing. Sorry, but I just don't get it. For a better hamburger, try the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, Murray Avenue Grill, or even Five Guys Burgers and Fries."
"1","This place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers.  It may or may not be, and some of the food is actually quite decent- I've had burgers and seafood and chicken and salads over the years.\n\nThe reason why I rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal.  I've always felt like an outsider here, even when we were going once or twice a week for months.  (We live right down the street.)  \n\nThe hosts are terrible - it's like they look right past you if you're not one of their Special Friends and they shoehorn you into tiny and uncomfortable booths while putting smaller parties into comfortable and spacious booths.\n\nI'll go down the street to Lot 17, where the food is better and no one makes you show your \""Member's Card\"" to get seated."
"1","OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere."
"2","The tables were very close together...we had to cram ourselves into our table, which is less than favorable (In fact, upon exiting, my husband managed to slide the tablecloth and silverware off the table with his butt).\n\nI ordered a half rack of pork ribs, which  seemed at bit expensive to me at $14 until they arrived at the table. The half rack is HUGE compared to some other places where I've tried ribs. The meat was tender and falling off the bone, and their barbecue sauce (I got the mild) was quite tasty...if they sell bottles I'm going to buy one. For the side dish I got the boiled redskin potatoes, which unfortunately are literally nothing more than boiled redskin potatoes -- no salt, pepper, butter, or seasoning of any sort. I'll remember that next time.\n\nHusband got the black and bleu burger, which he reported was good except the bun was too small. The service was fine, nothing special. The atmosphere was friendly and the place was busy but not crowded, which is a good sign in my book. The closeness of the tables to each other is a bit bothersome to me though. We could hear the conversation of the couple next to us much more than I would have liked...I felt like we were all up in their business.\n\nWe'll definitely be back."
"1","Never been treated so poorly\n\nI went with three friends to eat at Tessaro's on a rainy Saturday evening.  I dropped them off while I parked the car.  The hostess  sat them and when she found out I was parking the car, she told them literally to \""GET UP.\""  She said they wouldn't seat them because I wasn't there.  By that time I had arrived at the table  my friends were still in shock by the utter rudeness.  Tessaro's was a Pittsburgh institution that my family had frequented for years.  Our treatment is a disgrace to its reputation"
"1","The burger was pretty good but, I've had much better. Tables are really close to each other like others have said. What I really didn't like about this place was the service. We had to flag down our waitress just to get refills. We were rushed through our meals like we weren't wanted! I mean they weren't crowded or anything. There was one other table of people besides us on the dining side and maybe 10 people at the bar. \n\nI should have went to Five Guy's! I would have been much happier!"
"2","best burger in pittsburgh**.\n\n\n\n________\n** based on taste, price, service and comfortable atmosphere perfect for a casual lunch, or proper dinner."
"1","Overrated. No seating until all members if party have arrived...so we awkwardly hovered over empty tables.  The second bummer here was the lack of french fries  - which is borderline criminal when you offer a burger.  The bun was dry, the burger was ok, generous portion of meat though.  Nothing special here.  the crowd here is about as un-diverse as you can get. not sure what all the hype is about."
"1","I'm always trying to hit up places that are listed in the fantastic book \""Hamburger America.\"" Tessaro's is one of two places to be listed for Pennsylvania. I visited while in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago with high expectations. I like the joint, it seems like a family run business, and there's a lot of people coming and going. We didn't have to wait long for a table, and the service was fine. I do like the atmosphere, but I just had so many better burgers that I just can't rave about this place.\n\n\nThey don't have a frier, so your burger comes with home fries or potato salad. This wasn't bad, but I really love the classic combination of burgers and fries. Maybe it was an off day. I know they have their own butcher who works in house, and that is exciting. But the burger wasn't memorable at all.\n\n\nBottom Line: I've had better."
"1","I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and  the atmosphere, so I'm sad to have to write a review that speaks poorly about the place.  Having said that, my last experience at Tessaro's was ruined before we were even seated.  While waiting with my girlfriend to be seated for 25 minutes, a party of 3 walks in and is immediately seated.  When I ask why a party of 3 would be seated before the many parties of 2 waiting I was told that the seating was laid out specifically to accommodate a specific number of people: absurd!  We proceed to wait another 15 minutes until a 2 top opened up.  \n\nI would gladly recommend this place on the food, but given how inefficient the seating system is I'd only go when you can be seated right away."
"2","Tessaro's is so old school it hurts. They're known for their burgers and on this occasion the hype suits the reality.\n\nThe inside becomes somewhat cramped during their busy hours but I always seem to get seated quickly. The meny is traditional and I've only had their burger. Yes, their burger is incredible. It's huge, cooked well, and on a good, sturdy bun. Like all good burgers, the meat steals the show but the veggies keep the burger's pace. I hate a burger that's all meat, Tessaro's is very balanced. I wish they had french fries as a side but, like I said, it's an old school joint and they serve old school sides.\n\nEither way, I can't complain, their homefried potatoes are good.\n\nThe service is impeccable and I haven't had anyone who wasn't over 40 and looked like they'ved worked there their whole life. They know what they're doing and they do it quickly. Tessaro's can handle a crowd, they've been doing it for years."
"2","Facts: I am not a big meat eater.  I am not a vegan, vegetarian or any combo.  I like good food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable.  \n\nAll that being said, I have searching a place that serves great burgers.  I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that I order a burger.  So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro's.  I expected a dive with somewhat gruff service.  Uh, no, Tessaro's is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight.  And the service was tremendous.  Yes it was a Thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! That makes sense to me.  No use taking up a table with a partial party who is \""faffing.\"" (Google term if confused)\n  \nI had a medium rare burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  The beef was good!!  This means a lot coming from me a non-meat eater.  The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.  Mr. Handsome devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction.  Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.\n\nWill be recommending Tessaro's to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!\n\nPS there are options for non-meat eaters:)"
"1","my burger was really dry and tasteless, and I ordered it to be cooked medium. I was disappointed in this place because everyone says its the best burger in town...I must be missing something. I thought the atmosphere kinda sucks and the way seating is done leaves much to be desired...overall might go back to see if it was just a fluke, but wont be rushing there."
"2","I've been going to Tessaro's for years. Every trip back to the 'Burgh wouldn't be complete without a lunch or dinner there. It's my go-to place for meeting friends for a meal when we want something tried and true with no froufrou. And I am never disappointed. \n\nI have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro's partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them \""to order\"" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked. She didn't seem bothered by my request. And honestly, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference. That being said, it still was the best tasting perfectly cooked burger I have had in a long, long time. With all the new specialty burger joints popping up across the country, I still dare any one of them to stand off side by side with Tessaro's. Our usual picks are the Deli and the Bacon-Blue Cheeseburger, but you can pick any burger on the menu and be satisfied, and then some. I also love their home fries. Yummy! The marinated gourmet chicken sandwich is also a winner if you aren't into red meat! \n\nOne of my other favorites at Tessaro's which I have to admit I haven't had in eons since we haven't made it there for lunch recently is the tuna melt on rye. It has been on the menu forever. If you want one, you have to go for lunch as even though its on the lunch menu, they refuse to make it at dinner :( \n\nThe atmosphere here is strictly neighborhood bar/restaurant. Nothing fancy. I am sometimes put off by the way they offer seating (first-come, first-serve) and they will try to cram four people at a table that is meant for only three. If they are not scrambling for tables to seat people waiting, I'd ask for another less cramped table and wait; but on a crowded night, take the first thing available or you could be waiting a long, long time."
"1","So everyone always raves about this place infamous burger joint in bloomfield, so I had to try it...and I should just have listened to my capricorn perfectionist gf because she was right when she said it is overrated. We both got burgers...I got the bbq and she got the bleu. The burgers tasted like one part oxygen and 1 part hydrogen. At least the soup was good...and our waitress didnt know how to properly place the salt n pepper shakers....salt on the right(for the blind)....\nAnother negative about this place is that people sit so close to you, just like mad mex. It takes away your privacy, I wanted to talk about baby fetuses but couldnt"
"1","Never understood all the hype about this place. The burgers are rather bland and burnt.  No fries, only their potato things which are NOT as good as any fry I have ever had.  And the wait was always ridiculous to boot.\n\nI admittedly haven't been here in a few years, but it doesn't seem like this is the type of place that would have changed."
"1","Eh,\n\nSo much hype, but the burgers are over ground and too big for the bun.  Maybe it was just over hype, but I want all the wonderful burger things to occur when I'm munching a burger, not just tons o' ground beef in a bun.\n\nTry BRGR just up the road."
"2","\""You're in the hot seat tonight. That's where Christian Bale sat on Thursday!\"" said our sweet waitress to my husband. \""He had the bluest eyes. I was going to ask him if they were contacts, until I realized who it was.\""\n\nPerhaps needless to say, I proceeded to spend most of the rest of dinner imagining what it would be like to have dinner with Christian Bale, but each time I was brought back to reality by a bite of my tasty burger. I went with a traditional American cheeseburger, while Christian, I mean, my husband, got the Gourmet burger. Both were cooked to our specifications (medium and rare, respectively), and were juicy and flavorful. No french fries here as sides, which is an interesting decision, and makes the experience more unique. Though we could have gotten something healthy, like steamed broccoli, we both went with the home fries. They were great: tender on the inside, crispy on the outside & flavorful. Because so many of the review focused on the burgers, we were surprised to see they have lots of other menu items, including fish & ribs. So, I plan to return and give some other menu items a try. Prices are very reasonable, and I'd say easily the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh (though it's no Vortex burger!!). \n\nAnd, by the way, Mr. Bale is an excellent tipper."
"1","I have to preface this review with two factors. One, I moved here from South Florida, where the best burgers in town came from your average diners.  They were the last bastion of American food in South Florida, so they served up REAL American food.  If you wanted a real burger, you went to a diner.  After returning to Pittsburgh, I found that every diner here has turned to serving up those frozen gray hockey puck patties and passing them off as burgers.\n\nSecond, (until the recent explosion of good burger joints in da burgh), I actually HAD been a fan of Tessaro's, until their hostess/manager flat out offended the hell out of me and my party of three.  The result is that I have never, and WILL never return to Tessaro's.\n\nMy best friend is a 62 y/o blind woman that I met doing theater in the 90's in Pittsburgh.  She lives with her 91 year old mother, and her father (the driver) passed away several years ago.  I don't drive, and rely on the bus system that Steve Bland is intentionally systematically destroying, so any outing that we make must be carefully planned.\n\nShe and I had met once at Tessaro's.  It was her first time being there.  She took the Access van for the disabled, and I met her there after work via bus.  I walked in, she was seated, having a drink, waiting for me to join her. No problem.  We had a great meal, with an awesome burger.  I can't say enough...they really do have mouthwatering burgers.\n\nMonths later, we decided to go again, and the plan was pretty much the same.  She took the Access van to the restaurant, and I was going to meet her by bus, and this time a new friend was going to join us, coming by bus from Oakland, and new to Pittsburgh.\n\nMy best friend called me at 4:30 (we were supposed to meet at 5) and said that her van had come early, and that she was already at the restaurant.  I told her I would get there as soon as I could.  I left work a few minutes before 5 pm, and arrived at the restaurant 5:15.  They were busy, but I was surprised to find my friend still standing in the doorway.  The blind woman had been standing there for 45 minutes.  \n\nI made my presence known, and the hostess/manager acknowledged, asked about our other friend. I explained that he was ten minutes away and coming by bus, new to the city, but WAS on his way.  She walked away from us.  We stood in the doorway fro another twenty minutes.\n\nFinally, the manager came back, and I caught her attention, and motioned my head toward my blind friend, and asked if we really had to keep waiting?  She'd been standing there in the doorway for over an hour.\n\nThe next statement sealed the deal on us never returning to Tessaro's.  The manager slapped her hands on her hips, and started barking:\n\n\""LOOK!  We don't have many rules around here!  In fact, we only have ONE, that you don't get seated until your whole party is here!\""\n\nAnd THIS is what really sealed it:\n\nThe woman thrust her thumb in my BLIND friend's direction, who had only been to Tessaro's ONCE before in her life, with me, and said:\n\n\""And SHE oughta KNOW that!\""\n\nShe oughta know that?  Exactly HOW should she 'know that'? The only other time she'd been there, she arrived before me, was seated, waited, and I joined her.\n\nAdditionally, the 'rule' was posted...on a piece of 8 1/2 by 11 copy paper, taped to the wall at the end of the counter, behind several rows of water pitchers.  I couldn't see the 'rule'...a blind woman certainly wasn't going to 'see' it!\n\nFinally, after another ten minutes standing there, the manager 'allowed' us to take a table and wait for our friend, who came five minutes later.  We ate our meal, paid our bill, and we left.\n\nAnd we will NOT return.\n\nYou can treat me badly, and if there's something I really love about your business, I might come back.  But do NOT badmouth a blind woman, or anyone else for that matter, who is disabled, and in need of a slight amount of extra consideration.\n\nTessaro's, you might make good burgers, and you'll continue making a fortune off them.  And I'm sure you really don't give a crap about how your manager treated this lady.  But we will NOT drop one dime more in your restaurant.  We'll take our business to Burgatory."
"2","Give me burgers or give me death!\n\nI think I got that quote right, didn't I?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, they make the best freakin' burgers in the burgh.  I'm sure there are people that would disagree.  Heck, I have friends who would disagree.  But I don't care, I know I'm right.  \n\nWe moved to Pittsburgh from North Carolina and Tessaro's was the first place we encountered that would cook a burger to order at anything other than well done.  And I like my beef pink.\n\nThis place serves up HUGE, tasty burgers with great toppings, and very yummy home fries-style potatoes to go with them.  You could probably substitute the side, but why would you want to?\n\nIf you're hungry when you arrive and can't wait for a burger (or if you are Catholic and grace this place on a Friday during Lent), I enjoy the Seafood Chowder -- rich and creamy with chunks of seafood and just the right combination of seasonings.  \n\nI've never had anything else here, but a friend ordered the steak salad once and I was almost tempted to trade in my burger, it looked so good."
"1","My boyfriend and I went here for burgers because there are so many good reviews and we heard that they're the best in the 'burgh.  I was disappointed.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay.  Maybe my expectations are too high, but I don't want a burger that's purely a slab of ground beef with no seasoning or other flavoring in it.  I've had more flavorful burgers at chain restaurants.\n\nI did like the home fries, very yummy!  And an interesting side dish."
"1","With how Pittsburghers talk about Tessaro's, you'd think it's the epitome of excellent all-American food.  But after having been here four times, all I can really say is that it's very meh and very Pittsburgh.\n\nI apologize for the bland, boring, generic tone of the rest of the review, but I'm not sure how else to describe the food here...\n\nThe portion is 'American' and the burger was really thick and as juicy as I expected done medium.  As with any BIG burgers I like to cut it in half so it's manageable...and so I can still seem somewhat ladylike.  The first half of the burger was OK/good/no complaints.  The second half just seemed to lack flavor...  I guess during the first half I was just hungry, but when you calm down and taste the order, it was so bland.  I mean of course I could taste the mayo/ketchup/mustard, but the actual meat part was just flavorless.  I was really disappointed by that...\n\nI ordered potato salad as my side and it was good/OK too...nothing to call home about.\n\nIn all honesty I would've rather had Five Guys or In-n-Out burgers."
"1","I know, it's a Pittsburgh institution and we're supposed to rave about it and declare it the \""best in the burgh\"". It's not. Not even close. I've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe I missed something. Maybe it was me. Oh but it's not. It's not me. It's just not that good. Over hyped, underperformed. Burgers are adequate - nothing special. Order something other than a burger and you don't get much better. \n\nYears ago it might have been worthy of its reputation since there weren't a lot of competitors. Now, forget it. Burgers are ubiquitous and great ones are everywhere. Best burger in the city is at Kaya - the Kaya burger. Tessaro's - a fading icon of days gone by.  Enjoy the crowds, convince yourself your getting the best, that you're in the know. You're  not."
"2","Very good.  I got the barbecue burger with mild sauce.  Would probably go for hot sauce next time since mild was not spicy at all.  The toppings are nothing special, but the meat itself was cooked well and, for lack of a better term, meaty.  I was hungry and this really hit the spot.  I don't normally go for potato salad, but ordered it based off another review.  It was great!  I even could've eaten a little more than was on the plate.  I also liked the decor/environment -- very homey."
"1","This was my first and last time at this restaurant. I thought Tessaro's was some sort of Pittsburgh landmark and I've heard rave reviews of their burgers. The burger I got was undercooked. I ordered it well done and it was definitely pink in the middle. But I didn't send it back because I never send anything back. I just ate it and it was a sloppy, greasy mess. The bread was cheap and tasteless. The home fries were just diced potatoes. That burger sat clogged in my stomach for 3 or 4 hours. And I had to make a few runs to the bathroom because I thought I was going to make a mess in my pants. Burger king is a lot better than this place and at a fraction of the cost. What else you got Pittsburgh? This better not be the best you got."
"1","I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \""Best Burger in Pittsburgh\"" lists than not, and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.\n\nThe ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \""medium rare\"" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.\n\nThough shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger, try Burgatory.)"
"2","Tessaro's definitely provides a solid burger to their patrons, and their side options are also delicious.  I got the gourmet burger, medium rare, with broccoli and cauliflower.  The veggies were excellent.  The burger was tasty as well, but it was extremely under cooked.  I know I ordered it medium rare, but I doubt it spent more than 30 seconds on the grill.  Next time I will go with Medium."
"2","Tessaro's is one of those Bloomfield institutions that certain generations of Pittsburghers always rave about. It's a place that's (apparently) been around forever and just has a cool, old school vibe to it. The decor is totally out of date, just like the uniforms the servers wear. Who thinks that the white button down shirt with the little black tie works in 2012? The owners of Tessaro's do, which is part of the charm.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty burger when you're in Bloomfield, you can't go wrong with Tessaro's. For my most recent lunch visit, I decided to change it up a bit and went for the cheesesteak with a side of boiled red potatoes.\n\nI chuckled when my food arrived. The cheesesteak was ridiculously large, overflowing with meat. The red potatoes came with a cup of melted butter for dipping. If you don't think potatoes should come with a cup of melted butter, honestly, you should go somewhere else... somewhere else where you can enjoy hating flavor. Personally, I assaulted those potatoes and didn't look back.\n\nThe cheesesteak was average. With some salt added, it was slightly above average. My advice to the kitchen would be to add some more salt and pepper while cooking to make it tastier out of the gate.\n\nTessaro's provides a classic Pittsburgh experience. While the food may only be worth three out of five stars, I'm going to add on another star because I like the fact that the dining room is dark, the menu is filled with meat, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Bottom line,  Tessaro's is a solid choice if you're in the mood for meat and you want to minimize your chance of running into Bloomfield hipsters."
"1","Came here to try their famed burgers.  I ordered the gourmet burger, and not bad.  However, it was absolutely nothing special. I felt like I could easily make it on the grill at home.  Also, the home fries were just mediocre.  \n\nI don't understand all the rave reviews for this place.  As for me, I don't think I'll be back."
"2","First and foremost, I eat beef about once a month if that--so I hope I can critique this place fairly!  \n\nWhen you walk into this place you can smell the smoky, wood-burning smell of the grill, I loved that!  The dining room is dark and definitely original interior, loved that too!  The wait staff was extremely friendly, as well!\n\nNow for the burger:  It was absolutely huge!  When I bit into it I tasted the smokiness of the grill and it was nice and juicy.  The toppings, though, were your standard lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.  I would have loved to have this burger and the Burgatory toppings!  My 16 year old son finished his burger in no time flat, along with his hashbrowns, that he loved.  My father could not finish the burger, nor his coleslaw side.  I got a nice healthy side of steamed cauliflower and broccoli (like it mattered at this point), and was able to eat 3/4 of the burger and all my veggies!!\n\nMy only disappointment regarding the place was that they did not have dessert on the menu!!  My son and I had to walk up to Paddy Cake Bakery so that he could then satisfy his sweet tooth!"
"2","I ate here this past weekend with my husband and a large group of friends. Although they don't take reservations (at least not this weekend, maybe because of the holiday) our party of 11 was sat together rather quickly at 8:30. Most of us got the Gourmet Cheeseburger and it was delicious! The burger was huge! It was juicy and full of flavor. I had mine topped with blue cheese, along with the onions and mushrooms. I chose to get the chips as my side and they were not homemade, something I was hoping for since all the other food was of such high quality. Our waitress was a bit scatterbrained and when she brought our food out, had no idea who got what and kept insisting the plates were right even though we each remembered what we got. Other than that, it was a great experience and I would definitly go back."
"2","Last night I diverged from the \""usual\"" and ordered the chicken kabob instead of the 1/2 pound Goliath of meaty goodness. \n\nMy girlfriend suffered copious \""meal envy\"" when our spiky haired 21-year Tessaro's veteran waitress handed me an overflowing plate of charred (in a good way) chicken & huge chunks of red & yellow pepper, onion, zucchini, yellow squash, & mushroom. The only flavoring was the grill - no sauce or spices - which at first came off as bland but soon became enjoyable as my normally over-salted palate adjusted to the simple delights of unadorned food.\n\nGF had a cheeseburger & boiled potatoes and she enjoyed it a lot. Their boiled red skin potatoes are another simple treat reminiscent of my Mom's Sunday dinners culled from her Germanic roots that often included new potatoes with vinegar, onions, and butter. Truly delightful! \n\nOur waitress was really a gem - old school dame with some sass and a family tale of a sister-in-law with black & silver locks that turned heads. She made no fuss and profusely mea culped when we pointed out an extra drink on our receipt.\n\nWe ventured into the Ladies Room before leaving and found it to be clean and well maintained; adorned with antique mirrors.\n\nTessaro's is a longtime neighborhood meeting place that has survived on good service and two-fisted burgers."
"2","This is going to be short and sweet. It's the best burger in the 'Burgh, hands down! The in-house ground beef is so much better than what those trendy burger bars are offering right now. Tessaro's doesn't need to top their burgers with a bunch of ridiculous toppings as their beef is just that damn good. I don't even want to try anything else there as the burger was the first thing I ever had and I keep getting it every time I go there. The BBQ burger cooked medium is perfection!"
"1","This review only encompasses my 2-3 experiences with burgers - THE thing Tessaro's is known for. All I can say is - I don't get the hype. If it weren't for the blue cheese and bacon it would have been borderline inedible. There didn't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever. Bland would be an understatement. \n\nPoints for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness, but I don't know how the burger here even enter any debate regarding the best burger in the 'Burgh. I'd even say Lot 17 a few doors up has more flavorful burgers - saying nothing of places like Wingharts and Burgatory.\n\nService is always friendly and prompt - but the food is just...OK. I think this place is just more of a Pittsburgh tradition like the similarly overrated Primanti's."
"1","I should preface this by saying this wasn't my pick, and not really my kind of place.  That being said, it's a decent conventional style restaurant and not bad for what it is. \n\nI had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy.  The boiled red skinned potatoes were pretty much what you'd expect boiled red skinned potatoes to be, and they come with melted butter on the side in case you'd really like to pack an artery.  This is definitely not a meal for anyone worried about TMAO.\n\nI don't want to be too hard on the place because, you know, it is what it is, and for what it is, it's not that bad, not that good, just ok; something like that.  \n\nNow, I just wonder how long that burger is going to remain in my gut.  I think I can feel the bacteria burping away in there right about now... Ugh."
"1","I have heard a good amount of positive reviews of this place from lots of different people. That being said, I was expecting to be wowed by their burgers, which is the reason people told me to go. \n\nHowever, when I arrived with my guest, 8:00 PM on Thursday night, I was kind of disappointed. Not only did the waitress take a good 10 minutes before she brought us water, but she was not very attentive and never checked back with us until she brought the bill. The burger was so-so with little flavor, which was very disappointing. I could also tell that a few other tables in my section were looking around waiting for their server.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed by the quality of food as well as the service."
"1","I want to go back to give it a better review, but here is my experience. I called ahead and asked if they had highchairs. When we showed up they only had booster seats. 3 years ago I wouldn't have known the difference, but after spending 2 minutes watching my 1.5 year old thrash around I can tell you their is a big difference. The waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him. Yelp says good for kids they said we have a high chair. The waitress was about as warm and friendly as a night in spent sleeping in the snow naked. The potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par. The burgers are big and if you looking for a giant patty of cheap meat then this is your place. I feel bad because unlike most places I give two stars I really want to like this place."
"1","You when you hear about a place for years and you finally get the chance to try it out but it's bound to not live up to your expectations? That was my experience of Tessaro's. Had I never heard of it before, it may have gotten an extra star. But, this restaurant was on the Pittsburgh's top 25 a few years back. This is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh. If that were the case, I'd stick to making my own. \nHubs and I stopped at T's on a recent Friday night after conducting some business in the area. Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry. Overall, Tessaro's fell flat and left me hung out to dry."
"1","This is the only burger place I have ever been to that doesn't serve french fries. WTF? Went once, only due to bad weather, and would never go again."
"2","A classic old-school joint. The bar dates back I don't know how long. And the service has that old-school quality. I wanted for nothing. I was stuffed by the burger they served me. It was tasty and delicious. I can't wait to go back and enjoy another."
"2","Out of 5:\n3.5 - Burger: The first several times I came here, it was terribly overcooked and dry.  Then, all of a sudden, their quality and consistency of cooking went up significantly.  While it lacks in seasoning, getting them to sprinkle on some salt and pepper while they cook it works wonders.  \n3.0 - Cajun Burger: Now that's some seasoning.  A bit strong and salty but good every once in a while.\n1.5 - Home Fries\n2.5 - Red Skin Potatoes: glad to see some slightly healthier yet not too healthy side dishes here.  Though with the melted butter...\n3.0 - Beef Ribs\n0.5 - swordfish: dry and tough\n2.5 - tuna\n\n1.5 - Service: Can be quite bad a lot of the times, probably because of how busy they are.\n2.0 - Value"
"1","I am only giving this two stars because I believed the hype. The burger I had was good, but it wasn't the best I've ever had, and the menu--even for a carnivore like me---was too meat heavy. And we had to wait to be seated and it was not super cheap, so all these things combined make me less than thrilled with the experience. Perhaps if I had the burger cooked medium rare, things would be different, but I still crown Industry reigning king of all (Pitts) burgers. However, things are not bad by any means, they just aren't the absolute best, as I was hoping for. And there wasn't enough bread to hold the burger, causing me to do the unthinkable and use a knife! The highlight of the night though, was hearing a man refer to his wife as \""my darling\"" when she wasn't even within earshot."
"2","We dined here in January with friends and had a really good time. The burgers are huge and flavorful. I had the barbecue bacon burger which was fantastic. My wife had the reuben burger and was disappointed with the quality and flavor. Drinks are pricey here, beware. Also, it gets crowded here quick! Get there before 6 for sure if you want to avoid waiting."
"2","This is my all time favorite restaurant in Bloomfield. I have never had a bad meal here and have been going here since I was a kid. My favorites are the steak salad with their awesome homemade ranch dressing, chili, gourmet chicken sandwich, and tier homefries and potato salad are the best sides they offer! Sometimes depending on the wait staff they will give you half homefries and half potato salad to enjoy both! You can never go wrong with the bbq burger - I get it with mild BBQ sauce and add cheddar cheese and bacon. I am dying to try the deli burger but have yet to do so."
"1","After getting one of their \""famous\"" burgers, I really don't understand the hype. Mediocre food and mediocre service."
"2","We ate here last weekend on the recommendation of my son's professors.  They told him to 'look for the smoke\"" and we would be there.  We did follow the smoke and it smelled wonderful.  We were able to find a parking lot about two blocks away but the walk was nice.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes which is good considering the size of the place and all the people waiting.  The place is small with a large bar, dimly lit, you can watch the cooks make your food through a large window at the back of the dining room.  We couldn't get past the burger menu. There are other things on the menu but we came for burgers.  I has the blue cheese/bacon burger and it was fantastic.  The home fries were so good but they contain bacon in case your a vegetarian and don't expect it.  They are great.  My husband had a cheddar burger and it too was great.  Full bar service.  Can't wait to go back!"
"2","Sure, the burgers are supposed to be out of this world. I find them kinda meh. But that's because I'm not a fan of burgers. The smell of the grill draws you in from blocks away. \n\nWhat I am a fan of is a place that can actually cook your meat to the requested temperature. By golly, Tessaro's never fails. I ask for a rare steak on the spinach salad, rare it is. Ask for a medium rare burger, done! I overheard a lady praising the kitchen on her well done steak, is that even possible?\n\nI've eaten here MANY times, not that difficult since I've lived in the neighborhood over a decade, and I've heard just about every conversation you could expect. What I've never heard is anyone complaining about the meat temp. \n\nThat is amazing. \n\nSo is the potato salad, though I wish it had egg chunks in it."
"2","This is not only the best burger in Pittsburgh. It's also the best burger in the USA. Cooked to perfection. \n\nThe home fires are off the hook too. \n\nThere is other stuff on the menu but stick with the burgers. \n\nGreat eats. When in Pittsburgh I will make time for a stop at Tessaro's."
"1","4 of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks. The pino Grigio tasted bitter and when we complained the waitress acted like we were bothering her by saying anything and kept trying to walk away. She only came to our table 2 times when we were there over two hours. \n\nBad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around."
"2","As an update, if you get the veggies as your side don't get them cooked on the grill. Sometimes they will do this and char them a bit which is delicious but if your burger is cooked in the same spot the residual plant matter sullies the flavor of the meat."
"1","We came for steaks. Mistake. Probably great burgers (if you read the reviews), but that's it. They don't know how to cook steaks unless you like hockey pucks. They also have a wind problem every time the front door is open. Finally, a supposed owner that works as hostess needs to concentrate on her job and learn how a restaurant is run. We won't go back."
"2","I went at lunch, so it was a little crowded for my liking, but that's to be expected. Despite how crowded it was the service was excellent and I very much enjoyed my HUGE breakfast burger. Reasonable prices, cute, local place. Would definitely go again."
"1","Horrible Food, Horrendous Customer Service, #overrated\n\nSo I already wasted 2 hours of my life eating at this place, so I am not going to write a thesis as to why someone should not be a patron of this restaurant.  In summation, when we arrived we were harassed by the owner (acting as the hostess) for wanting to sit in the corner, served flat beer, and then interrogated by her after sending an order back for not meeting the clear specifications given to the waitress.  Living in Latin America and traveling in Asia for some time, I have been to a lot of hellholes, but this is hands down the worst place I have ever been.  Not only was the food lousy and way overpriced, but we were hassled by the belligerent, sarcastic, and condescending owner almost the entire time. Clearly, customer service nor quality of food are valued.  Honestly, I would rather starve than eat here again."
"2","One of the most delicious burger in Pittsburgh !"
"1","Went for a second time on a busy Friday night and had a 45 minute wait for a table.  \n\nThe wait was not unexpected, so we expected to order drinks and pass the time.  However, the bar tenders were very unenthusiastic about serving drinks to us.  The two bar tenders made us feel like we were putting them out.  While waiting, we were told to stand in the rear coat rack area.  There are about ten wooden posts for coats and above those posts is a rail with an inch thick line of dust.\n\nThe dust doesn't end there.\n\nWe were sat at a booth at the front of the place under a ceiling fan and under an old phone.  The phone above us on the wall is covered in cobwebs and dust.  Each of the ceiling fan blades is covered in dust and that dust and dirt is so thick it is dripping off the sides just waiting to fall in our plates.  \n\nThe food:  average.   Most of us had burgers.  One of us had the open face steak sandwich.  The steak was over charred and under seasoned.  One of us felt the same about one of the burgers.\n\n6 of us plus drinks was $160.00. \n\nThis place needs to be closed for a few days of deep cleaning.  If they don't care about the cleanliness of the dining room, they surely don't care about safe food prep."
"2","If you like cheap, divey bars you need to get yourself to Teabags.  One of the very few bars that I've been to in Pittsburgh with a legitimate mix of people from all walks of life.  The bartenders are almost always lovely (only had one wacky one so far) and the patrons are delightful.  There's a pool table that is usually open, though it's not the finest table in town it fits the vibe of the place.  The drinks are dirt cheap.  The beer is always cold and the mix drinks are strong.  This place is just really perfect in my opinion and I'm just sad I didn't discover it sooner."
"2","We just got back from our dinner at the Pleasure Bar. I ordered eggplant parmesan, starting with wedding soup. The soup was pretty good, although a tiny bit oily and a tiny bit salty. The eggplant parmesan came in a hearty portion with penne and pomodoro sauce. Their sauce is just the right amount of sweet and I enjoyed it. The eggplant was tasty and well seasoned, but a bit chewy around the edges. The prices are very reasonable, and the wait staff was friendly and approachable. The decor is a little PIer One but that's forgivable. \n\nI didn't deduct any stars for this since it's *technically* a special circumstance, but the only downside of the night was that the servers sat down to wrap silverware by turning the TV on really loud right behind us to the series finale of Lost, which I had planned on watching at a later date. Talk about a spoiler alert! \n\nIs this the BEST Italian food in the area? Probably not. But I'm also no expert on Italian food. In all, I found it tasty and a definitely a good value for the price."
"2","When I first moved to the city I drove by the Pleasure Bar all the time thinking it was a strip club. Imagine my surprise when JB suggested we go there for dinner one night!\n\nEverything was tasty - we ordered the assorted fried platter that came with mozz sticks (pretty basic but hey! The cheese was still inside all of them!!!), fried zucchini and potato balls (plump little balls fried crispy on the outside and bursting with creamy whipped potato goodness on the inside). Bruschetta was full of flavor as was the rolled eggplant.\n\nPlenty of parking (paid) in the back of the restaurant.\n\nEvery time we are there we have the same server, Jim, which is cool by us because he's pretty top notch ."
"1","i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time. my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so. We walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table. We stood near the host area for 10 minutes. Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said \""I don't know, 20 to 30 minutes.\"" He was so rude and huffy. We left because of how unhelpful the staff was. I was excited about dining at this place before 10 minutes of frustration. We left immediately and went to the Thia restaurant down the street. It was excellent and they actually valued us as customers."
"1","The appetizers were great. Stuffed mushrooms, but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily. The broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked. Italian wedding soup was okay--tasted like it came from a can. For the price though, it was pretty worth it. \n\nWould only go back for the stuffed muchrooms"
"1","Wow! If I could give negative stars I certainly would for this place. I wanted it to be decent because they have an ok draught selection and seating outside in the summer. That is where the positive qualities end. Food tasted like it came from a microwave - but that is actually generous, probably actually came from Fido's dog bowl. This is an excellent candidate for kitchen nightmares, the place looks straight out of the 80's and not in a cool hipster way either."
"1","Growing up in pittsburgh I heard a lot of good things about this place but it must have gone down hill over the years. \n\nFirst off the area we were sat in was anything but a place you would go for a nice dinner, with a giant TV and no table clothes it basically felt like your typical bar restaurant. Including a few flys to annoy you.\n\nWe were served by a waitress who was generally not interested in waiting on us, sitting us down handing us a paper and said here is our specials, and walked away. She also was singing have the time walking around and mumbling to herself.\n\nI could deal with that if the food was good but it was far from it, I ordered and itialian platter that had a piece of lasagna that had parts that were hard as a brick and clearly seemed microwaved. Then it had a portion of chicken parm and the chicken was paper thin and again hard and dried out.\n\nMy gf ordered the Chicken Romano and it eh alright, it was kinda soggy, not the best but not the worst for her order.\n\nfor what you pay and what you get, just avoid it, not worth trying, over priced and just bad food."
"2","The Pleasure Bar is absolutely not a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars from me bc every time I've dined there I've left happy, full of delicious food, and not broke.\n\nEveryone in Bloomfield knows about the Pleasure Bar, but I'm not sure anyone outside of Bloomfield knows about it.  It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.\n\nI have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!\n\nIs this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.\n\nHeres what we had to eat last night:\n\nthe tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.\n\nMy friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)\n\nI ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.\n\nthe salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.\n\nMy friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.\n\nMy friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. \n\nWe were too full to have dessert.\n\nOur check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.\n\nthis restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.\n\nI highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.\n\n\nGlossary:\n\nOma:  German for grandmother\nNain:  Welsh for grandmother\nStimmt:  True.  Correct\nSenf:  German word for Mustard"
"2","The food here is very good.  I did find the service a tad slow but of all the italian places in this area I would go here first.\n\nI had an italian hoggie that was very good and yes they do have excellent meatballs."
"2","My parents have always talked about the Pleasure Bar and how they used to go here when they were younger, but I have never been.  I have got to say that after going, I am defitiley a fan.  Nice portions, good food, and classic Italian enviornment.\n\nWhen we got here, it was a pretty long wait, but luckily they have a pretty rocking bar here equipped with many TVs and plenty of booze.  Once we sat in the classic Itlaian looking dining area, our waitress came over, and we were starving.\n\nThe greens and beans were delicious.  I was suprised to find out it was only made with lettuces rather than traditional escarole, but it was delicious.\n\nEntrees were also great.  I ordered the half portion of salmon, so I can account for portion size there, but it was great!  Asparagus was delightful.  My parents both got a pasta dish, and there was plenty to share because these plates were packed.  \n\nI would definitley suggest this place.  You know it is a good deal when my dad gets the check and his first words are, \""That's all?!\""  So with that being said, it is pretty affordable too."
"1","Well to be honest this was one of the worst dinning experiences of my eating career. We sat outside and the service was VERY SLOW. Then my purse gets stolen right from my hand by what I can only describe as a gang of thugs. As if that wasn't bad enough the slow wait staff took about ten minutes to call the police and then proceeded to charge us for our mediocre meals even as they saw me telling the police how my wallet had been stolen under the waitstaffs not so watchful eye. Save your money and your wallet and go to wendy's the quality is far superior to this place."
"1","Started out with wedding soup that was so salty it was almost inedible. Asked for the house wine and was given a glass of wine that cost $9.00. (My fault, I should have asked, I guess.) Meals were OK, but nothing special. Even the bread was just so-so. My dinner partner and I both got entirely different meals, and we both experienced serious gastro-intestinal problems after our dinners."
"1","not my fav! weird mixture of sit-downy restaurant and bar, with neither being really good."
"1","Despicable service at the bar, very selective about who they serve, and incredibly rude when you request service after they ignore you for 20 minutes."
"1","Some friends and I were here Friday, August 22nd. It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed understaffed which is unacceptable. \n\nOnce we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.\n\nTwo other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was about 2 hours. Would never consider going back.\n\nThe food was good."
"1","This place does not have good italian sauce it tasted like chef boyardee and my crab cakes were not cooked in the middle it was cold. I wont be back."
"1","Food is great but the service at the bar is horrendous. \n\nLast few times we have went the bartender was unable to cope with even a half full bar. Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. \n\nSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \""give me a second I have to get this for these people first\""  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. \n\nOn the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it."
"1","I have been coming here for years. The doctor was always great and the receptionist was super helpful and sweet. They recently got a new receptionist, I had called about ordering some contacts. She tells me my prescription was not good as i hadn't had an exam in over two years. I had been in earlier that year for an exam and also some contacts so i was confused. \n\nShe tells me that it was just for contacts and that I wasn't charged for an actual exam so no biggie, but the big deal is that days earlier i had ordered 4 new pairs of glasses with the wrong prescription and also i had gone over a year with a bad prescription. It's unfortunate because i had gone in for an eye exam, been told i was getting one, was written a prescription i used to purchase glasses the last year or so. \n\nI guess that may explain my recent headaches. \n\nThen when I tried to talk to her about it, i was given nothing but yelling and rude comments. I had a repor with the other receptionist and didn't know she had left. So when i asked where she went, as she had been there for many years. She said \""she probably left having to deal with rude people like me\"". I was just shocked at the way i was treated, she was talking over me, telling me that I was done talking, and it was late and i had said enough and she didn't care. it went on and on, she was actually yelling at me! And i hadn't even been upset, just trying to say... hey man this sucks what happened, are you guys gonna reimburse me for all the wrong glasses i just ordered? actually check my vision, I was hung up on before i could come up with any resolve.\n\nsad, but never again"
"2","Clean and professional.  Not so cozy beds during the winter.  I was able to get extra towels when we asked for them  Parking does suck as the other review stated.  But we are in Pittsburgh!  It was what i expected!"
"2","We checked in very late but the concierge was very helpful.  The lobby is big and inviting and there's free coffee and wi-fi.  The rooms were clean and big, but what really sold me was the customer service.  The staff was super kind especially when I realized I had forgotten my family heirloom jewelry.  They were quick to assist me during my panic state and were able to locate my belongings and made sure they were safe within 5 minutes. Would definitely stay here again."
"2","Walking into your hotel room can either be one of the simpler joys in life, or a straight-up horror show. Thankfully, my experience with Courtyard Pittsburgh Shadyside was the former.\n\nMy first reaction was, \""Wow, this room is huge.\"" For $179 a night (part of a wedding room block, so unsure if this is discounted or not), we got a queen bed with a nice sized living area (couch, chair, coffee table, desk, etc.), and a balcony overlooking the city. The bed was situated in such a way that it has you looking straight out those sliding glass doors once you're all tucked in - a really nice setup for a Courtyard. And above all, super clean. Even the wi-fi was fast and free, and therefore, fantastic. I was impressed.\n\nSo much so that I can more or less forgive the slew of minor annoyances/inconveniences/nitpicks/whathaveyou. They are, in no particular order:\n\n- No room service and the food court-type restaurant in the lobby holds limited operating hours.\n- Despite the size of the rest of the room, you've got tight quarters in the sink area outside the bathroom. Ladies, before you get all dolled up, you've been forewarned.\n- Slow. Ass. Elevator. My. God.\n- Busy, construction-plagued intersection surrounding the hotel.\n- Mandatory valet. This place is nice, but not nice enough for mandatory valet. Just sayin'.\n\nAgain, these bullets should be taken with a grain of salt as the alternatives are more \""nice to haves\"" rather than \""musts\"" when checking off boxes for prospective hotels. At least, for me. As you can see from the rating, the good here more than outweighed the, well, not bad - let's just say, slightly annoying.\n\nIf you have reason to stay near Shadyside versus downtown, this is your hotel. But hey, if you have business downtown and just wanna stay here anyway, have at it - the hotel has a free shuttle to bring you there, if you're so inclined. For a short stint in Steel City, CPS is a solid spot."
"2","I think it may be a crime to give fewer than five stars to Twisters.  Seriously, they're awesome.  Their soft-serve (try half chocolate, half vanilla!) is probably the best on the planet and they offer homemade ice cream sandwiches.  Everything is affordable, so you can easily feed your frozen dessert addiction.  On hot days, or heck, even on lukewarm days, this is the place to be."
"2","Oh Twisters is fun. We had ice cream here not long ago. I had some Blizzard-type thing, and it was delicious. The girl behind the window was a sweetheart too. I loved her hair and piercings."
"2","The beauty of living directly next to Twisters is that well I have an unlimited supply of frozen goodies right in my backyard literally.\n\nI only get the chocolate vanilla swirl for myself and a small scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream for the puppy.\n\nThe ladies that work there during the summer are always super nice.\n\nNothing to ever complain about here."
"2","They have so many oldies but goodies! However, they stopped making the homemade ice cream sandwiches because they don't have the wafers :( Still a nice treat.  FYI, they only take cash"
"2","Living in South Side almost ruined my love of sports bars -- all I want is a place to watch a game and enjoy some fried food and drinks, without sloppy drunk girls spilling beers on me. Thankfully, my friends took me to Silky's and reminded me that it's worth it to cross the river now and then for a drink. \n\nThe bar food is quality -- I highly recommend the fried zucchini. There's also the Munchies Platter, with provolone sticks, onion rings, chicken wings. It is so massive, my arteries almost went on strike. Crowd is good company, bathrooms are surprisingly clean, and there's about five TVs for your viewing pleasure. If I lived in Bloomfield, I'd definitely be more of a regular."
"2","Pretty good sports bar.  I didn't have any food, but they've got a decent beer selection, and prices and specials are pretty good.  They've got plenty of screens to watch your favorite event(s), and the outdoor seating on the sidewalk is good, too, if you want to escape the sports crowd but still enjoy some of the atmosphere."
"1","We had heard good things about this little neighborhood bar, good beer selection (check), cheerful service (check), good prices on drinks (check), and food (check), and supposedly good food.\n\nThe only problem that our party of 6 had was the way the place was set up, they don't allow smoking inside but they should of. All of the smokers were standing outside in front of a giant sliding, garage style door and all of the smoke was sucked back into the bar. \n\nAll of us agreed this is the worst place we have been in for smoke and some of our group were smokers, they didn't even like it. So if your idea is to sit inside a smokey hazy bar you will love it, but to sit in that atmosphere and dine was impossible. We left for cleaner air."
"2","Incredible drink specials, great atmosphere, and delicious food.  You can't really go wrong there.  They have daily specials and awesome beers on tap.  The pricing is reasonable, for both food and drink.  Non smoking inside, but easy access to smoking outside.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The jukebox isn't bad.  All in all I was pleasantly suprised with how much I actually enjoyed this place.  I was a little leary at first, as I kept associating it with Silky's the strup bar in McKees Rocks."
"1","Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. \n\nSeveral times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.\n\nI'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.\n\nThursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.\n\nI hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. \n\nBy \""multiple times\"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.\n\nThe bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \""Oh, you wanted another?\"" \n\nReally? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.\n\nThe food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated."
"2","Out of my three day, 3 state bar crawl this was my favorite bar. Service was good, the beer selection wasnt amazing but okay, and they had shuffle board. But what sold me was the Silky's had that homey feel to it."
"2","Over the years Silky's or The 'Chester as my friends and I call it (from Shaun of the Dead) has become our go to bar.  This is for few reasons.\n1.  The atmosphere and staff are exactly what we look for in a place.  Silky's balances the line between trendy, divy, and sporty all at once and actually pulls it off.  They have a few TVs which always is showing the big game and usually has good specials during Penguin and Steeler games. Silky's also boasts a shuffleboard table and darts to keep people busy and having fun.  The shuffleboard is a must to try.\n2.  The beer and food are grade A bar quality.  Nothing pretentious here, just good wings, a huge burger, and unique selections.  The beer list isn't huge, but they do carry a few microbrews and some of the local swill.  \n3.  No smoking.  \nSilky's in Bloomfield also has plenty of tables and bar stools and isn't over run with drunk yinzers it attracts a mix of college students, young professionals, and old dudes from the Bloomfield area.  \n\nIf you're searching for a new bar to have some food, play some games, and drink a beer look no further than The 'Chester."
"1","I've been here many times and I'll continue to come back.\n\nThe good:  the drink specials are good.  the food is good.  the location is good.  the crowd it draws is good.\n\nThe bad:  Dont come here if you are really hungry or in dire need of a drink bc the service has been CONSISTENTLY AWFUL.  Tonight, we sat outside and our waitress (Nikki) walked past us four times without making eye contact.  In fairness, I dont think it's an issue with the waitress being bad as much as they really need to hire more waitresses, bc it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant.\n\nOur tabletop was sticky and so after waiting for 20 min for service I decided I really needed a drink and went inside.  The bartender (Olivia) did not want to serve me bc we were sitting outside.  \""Your waitress will be right with you.\""  me:  \""But you are here now, can I please have a Shocktop Wheat?\""  \""Ill tell the waitress.\""  me:  \""Please may i just have my beer?\""  She served me, but then the waitress walked up to me and was like, \""Oh, I didn't see you, weren't you outside?\""  If you didn't see me how would you notice I was outside?\n\nIts ok, I felt bad for her bc she was so busy but like--I'm easy to please.  All I needed was a beer.  I got one, so the waitress and I were then \""cool.\""  She then proceeded to never come back to our table, but that's ok i think we pissed her off.\n\nThis has been a common thread:  not enough waitstaff so you have to beg for your food or drinks when the wait staff does come by.  It's extremely frustrating.\n\nThe time before last we were there we ordered food and the waitress told us that we could expect to wait over an hour bc they had a group of 15 come in.  We thought she was kidding, and had our beers, so we rolled with it but she was not kidding.  We waitied over an hour for our food and the waitress made no apologies.  Also, our friend came and ordered food before ours came out, and this was around 10:30.  after waiting and waiting and waiting we asked the waitress for an ETA on his burger, but it turned out she forgot to put it in, and hte kitchen had closed.\n\nThe service sucks but what really sucks is the staff is never apologetic about it bc this place is a neighborhood bar w locals so they kind of dont care about apologizing bc they know you'll be back.\n\nBut I come here bc like I said the food is ok, but you've got to come here and be very very patient."
"2","I came here for dinner with some friends the other night and it was pretty fun. It was really quiet when we got there and there weren't too many people. It wasn't crowded at all... surprisingly. \n\nWe all tried their pumpkin spice martini which is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I highly recommend it to everyone. It is so good! \n\nThe food on the other hand is just your standard pub fare. It doesn't taste particularly better than any food you'd get at any other pub. It was just okay. I had a buffalo chicken wrap which was good. \n\nOur waitress was on top of things which was nice, but then again, how could you not be on a slow night without many tables right? \n\nAnyway, we had a fun time here. As for the food, I probably wouldn't go back JUST for the food. If I were meeting  a group of people here, I'd definitely come back, but on my own, maybe not."
"2","The only bad thing I can say is that the calamari rings need more sauce and more spice.\n\nThe greens and feta on flat bread was delicious but the flat bread is plain, limp and superfluous.\n\nThe burgers are large and covered in goodness.\nI asked for bacon instead of ham and I was rewarded with a fistful of mana atop my hand formed patty. The egg was a little over cooked and did not drip as I'd hoped.\n\nThe beer selection is good.\n\nThe TV's are a plenty."
"2","I really like Silky's- it's a great little bar with a good two list. Last time I was there the southern tier 2xipa was on. So. Good. I had the Reuben and was so happy with it. \nCrispy buttery bread with corned beef and sauerkraut. The fries on the side were crispy and soft in the middle.\nI'll be back!"
"2","Excellent food! Excellent service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with great service."
"1","Flies in this place."
"1","I'm not one for ordering out at work with coworkers very often and this experience can probably tell you why.\n\nBoston Market has this nifty gadget on their website that allows you to order via the Internet, the order is sent to the store that you select and you just go and pick it up.  Humph, that's where the happiness stops.  Just because you send your order in and are given a time for pick up does not mean that your order will be ready.  Also be sure to print out your \""invoice\"" prior to going or they will literally argue with you that you order is complete.  Out of five orders, only two were done correctly.  So that meant the estimated twenty minutes on the \""invoice\"" actually turned into about 45 minutes.  Would have been easier to drive here, walk into the store and wait for the order to be done.\n\nAnd prices weren't really that great.  Food not as good either, the meatloaf I ordered has several pieces of gristle in it.  And if I hadn't asked for gravy to put on it, it would have been dry beyond believe.\n\nAs the stars say, \""Meh.  I've experienced better.\"""
"2","I love this place for a quick bit!! If ur on a diet this is a great to stop for fast food ..yummmyyy lunch stop"
"1","I came here for a filling after not having time to get it completed by my hometown dentist over Christmas break in early 2011. Not only was the filling $120 (no insurance), payment was demanded immediately upon exit, I also felt very disrespected by the office as a whole. The front staff is very curt and short. The gentleman who did my drilling had a patronizing and smart alleck attitude. When asking questions about the procedure he was doing, he mockingly imitated my voice (I am sorry I am not the most clear and articulate when I have a rod down my mouth getting a filling) to ask me what I said. He was very patronizing the whole time and unsympathetic to my legitimate worries I had seeing as this was the first time I went to a dentist other than the one I went to my entire life since childhood. I would never go back under any circumstance.\n\nEDIT: In my original review I stated this procedure was $250. The correct amount was actually $120. My apologies."
"2","I haven't had a positive dental experience since I left Erie and moved to Pittsburgh. I have to say thank you Cynthia Labriola for making me excited to go to the dentist again! I was referred to this dentist by a friend that swore that she was the best. I had my doubts since I loved my dentist back home. \n\nI was mistaken for sure. The front desk people are incredibly friendly and personable. They asked me a few times how to say my name correctly because they wanted to make sure they pronounced it right, that meant a lot to me. They laughed with me when I told them I wanted to make my next appointment later than 8 am, and told me about them trying to drag themselves into work. It was just so friendly that I enjoyed my checking in and checking out experience\n\nMy hygienist Theresa is amazing. Boy, when she told me she was going to really scrap my teeth, she really did scrap, and my teeth looked amazing. She was friendly, talkative, and informative about the new x-rays machine that they were using. I wouldn't change her for the world!\n\nA great office, a great location (to me), I would recommend this dentist to everyone!\n\nLooking forward to going back there in October!"
"2","I stopped by the Pittsburgh Jiffy Lube on Baum today to get an oil change and tire rotation.  There really aren't a lot of choices to get an oil change on the weekend.  Overall, I had a good experience.  The service was quick, the staff was friendly and everything seems in order. They give out these massive coupon books with oil change/service discounts to get people to come back which I will likely get me to go back.\n\nLike most places like this, they offer to do extra services (air filter change for example) which you could probably do on your own without much hassle."
"2","It took more time to write this review than it did to get my oil change. Nice location."
"1","Located on Baum blvd;  Coming from\nNegley or Liberty ave it will be on your right hand side \nAcross from UPMC cancer center and before Get Go.\n\nIf comming from the opposite direction; be aware there's no stop light. \nDepending on the time of day making a left hand turn can be a challenging.\n\nFor my car the average oil change runs about $40.\n\nOn most visits it takes em about 20 minutes.  It took a little longer because something with my oil pan plug thingy. Whatever the issue \nThey came up to me , explained the issue and apologized for the inconvienance.  \n\nYou'll want be mindful of attempts at upselling though. I was satisfied with their service and would consider returning.\nUpdate.......\nIve been reviewing on yelp for several years now. Its uncharastic of me to give a negative review. Unlike fox news I try to give a fair and balanced review based on my personal experience with a business.\n\nI returned to jiffylube on 12/23/11 to get an oil change. No problems with my oil change. They managed to have the oil changed in under 10 minutes.\n\nHowever the guys were fumbling around with the latch on my hood for several minutes. I stuck head out the door to tell the guys to push the hood button back in then close the hood. I was ignored.The situation should have been handled differently.\n\n1) Before attempting to \""fix\"" my hood latch they should have called me out there and asked how would I go about closing my hood.\n2) explained that my car hood did not close properly\n3) they should have explained to me the potential dangers of my hood not closing properly. Because on 12/24/11 my car hood came up while I was driving on highway. I narrowly avoided a serious accident"
"2","They are friendly professional reliable quick I think that's enough . I keep coming back to them because I trust them."
"1","Honesty today must have been forgotten.  I called ahead prior to showing up here to inquire about a basic oil change.  On the phone I relayed my car model and type and was quoted at $43.  A bit steep for an oil change, but for a place that is suppose to be able to get you in and out in a very short amount of time, I could see the charge.\n\nWhen I arrived, I pulled up, said what I needed, got out of my car, handed over my keys and then went in to sit down and wait.  After only about three minutes a technician came in and told me a nice little story about how my car needed synthetic oil.  And that they were going to charge me $70 for it.  Funny thing was that I had my oil changed before and no one ever told me it NEEDED synthetic oil.  Lies.  When I refused to pay that amount they promptly said that they could knock off $15.  I'm sorry, but $55 is still more than what was quoted to me on the phone.  They then wanted me to sign a waiver to put in regular oil.  I just had to look at them and ask if they heard me.  I again refused, went to work, and found a more reliable place with a better price."
"1","$400 IN DAMAGES\n\nThey cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair. Everything was fine before I brought it here. Mechanic said it looked like they put my bolt in crooked and then hammered it in. Avoid at all cost. They will ruin your car."
"1","Never go to this Jiffy Lube.  They tried to charge me $45 for an oil change- no way! I just asked them to change my headlight bulb, and it took an hour and a half.  They kept taking other peoples car who had come in after me, probably because they weren't making much money off of me.  It took them at least a half hour to actually change the bulb- I looked over and 4 people were under the hood trying to figure it out.  Clearly they have no idea what they are doing because last time I needed this service it was done in 5 minutes.  All of the employees were rude and had an attitude.  I would NEVER go back or recommend this place to anyone!"
"2","Very good service. Came in for an oil change, was informed about other things that might need to be changed in the future, and was not made to feel guilty when I declined. The service worker even gave me a tip about making sure that my toll money is no-where in site when I get my next service change to avoid tempting some dishonest people out there (turns out the corners of a few bills were showing out of one compartment...all bills were still there). He gave me a 10$ discount even though I didn't come in with a coupon, and the oil change was complete in 20 minutes. Will go back."
"1","Terrible experience. I dropped my car off at 9:25 AM on a Saturday and there was one other person in front of me. I didn't leave until 11:05AM and was charged $99 for a synthetic oil changed. Overpriced, terrible customer service, and long wait times. Never coming back here."
"1","I went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change. I waited for an hour and a half, but they were busy, so I understood.  However, as I was driving home my check engine light came on (within 5 minutes of me leaving jiffy lube). I pulled over and read my car manual and it said that it meant there was an emissions problem.  I knew that the jiffy lube guys had taken my air filter out, so I figured they had probably failed to reconnect everything properly. I turned around and went back to jiffy lube. However, when I got there and explained my situation, I was told it would be another 2 hour wait before they could help me. After some back and forth, they called over the manager.  He basically denied any possibility that it could be related to anything they had done, and tried to tell me that my car just happened, coincidentally, to be having some other problem. Finally, he agreed to let me pull up front and hook my car up to the diagnostic machine. They got back a vague error code (p0420 - catalytic efficiency below threshold), denied any responsibility, and sent me on my way. I'm down $50 and still don't know what's wrong with my car.  All I wanted was a simple oil change!!!! I will never, ever go back to a jiffly lube - especially not this one."
"1","Very bad service. They are extremely slow. I waited 90 minutes even though there were just 2 cars in front of me. I bought the signature service which includes vacuuming which they didn't do at all. When I told them that, they just lied and said they did. Never going back here!"
"2","I went here with a couple friends, and we had two appetizers plus our entrees.  The nacho appetizer was great; the beef strips appetizer was not quite up to par for the price.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich--the chicken was grilled just right without being too dry, and the buffalo sauce was perfect (hot, but not overwhelmingly so).  They had a good draft beer selection.  Overall, a good time, I'd certainly go back."
"2","Pittsburgh is a town where \""bar food\"" means the exact same menu in every last place you'd drink a beer, with the fryer in heavy rotation.\n\nMy girlfriend and I both had sandwiches, and they were among the best I ever recall eating.  I had a portabella mushroom sandwich, and at no point did I wish I'd just ordered a burger.  \n\nAs far as bar food goes, this is the best I know.\n\nEdit: Went back and was less impressed; dropping this from 5 to 4 stars.  Nothing particularly wrong, but not in the \""best thing ever\"" category.  Still really solid."
"1","Go there only if you want served uncooked fish, odd tasting salad, or way too sweet tea (btw - no unsweetened)."
"2","Lot 17 is a great little neighborhood bar in Bloomfield. It's places like this which remind me why I love Bloomfield. The patrons know each other, the bartenders know the patrons, and if you are a stranger to the place they will get to know you too. \n\nGreat old time feel here with a wonderful ornate tile ceiling, brick walls, and a beautiful old bar. Beer prices are reasonable with a very wide selection of drafts and bottles, but are by no means the cheapest in the area. I haven't tried much of the food except for the wings, which are good and a safe bet if you don't know what to order. \n\nLot 17 is a PITT bar and a great place to watch a Saturday football game or a basketball game. I also believe that during the basketball season it is host to the Jamie Dixon radio show. Just don't come in here with WVU gear on and you will be just fine!"
"1","I went to Lot 17 Bar and Grill after working late one evening to meet up with some friends. The look of the place is pretty decent with your standard bar seating but with the nice addition of an outdoor seating area which is great to people watch on the bussling streets of Bloomefield.\n\nI arrived last of my party and was starving, thankfully the group had ordered sweet potato fries that came with an amazing cinamon butter for dipping!! And here's where things went south- like I mentioned before I arrived starving and we did not see our waitress for a good 10-15 minutes. When the waitress finally arrived I ordered a diet coke which came out 5-10 minutes later and tasted flat (come on people! Change the machine!) The next time the waitress appeared I quickly ordered the tuna steak salad with cilantro lime dressing which was actually pretty good- it contained won ton strips, a pretty well done piece of tuna which I asked for medium, and an assortment of what tasted to be pretty fresh vegatables. \n\nAs we wrapped up the evening and received our checks we realized that the waitress didn't give me a bill but instead took it upon herself to add my salad to someone else's tab at my table without their heads up. \n\nSadly to say even though my salad was pretty decent, I'm going to have to give them just an ok review due to the terrible service..Here's to Lot 17..I hope you redeem yourself."
"1","I was visiting for the weekend and we were looking for somewhere to go watch the LSU versus Alabama game and we chose Lot 17. When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound."
"2","Bloomfield has so many good places but in my book, Lot 17 stands above the typical bar and restaurant there. I WANT to go to Lot 17. First of all, it's a terrific atmosphere - one that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. A great beer selection with rotating specialities on tap always creates a welcoming feeling in my mind. But its the food that draws me back over and over and over again. The menu is predominantly sandwiches and wraps but the selection is VERY good. There are dinner entrees as well and I've ventured there a few times and was pleasantly surprised.. But the sandwich is king here. Oh yeah, I like 'em!! The jerk chicken with pineapple, provolone, and roasted red peppers is a HUGE hit. The crab cake sandwich is amazingly good - who would have thought?? The jalapeno steak wrap is so good I have a hard time straying from that. I've had about half the list and can tell you I've never regretted my choice. All very good. And they're not shy about size. You'll get full. I've tried their soups too and they're delightful and rich. Another winner. But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fries. Not just typical bar fries, but superb, specialty fries. Your choices are cajun, regular or sweet potato. The Cajuns are coated in a spicy dusting of Cajun seasoning. Yum. The sweet potato fries come with a brown sugar butter dipping sauce that will have you smacking your lip for hours afterwards. You'll wake up dreaming about that sauce. Addicting. I nominate Lot 17 for Best Bar Food in Bloomfield!!"
"1","I visited Lot 17 on an uncommonly warm late Friday in October for lunch with a buddy from work. We were walking down Liberty and went into Lot 17 on a lark. I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.\n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it was totally dead aside from one other table of diners. I figured the place should be bustling since it was such a delightful day outside, but I soon came to realize why the place was a ghost town.\n\nThe simple lunch menu of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and wraps is nice and compact. I chose a turkey burger and regular fries, which arrived in a timely fashion. The fries were tasty... after I salted them. There was absolutely no salt of them when they came out. The turkey burger was seasoned well, but it was dry as a bone. I suspect the turkey patty was frozen, but the burger was so overcooked, I cannot say for sure.\n\nOur server was attentive and friendly. The building is clean, polished, and has some nice HDTVs. \n\nWhen I chose  to go to Lot 17, I figured I was trying it out for the first time. After we ate lunch, I realized I had gone there once in the past for lunch with other co-workers. What does this mean? Lot 17 is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination. Even with my below-average experience, I think the place has potential, but the execution was just not there on my visit. I hope they can step it up at lunch in the future."
"1","Dude. We're over here. No? No eye contact?  Too busy with your iPhone?  \n\nThe bartender was beat. We left without being acknowledged or served (and we literally waived our arms).  Could be good, but who'd know.   Wasn't busy either.  You're fired."
"2","Hey, wanna meet me for a beer?  Sure, where do you wanna go?\n\nYou should really have an easy answer to that question when someone asks you, but lately I haven't.  I've lived in Bloomfield for two years now, and have yet to identify \""my spot.\""  I love the neighborhood -- great restaurants, bars, local business, art spaces, etc.  I like several of the bars, but just haven't figured out which is my go-to spot.  \n\nLast night I asked a friend to meet me for a beer and she suggested Lot 17.  It is literally right around the corner from me.  (And when I say literally, I do NOT mean \""figuratively,\"" which so many people do, by accident I suppose, but they're saying exactly the opposite of what they mean! Grrr)  It's right around the corner, and since I had actually never been in, I thought it was a perfect choice.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the classy wooden decor.  Everything is all really nice hardwood.  It has a very simple style -- the traditional wood, simple chalk board beer list, a couple of nice HD TVs -- none of which stands out or tries too hard to grab your attention.  The bar and a few tables are in the front while several more tables for dining line the back area.\n\nIt was nearly empty.  We were there late -- from about 10-11pm -- on a freezing cold Tuesday night.  A young couple sat quietly at the bar, another guy in the corner chatted up the bartender, and I grabbed a seat a little further down the bar.  I ordered a Full Pint Festivus draft, which is a great brown ale from a brewery in North Versailles that I've heard wonderful things about.  \n\nAfter a few sips my friend came in and joined me.  She had a Guiness, I had another Festivus, we chatted about this and that.  It was quiet, low key, and comfortable.  It's a place that looks really nice yet had a friendly almost dive-y vibe.  I was only there for an hour and no one else was really there, so I shouldn't jump to conclusions.  However, I will definitely be plopping myself down at that classic bar again in the near future, and who knows, maybe Lot 17 will become my neighborhood go-to spot for grabbing a beer on a whim.\n\nThere was a new, shiny, fancy looking, electronic jukebox that I will definitely have to give a try next time!  And obviously I will have to eat there in the future, as I'm seeing several other great reviews"
"1","My Merlot was decent but the calamari was not. The calamari while had hints of Italian seasoning was bland and became soggy of the cooked vegetables that they had underneath it. Plus I think I found a fry or two with the vegetables. Also Lot 17 had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there. Service could have been better. I might return for drinks but only drinks."
"1","I've been here twice and ordered to-go once.  The food is bad!  Last night our table ordered French fries, stuffed portabella mushrooms, and calamari.  The best of the dishes were the mushrooms stuffed w crab meat and topped w red peppers...the fries and calamari were terrible!  I don't want to come back here...it's over priced and the food is below ave"
"2","I always enjoy my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out and grab a beer or enjoy some food in the back. The food is amazing. I especially enjoy the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to any of the burgers, wraps, or sandwiches. Go to Lot 17, you will not regret it."
"2","Lot 17 on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield serves up bar food nirvana!!! It's a pretty small space with plenty of wood surrounding the bar up front and a small booth filled dining room in the back. We've eaten here well over a dozen times and have always enjoyed our experiences here.\n\nThe sandwiches are killer!!!! I enjoy a good chicken sandwich and their Jerk Chicken Sandwich with grilled pineapple, provolone and roasted red peppers may just be my favorite chicken sandwich ever! I've also had the crab cake sandwich which is pretty darned fantastic, too. The jalape\u00f1o steak wrap is so delicious and spicy that it also ranks near the top of delightful choices. It's real steak cooked to order inside, too. The fish tacos are also a tasty option.\n\nI'm not much of a French fry eater unless I'm at Lot 17. Their sweet potato fries are served with a side of brown sugar honey butter dipping sauce that I wish I could make at home. Tried and failed many times. It's the perfect compliment and I now refuse to get sweet potato fries anywhere else because I'd just flat out miss that sauce too much! Occasionally it shows up runny or less than perfect & I get sad but its still better than my best attempt to copy it.\n\nBeer selection is good but could be more extensive. We've sampled some of the items off the appetizer menu in our early days coming here and realized they were totally unnecessary based on the amount of food you receive off the sandwich menu. We did manage to score some free chicken wings by texting Lot 17 using a sign on our booth once. Fun!\n\nOverall, love this bar. We've continually had good service, the food comes out quickly & the prices are reasonable."
"1","My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon, and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \""wet\"" and the Mac and cheese as \""play-doh\"". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\u00f1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there. The chef, however, needs a bit of training."
"2","Atmosphere Nice / Sports on every television with Volume Up Boooooo!\nBread Pudding by far the Bestest in the Burgh!"
"2","The Lot is my spot. Had a party there on Friday night and it was great. We had about 25 people upstairs. John made us fish and a filet and both were really good. We had an open bar for three hours to go along with the food and Lisa waited on us and hustled up and down the stairs all night. All in the total cost was reasonable and we all had a blast. Definitely recommend the lot for your next party of 20 to 25 people."
"2","I came here for the first time Saturday to watch the atrocious pitt vs. UVA football game. We got there early enough to secure Seats at the bar. It got packed quickly once the game started as lot 17 is a true \""pitt\"" bar. Service at the bar was very prompt and friendly despite them being very busy. We started off with an order of garlic jerk wings which were very tasty. Not overly spicy or garlicky and cooked perfectly crisp. I later ordered the Rachael with sweet potato fries. My boyfriend ordered the Reuben with Cajun fries.they have several other menu items that looked good: a salmon blt, crab cake sandwich, turkey club on focaccia, and many burgers that are very good from what my boyfriend says. The Rachael was really good- the rye was marble which I prefer. The sweet potato fries were served with a honey butter that was amazing! He liked his Reuben a lot and the Cajun fries were good but too spicy for my tastes. Beer selection is really stellar too- lots of good craft drafts. This is one of my boyfriends favorite Bars so we will surely be back."
"1","The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.\n\nWe ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.\nPancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.\n\nBah. Cook/waiter was funny, so points for that.\n\nAgain, the only good thing was that it was open when I wanted food."
"2","Don't let the outside fool you! My girlfriend used to live in Bloomfield and we discovered it by just walking in looking for something cheap. The place is tiny but it doesn't matter because the food is good and the portions are big and most importantly it's cheap. I always got the $3.95 breakfast at least I think it was $3.95 all I know is it costs less than $5 for a meal. The staff are friendly and you don't wait long for your food. Wish I could go more often but I can never remember the hours as they are open later at night than during the day."
"1","A great option when there are no other options.  If you find yourself devastatingly hungry in Bloomfield at 3am to drunk to drive or walk ANYPLACE else, sure, go for it.  Otherwise, take a pass- your insides will thank you in the morning.  The times I have eaten here have induced self loathing  of the worst kind..  the only thing worse are the stomach cramps brought on as a result- but I was drunk and it seemed like a good idea at that moment."
"2","Mama Ros's (sic) is a great place to eat late at night or early in the morn. They have weird hours, weird cooks, weird customers, and great food. \n\nThe price is great and the silver dollar pancakes are soooo good."
"2","Nice, cheap diner food with a great, homie little vibe. Plenty of interesting people drop through all the time, and there's always good conversation.\n\nThe service is occasionally a bit slow when the diner fills up, but it's not usually much of a problem. The food isn't exemplary, but considering the restaurant's very reasonable prices, it feels like a deal.\n\nI stop by a couple times a week, would definitely recommend it."
"2","If you're into diner food and unpretentious plates, then this is the place for you. (And me, and everyone alike.)\n\nThe Sandwich Shop doesn't look like that much from the outside but the warmth and atmosphere that Mama Ros and Mike put into it, is something amazing. \n\nJust had some coffee, and a modest plate of over-easy eggs with rye bread--but the eggs were cooked perfectly and the coffee great. If I remember correctly, you can customize your pancakes etc... Yes. A million times yes.\n\nI'll be sure to pay Mama Ros a second visit if I'm ever in Bloomsfield again. So should you."
"1","This place has the worst french fries I have ever tasted. They were literally BLACK. All I tasted was burnt oil. My photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the French fries that I was sent home with. I could not even eat one! I also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon. The grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down, like it did not match up...One piece of bread was the opposite way than the other. Also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks were delicious. 1 out of 3 is not great. My sister raved about this place. I am so disappointed. Disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I spent $30 for only one edible thing worth $4. So pissed!"
"1","Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring.  Eggplant parm was a little better than average.  But all in all, not any more exciting than what I can make for myself with a jar of sauce and box of pasta."
"2","The food - bruschetta and fried ravioli apps, side salad, 1/2 order of aglio olio, and rice pudding - was pretty good. The aglio olio and rice pudding were the best parts of the meal. The service was good. Everyone was friendly. The interior could use some sprucing, but, all in all, it was good Italian food. I'll be back for the half-priced wine!"
"1","I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \n\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \""Italian\"" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.\n\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere."
"1","Not real Italian. When there's a crab dish on the menu and you don't let your customers know this there's a problem. Imitation crab meat at an Italian restaurant doesn't fly. I was hoping for some good Italian while out of town and was truly disappointed. The bar service was extremely friendly about my compliant and did remove that dish from my bill. My entree was pasta and shrimp. I haven't paid $20 for a dish of pasta and 5 large shrimp in a long time. Don't worry but I won't come close to this restaurant again."
"1","I wasn't really a fan. In fact, this may hae been some of the most sub-par Italian food I've had (it seemed very touristy), and it was definitely my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh while traveling there on business the past few months. Cute ambiance! Cute neighborhood! Friendly local wait staff! But kinda touristy & uninteresting food pairings / ingredients."
"1","Looking at all the other reviews about this place, I wondered if we actually went to the same place.  I thought it wasn't very good.  I had the Eggplant Alexander which consisted of a bunch of soggy fried eggplant with a ton of cheese melted on it.  I've made much better at home.  My beloved had veal Parmesan.   Which was dry, overcooked and lukewarm.  Did we catch them on a bad day?  I'll never know because I don't think we'll return."
"1","I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one of those places where the food gets worse every time you go there.  Today, half the lettuce I had on my Caesar salad was rotten.  I have no idea why it ever left the kitchen.  And it was take-out, too, so there wasn't much I could do about it after driving all the way home.  (They gave me the wrong entr\u00e9e too, but at least it was edible.)\n\nI finally think I'm done with this place."
"2","I have been coming to Alexander's  off and on for almost 25 years. I think in all that time I have only had one meal that was below par. Pretty good average I'd say. I went the other night with my adult daughter. I had the calamari with pasta, a cocktail ( yum, yum), and a garden salad. The salad was very fresh and arrived promptly. The cocktail was strong but great. The calamari arrived quickly and was piled so high on the plate I could barely see over the plate! It was served on what tasted like fresh tomatoes over the pasta. It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, even after I was full. \n\nMy daughter had the salad too with linguini and clam sauce. It was loaded with clams. They were tasty and not rubbery. She suspected they were canned but since they were tender it was okay. The sauce was fragrant too, not fishy. \n\nOur server was super efficient and polite. She kept up with us without being intrusive. The decor of the restaurant has been updated a bit over time. It's cute. A bit too bright for an Italian restaurant if you ask me, but I'm from New England where Italian places are all dimly lit. \n\nOverall, a wonderful, easy going, friendly  neighborhood place to go to relax over some good food and drink. Have a few laughs without a tv interrupting your dinner conversation. You have to sit in the bar for that. Take your mom. Take the family. Take your husband when you can't stand another night of cooking. Just go it alone and who cares about anyone else?! Just have fun eating some really good food that tastes like someone cares."
"1","I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! \n\nOn Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended the 50th birthday party for my dear friend, David Flynn. I organized the party, but relied on Dave and his sister to provide me with the final head count. I made the reservation for 25 people.\n\nThe manager and I played phone tag for the two days before the event. I called back and left messages TWICE to confirm, but apparently he never got my messages. (This was part of his rant, his indignation at unreturned phone calls that actually HAD been returned!)\n\nThe dinner started at 7 PM. Most of our group arrived on time, but some of our group (including me) arrived between 8 PM-9 PM. I was working on a homemade birthday present for Dave, which took longer than expected. I called Dave, his sister and my friends (Reesa & Joel) to tell them I was running late. In hindsight, I should have also called the restaurant to let them know, and for that I am truly sorry. That still doesn't justify the manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nAfter enjoying a delicious dinner, drinks and birthday cake, none of us had a clue that anything was wrong. If the decision to return to a restaurant were based SOLELY on the food and wait staff, I would definitely return to Alexander's. But sadly, when the manager has a nuclear meltdown and throws a 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, it tends to sour one on returning to a restaurant.\n\nTowards the end of our dinner, some of us started to smell cigarette smoke, which we later realized was coming from the patio out front. (It was a warm night, and they had the front sliding-glass doors open.) In the midst of the smoke discussion, the manager approached our table and began an EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!!\n\nHe was angry that everyone in our group hadn't arrived at exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen is open till 10 PM on Sat. night, so I don't understand why this was a big deal. We ended up with 20 people total and 5 no-shows. I am always disappointed by no-shows, but I explained this possibility to the manager when I made the reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! \n\nBTW...the dining room was practically EMPTY, which is not what I would expect on a Saturday night in Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm not the first customer to be on the receiving end of the manager's meltdown.\n\nThe manager SCREAMED that he had called me twice, and I hadn't called him back! He ranted about this about a dozen times. I told him I HAD called him back - TWICE. It's not my fault if he didn't get my messages. \n\nHe SCREAMED that he had put an extra waitress and cook on staff because he expected 25 people. He SCREAMED that I had cost the restaurant $100! How much money do you think 20 people spent on appetizers, dinner and drinks? I find it hard to believe that they didn't make any money, or at least break even. \n\nI am sorry that there were 5 no-shows in our group, but I always thought Saturday night was the busiest night of the week for most restaurants. I didn't realize the restaurant would look like a deserted, old western ghost town with hardly any customers. On a Saturday night, I assumed they would have a full staff on duty with or without my reservation. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm not perfect.\n\nThe manager also YELLED at me and my friends for \""LOOKING COMFORTABLE\"" in his restaurant!!! Since when is looking comfortable an OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted you to feel comfortable, but apparently not at Alexander's.\n\nHe also SCREAMED that one of the waitresses only got a $1.00 tip! I found that hard to believe, but just in case he wasn't making it up, I tipped my waitress $35 on my $26 dinner check! I am a former waitress, and I would feel HORRIBLE if any waitress every got ripped off on my watch! Even if his story wasn't true, I figured she deserved an extra big tip just for having to WORK in such a horrible place where the manager YELLS at paying customers!!! If he treats the customers this way, I can only imagine how he treats the employees. \n\nTHE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During his rant, he actually SCREAMED that he never wanted to see me in his restaurant ever again! I'm happy to grant him that wish. And so are my friends. \n\nThis is an example of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever witnessed in my entire life!!! I thought the manager was going to have a heart attack or a stroke the way he was SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES!\n\nSCREAMING at paying customers is completely unacceptable behavior, and I will NEVER eat at Alexander's ever again. It's really a shame because I loved their salmon with pesto sauce. But great food can't make up for a manager who throws a TEMPER TANTRUM and SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, you can smell smoke in the dining room, which sucks. My friends and I are BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!"
"2","I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant bringing 8 out of town guests from across the country. The food was outstanding and the wait staff is very accommodating. Alex made a special effort to make sure our time there was enjoyable. Good authentic Italian cuisine at a very reasonable price."
"1","Suffice it to say, this is not real Italian food and it's below average and overpriced when it comes to American-Italian food. The staff was excellent though and you will have great service and conversation. Thanks but probably won't be back."
"2","Very nice classic Pittsburgh neighborhood Italian.  Best choice for hearty, simple popular Italian dishes  I took my parents there for dinner and we all enjoyed our meal.  My mom loved her chicken parm.  My clam sauce with whole wheat pasta was absolutely perfectly al-dente.  Salad is fresh with a very nice balsamic vinagrette.  Wedding soup was a bit salty, but otherwise perfectly fit my conception of what wedding soup should be.  Dad had the tortilla soup (I know; odd choice) and he liked it quite a bit.  Standout item was the beans & greens which were very fresh.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere is a bit dated and very Pittsburgh, but if you are looking for decent American Italian at good prices with good service, highly recommend."
"1","Crappy, boring, limpid. \n\nThe pastrami tasted bland, the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting, and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar, and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines - a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. \n\nHow is this place \""famous\""? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand-slice it?"
"1","If you're famous, why is there never anyone in your restaurant?  Seriously, I live right around the corner, and I've never seen more than one customer in there at a time, and it's completely empty about 3/4 of the time I walk or drive by.  As one other reviewer rightly pointed out, Sammy's seems to be famous for claiming to be famous.\n\n(Note: this is for a visit about ten months earlier - could've sworn I'd already written one.)  I'd been walking/driving past Sammy's for several months after moving into the neighborhood when I decided to finally hoof it over and try one of their \""famous\"" corned beef sandwiches.  The sandwich itself was, well, mediocre at best.  There was a decent amount of meat, but it was pretty average.  The other ingredients were also...average - certainly nothing that would generate \""fame\"" because of its flavor.  \n\nService was the usual gruff, put-upon treatment I've come to expect from small businesses in da 'Burgh.  Prices were okay, but no great bargain.  I haven't been back.\n\nThree stars for the sammich, 1.5 for the rest."
"2","One of my favorite Thai places, maybe ever.  Fresh, sweet, spicy and all around good.  Not super heavy or cloying sweet.  Friendly service and all at a fair price.  \n\nI hate hearing my neighbors, though."
"2","well i finally took the advice of fellow yelpers and gave Thai Cuisine a shot last weekend.   I showed up at 930 on Friday night and the place was packed.  I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)"
"2","First visit to Thai Cuisine (interesting name, no?) and first visit to Pittsburgh, so that should set up this review nicely. Context is, of course, that I expected very little from this town, yet I've been completely surprised. #1 - faux meat on a menu is a huge plus for me, I just love it, and I don't care to hear comments like \""if you are a vegetarian, why would you eat something that is meant to taste and look like meat?\"" Shut up. I just like it. #2 - the prices are so cheap. I only looked at the vegetarian menu where every entree is about $10 for dinner, and while that's no steal nor does it compare to Thai food prices in Thailand, it's decent. #3 - cutest. waitress. ever. AND she mentioned that \""all of my cool friends have read that book\"" which, by default, makes me a cool kid? Hmmm. Maybe. Then again, maybe not."
"2","Best Thai food in town, for sure.  Screw all those other places, they're inferior and probably cost way more.\n\nThe green curry is my favorite thing, but the yellow curry is pretty good.  There are vegetarian options (although I usually go for the meat), and one time they had a salmon tom kha gai soup special, which I wasn't sure was a good idea, but it was actually a terrific idea.\n\nOne of the few places I can take any or all of my family or in-laws and be sure that everyone will enjoy themself.\n\nThe name kind of lends itself to semi-comedic confusion, though:\n\""Where do you want to go for dinner?\""\n\""How about Thai Cuisine?\""\n\""Thai sounds great.  Where do you want to go?\""\n\""Um... Thai Cuisine?\""\n(Wash, rinse, repeat...)"
"2","Delicious-- try the spicy basil noodles.  Really relaxed atmosphere, nice low lighting, friendly staff.  Your water glass will never get more than a third empty!  \n\nOh, sometimes I really miss Pittsburgh."
"2","What's not to love about Thai Cuisine?  Relaxed and spacious atmosphere.  Friendly hosts who will humor you if you try to speak Thai to them, and of course great Thai food. \n\nThey were even kind enough to offer me a generous handful of Kaffir lime leaves when I wanted to try my own hand at some Thai cookin!"
"2","Pretty good Thai, though slightly overrated. Hit and miss, with the curries more solid than anything else I've tried. Enormous portions.\n\nAmbience is very open and casual but somehow still pretty \""nice\"". Seating is never an issue.\n\nIt's good to have more BYOB options. Go here with some friends casually, bring a growler or a couple of bombers, have a good relaxed time. Overall, I'm a fan, but wish my friends would want to go here less often."
"2","When I lived in Pittsburgh, I was always trying to find the best Thai restaurant. I failed miserably. So when I visited for July 4th, I had a friend take me to her favorite place. This was it! and I was grateful!\n\nI went with about 8 people and we BYOB'ed which was a fantastic idea. Some semi-sweet white wine went well with the flavorful light Thai food. Most of the table had the curries(I thought the red was the best), but I went with the eggplant with the vegetarian duck. Simply delicious! Highly highly recommend it. The spicy basil sauce was the highlight. My partner had one of the chef specials, which was by far the most interesting, but maybe not the tastiest. \n\nOverall, an affordable, low-fuss, great place to eat. There also seemed to be a steady crowd there when we got there and left. It looks like a popular spot. For good reason!"
"2","Thai Cuisine is one of the best Thai places I've been to in the States - finding it in Pittsburgh was a real surprise.  The food here is outstanding, and the service is comparable to what I'd expect in a $50/person restaurant, and this place is definitely not $30/plate.  With appetizers, Thai iced tea, and two entrees, my girlfriend and I paid about $30.\n\nI highly recommend the cold chicken and sprout salad.  Wish I could remember the name of it, because it's heavenly.  (...Which probably assumes that heaven looks like Thailand.  ...Which would be a nice place to spend eternity.)  Thai iced tea is really good, too."
"2","Like other reviewers have said, this place is very basic but the service is fast and friendly and the food was amazing. The vegetarian Tom Yum soup was perfect! We ordered the special of the day - a fried trout dish which was incredible. The price was very reasonable too. The six year old in our party (who doesn't like spicy food) loved the fried dumpling which was recommended by our server and one of the house specialties - three flavored chicken. We ordered the banana springroll for desert - also tasty. Don't expect a fancy place but if you want really good and fast thai food, this is the place to go in Pittsburgh."
"2","I'm not a Thai food expert, but I really really enjoy their food.  The 3 spice duck is great, Pad Thai is fantastic, as well as almost all the appetizers.  The servers are so nice and accommodating.  The decor could use updating.  Closed on Tuesdays, which somehow is always the day I'm craving it."
"1","i was very excited to try this place.  thai is one of my favorite cuisines ever!!!  but i was sorrily disappointed. we started with spring rolls, through the rice wrapper i could see that the lettuce was browning, a sure sign that the rolls were not made to order.  the pad thai was dry and tasteless.  my friends curry and potatoes tasted like water with a touch of curry powder.  i hate giving poor reviews but nothing that i ate at thai cuisine was yummy."
"2","After moving from SF to Denver about 1.5 years ago, I've missed good Thai food.  Luckily, I've found myself in Pittsburgh for a week for work.  I found Thai Cuisine on Yelp and loved it!  I took a short drive from my hotel, near CMU campus, across a bridge into a very authentic little Pittsburgh neighborhood.  As soon as I saw their special, Winter Curry, (Green Curry that includes Kabocha Squash, Zucchini, Potatoes, Carrots, Chicken), I was thrilled.  And, after tasting this scrumptiousness, I was hooked for life!  I gave 4 stars and not 5 only due to it not being an amazing environment...but for food only, definitely a 5 star!\nHaven't left Pitt yet but already excited for a return trip for more yummy Thai!"
"2","Very solid Thai place. I have the fried spring rolls, which was good (crispy flaky crust, but the filling wasn't anything to write about), the vegetarian tom yum soup (pretty good, but honestly I've had better tasting broth), and the winter curry.  The curry was interesting, but the kabocha squash (which i'm a fan of) didn't seem to fit in right with the curry.  The curry itself was good and the dish was a good effort.  My gf had the vegetarian pad thai.  She thought it was good, but a little too soupy (too much fluid).\n\nAlso, they offer most things spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  They said 5 is good, but I tasted almost no spice.  I'd go for a 10 next time.\n\nFrom what I read this places is among the best in Pitt, and I can see how this might be true.  Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll definitely consider coming back."
"2","Took a friend to chow down at this thai restaurant. \n\nPROS: Have had the pad thai, wide noodles w/ black bean sauce, and mango curry here. All were good. The front desk was very welcoming. Decent prices ($10- 12/dish). They also have a daily specials menu, at least for dinner.  \n\nCONS: Crab rangoon was overfried- wouldn't recommend this appetizer. Side street parking. \n\nOverall, will be back to check out the rest of the menu."
"2","DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER.\n\nA hidden gem, this place is phenomenal - best Thai food I've ever had. You need to go here."
"1","I agree 100% on Maggie G's review. Over priced, bad food, and Pittsburgh DOESN'T know GOOD Thai food.. Plus $40 bucks on Take out...seriously? Ill pass I've had better Thai for less. \n\nYellow Curry (Ive added a picture of exactly how watery the curry truly is ) \n(x2) Spring Rolls (2 per order)\nDumplings (5 per order) \nWontons (4/5 per order)\n_____________\n\n40 BUCKS\n\nIll stick to Bangkok Balcony. No more trying out different Thai places in the city. I rather not waste my money on watered down curries and bland dishes which seems to be the norm for the Pittsburgh Thai scene."
"2","Our favorite place in Pittsburgh for Thai food! Service is excellent!!! We're kind of regulars now and we always get lucky to be served by this white guy who is awesome and polite. Their food is a little expensive but its so good. Try their tum yum veggie soup!!!! My favorite!"
"2","I didn't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent."
"2","My wife and I have been coming to Thai Cuisine for many years now even though it's almost a 2.5 hours drive from our house (round trip). We both love Thai food and Thai Cuisine is still the best we've ever had (2nd best so far is in Virginia Beach, VA).\n\nTheir Pad See Ew, Three Flavor Chicken, and Thai Spring Rolls are our regular favorites. We also love having their Mango Sticky Rice for desert when it is in season."
"1","blandest thai food in pittsburgh I think.  You could really just walk down a few blocks and spend less for better food.  I think the only people that like the food are vegatarians since they have fake meats.  Their sauces literally are all the same, their curries are bad, and everything is way more expensive than it should be.  Their new facade is ugly as can be too.  It looks like someone used some old floor tile from a kitchen and used it as brick for the front of the building.  Looked way better before.\nD-"
"2","Pretty good and decently priced for a Thai place. I was sick when I went there (the ginger tea helped me quite a bit). The wait staff was very friendly and came over to ask if we needed anything on a regular basis even though it was close to 10pm.\n\nSpicy noodles were great. We also ordered the lychee curry, which I thought was ok, but nothing too spectacular. All in all a good place for decent thai food in pittsburgh."
"1","They only deliver through WheelDeliver.com"
"2","Oh my, Thai Cuisine, how I miss living a few blocks from you.  \nThis is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I couldn't even begin to count the number of times that I have been to this place. I mean it when I say everything is delicious.  I have had multiple curries, noodles, and apps, and none have disappointed.\nA few of my favorites, Chicken Dumplings (steamed or fried), Thai Spring Rolls, Pad Thai (naturally), Thai Cuisine Bird Nest, and Spicy Basil Noodles.  \nService here is always on point, even when they're busy.  This place is BYOB, so bring your favorite adult bevie and enjoy. While a smaller restaurant, they happily can accommodate larger parties. \nWhile they don't deliver, you can get take out, so you can bring home a yummy Thai treat.\n\nI need to go here again asap!!! :)"
"1","Let me start this by saying I got on the wrong bus and ended up walking from Garfield to Bloomfield and then once in Bloomfield I proceeded to get lost behind West Penn Hospital. With that being said I was hoping that all my stumbling around in the elements would not be in vain.   \n\nThe food at Thai Cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops and calamari in a Thai chili sauce. The sauce is my favorite part of a Thai meal but Thai Cuisine came up short here. What I enjoy must about a Thai chili sauce is the complexity of flavors but this sauce in my dish was your standard thin runny brown sauce.  The kind that comes with lets say beef and broccoli.  I think the menu description was misleading and had I known it would be brown sauce I would have ordered something else.  \n\nSome of the onions in my dish were cold which leads me to believe that the food was not cooked to order or at least not all of it.  There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the calamari tasted great, but the dish lacked flavor. The carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition.\n\nFor my hubby I ordered the Thai steak , it tasted like a frozen salisbury steak dinner and salisbury steak just so happens to be one my least favorite foods.  Had I not sampled his dinner this would have been a solid three star review. \n\nI see no reason to go back here."
"2","Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles..."
"2","If you live in Pittsburgh, you may understand how contentious the issue of \""favorite local Thai restaurants\"" is.\n\nSo, I'll begin this review w/ my personal bias: Thai Cuisine is our go-to Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. This is in part due to proximity, but the relationship is on no small part sustained through friendly staff and consistent dining experiences.\n\nThai Cuisine is -- as my wife and I like to put it --\u00a0a rainy-Sunday-evening type place. Their curry broths are great, the apps are tasty, but not too filling, and the ambiance -- particularly after their recent renovations --\u00a0is warm and inviting.\n\nI'll admit, that if your'e in it purely from a culinary angle, there may be better options, but for the buck, you won't find many that beat Thai Cuisine."
"2","Excellent Thai food. The red curry, crab fried rice and Pad Thai were very good as was the seafood soup.  Service was awesome!"
"2","The coconut curries served in ceramic pots are all delicious. The red curry is probably my favorite. Also worth mentioning are the spicy basils stir fry, the spicy basil noodles, and the three flavor chicken. My family goes here for birthdays, Christmas Eve, and anytime we have guests in town. There isn't a bad thing in the menu. \n\nSpicy scale is 1-10: ask for the spice caddy with pickled jalape\u00f1os. \n\nPRO-TIP: Go for lunch and your entree comes with a salad w/ peanut dressing, and rice- all under 10 dollars. \n\nTalk to Lisa about what to order. She is a wonderful restrauntuer and a great lady."
"2","If you're looking for straight-forward good Thai food then Thai Cuisine is the place to go. No frills, BYOB, no spa-like music simple Thai. It was quite good-I can't say it was an over the moon astounding, mind blowing, life changing experience, but it was good and what you want when you go for Thai food. \n\nMy husband had the spicy duck and it had good flavor, although more of a 5 than 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. Really good. \n\nI had spicy noodles chillin' at my standard 7 on the 1-10 scale. I can't complain. The noodles were great and the vegetables were deliciously cooked (I tend to go vegetarian). \n\nI will say the dumplings and spring rolls we had as appetizers were a notch above what we've had elsewhere in Pitt. \n\nWe will definitely go back!"
"2","Top Tier Thai.  Best Green Curry in the city.\n\nWe've been there twice, once for lunch, and once for dinner.  Both were great, with nice service, and excellent food.  \n\nThe big hit the first time was the Tofu Green Curry.  Every restaurant in the city that has a \""Vegetarian Option\"" on the menu needs to go here and try this dish.  It is so good, with each ingredient having its own place in the dish.  Not just a mash of veggies in a thick green curry.  Truly one of the best curries I've ever had.  It makes a dish that has become boring in most other places truly exciting.  We had it again the second time and it was exceptional again.\n\nOur second dish was a whole spicy fish, which was also very good, and a nice compliment to the curry.  First time, at lunch, I think I had a shrimp prik pow, and that was also very nice.\n\nThe Ginger Tea is also great.  \n\nAs we were finishing dinner last time, I commented that the curry is so good that next time we'd have to try the Pad Thai.  That's a dish we hardly ever get when its just the two of us, because it can be a bit generic, a safe choice for those that don't know or really like Thai food.  But it IS the national dish of a truly world-class cuisine, and given what they do with the green curry, we thought, \""I bet it's really something special\""\n\nAs we were leaving, the owner thanked us for coming, and as we discussed the meal a bit she said \""Oh, you have to try the Pad Thai!  The best in the city!\""  I bet that's true, and can't wait to have another dish that's usually a bit of a yawn, turn out to be a real surprise in the hands of this great Thai restaurant."
"2","very delicious and good service. byob, which is a dream. love this place."
"2","I will start my review by saying that I am not a Thai food expert, but I love Thai Cuisine!  My friends have a hard time talking me into trying any other Thai restaurant as I keep coming back here.  I'm hooked!"
"2","Been back several times and it's still our favorite Thai in Pittsburgh. The pad Thai is very good, with a slight smoky flavor that keeps you coming back for more. It's a light pad this, not thick and gloopy, so your friends who only know to eat the pad Thai (assuming you have such friends) won't feel overloaded by their dinner. \n\nI now know not to eat green curry anywhere else! Did that recently on a trip to England and was bummed."
"2","The Tom Kha is delicious. All of the curry's hit the spot as well, my favorite is the red bean. Thai Cuisine has many traditional dishes as well, don't be afraid to try something you've never had before. As far as my decade of experience goes here, all of the food is good."
"2","As the saying goes, when one Thai food door closes, another Thai food door opens...\n\nIt was Sunday afternoon. We were hungry and we wanted Thai. We walked up to Thai Gourmet, our usual go-to Thai spot, and were greeted by a \""closed\"" sign on the door. They don't open until 5 on Sundays?!  But I want Thai food NOWWWWW (feeling very Veruca Salt that day). Dejected, I walked my rumbly tummy up Liberty Ave, and lo and behold, another Thai restaurant appears a few blocks up. Whine and ye shall receive.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, we decide to take out some chicken pad thai and another dish called \""three flavored chicken.\"" Both solid choices. The pad thai portion was huge and chock full of the good stuff (they did not skimp on the meat or veggies in here!)  The sauce was flavorful and plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, or sticky, as some pad thai sauces can be. The \""three flavored chicken\"" was also tasty with its crispy, breaded chunks of white meat chicken. The sauce was interesting and unlike anything I've ever had before. Despite its name, I really only tasted two flavors that dominated the sauce -- vinegar (sour) and sugar (sweet). It could have used some spice to round it out, but even so, it was still delicious. I do wish it had some broccoli or other vegetable in it so I at least felt a little less guilty about eating copious amounts of fried chicken chunks :)  And overall, for our tastes, both dishes definitely could have kicked up the spice intensity. We had ordered both at a level 8, and as I said, I couldn't really detect any spice at all. So if that was an 8, next time I'll probably order a 33. :)\n\nOverall, this is very yummy Thai food. I'm not sure that it will replace my usual go-to Thai spot, but it'll definitely be high on my list!"
"1","Okay Thai food, nothing special, and overpriced. Ordered the eggplant with shrimp, veggie fried rice, and chicken satay. Eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp. The veggie fried rice and chicken satay were both substandard as far as other Thai food restaurants in the area. It is pricier than most other Thai places in the area and based on the quality, I would not recommend."
"2","Seems like a very nice neighborhood restaurant and bar. A bit on the expensive side for me with dinner probably in the $15 - 30 range when all is said and done.\n\nThat much said I had the Prime Rib and it was very tasty along with a simple baked potato. \n\nGood service. Plenty of parking in their own lot."
"2","Great food, never had a bad meal there.  I love that they get their desserts from Signature Desserts."
"1","Don't waste your money!!! \nWhen I moved to Brookline about 8 years ago, I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant. We always went for wing night, and the wings were very large and quite tasty. My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location.  The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes...a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \""specials\"" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \""special\"" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away, and give your money to a local establishment that is more deserving of your money!"
"1","Hi, Every Year since I moved here to Pittsburgh since 2003 we went to the Getaway for St Patrick's Day. 3 years ago the food was terrible, but upon taking the extra order back to the restaurant the next day the owner was very nice & refunded some of my money & promised next year would be great!, It was as he said Great, but this Year was so disappointing my family & I will never go back! The staff was very nice, but we waited 20 mins for a table as we were seated at 6pm the waitress asks us for our order & 2 out of 3 of us had our heart set on the traditional Corn beef n Cabbage dinner, her reply was we are out of that for a while now! That info should have been given to us before we waited to be seated so we could have gone elsewhere, and My dinner was \""Irish Lamb Stew\"" I counted the lamb pieces in that stew I got 4 tiny little chunks so I paid for mashed potatoes & lamb gravy it was terrible and expensive. Avoid Them on St. Pat's Day Band was Terrible as well!"
"1","Note the date on this review because, yes, this place used to be awesome. I keep giving it chances and now i am DONE. I just had the worst meal ever here. It is the NV salad. It used to be my favorite and i would come once a week back in the day. This salad was so nasty...they forgot the cheese...forgot the salsa and sour cream...it was disgusting. Ad the draft beer is luke warm. Not surprising it was empty when it used to be packed on friday night for dinner."
"1","Very strange place. Idk what was going on but I went in around 12 pm and there are tons of young kids (5-8) running around the bar. Not a big deal just thought it odd. Got a huge plate of nachos were alright. The rest of us got assorted hoagies. Just meh sorta flavorless. And side dishes tasted as if they were made a long time ago. Good place 4 a large group to drink get apps tho."
"1","I haven't been to the Getaway in a few years, and now I remember why.  Aside from my hubby, who got a burger and fries, we were all rather underwhelmed with our dishes.  Once upon a time this place used to be really good.  Now not so much."
"1","This is one of those places that you really really WANT to like, especially if you live nearby.  I have been mostly underwhelmed by the food,except for their desserts which are perfection.  They have a very ambitious menu which perhaps does not give the cooks time enough to really focus on making fewer items really well. Sometimes the dinners are good, sometimes they are not. The salads are good.  I would only go there to meet a friend for a drink or attend an event that you are invited to, going there as dinner date is a real gamble, even if you do have a groupon."
"2","My boyfriend and I stopped into the Getaway last night to catch the last two periods of the Pens vs. Kings game. We arrived around 7:30 and it wasn't crowded so we took a couple of seats at the bar. Rose, the bartender, was quick to ask us what we wanted to drink. Of course I chose a Southern Tier 2X IPA and he chose a Yuengling, Rose knew all of her regulars and was friendly with everyone. The owners were actually sitting at the bar at the same time and seemed to know most of the regulars as well. For my meal, I ordered the getaway signature wrap (romaine lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, diced chicken, mandarin oranges and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic dressing). I asked for no walnuts and a nice surprise as well was the fact that there were craisins in the wrap too. With just the right amount of balsalmic spread throughout the wrap, this was very tasty. I chose fries as my side and those were good as well. My boyfriend has eaten here several times and said the wings (particularly the cajun) are tasty as is the quesadilla (which is so huge you can order just a half), and the Reuben, however, last night he chose the steak hoagie (Thin sliced grilled sirloin and provolone \ncheese on a toasted 8\"" hoagie roll with lettuce and tomatoes). He said it was tasty and he would order it again. Their desserts are from Signature desserts and they all looked delicious! We chose the pumpkin cheesecake. It had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and was not overpowering. A very tasty seasonal treat! It's hard to find a combination of good service and good food and we found it here so we will be back in the future."
"1","I feef that the waitress was not trained correctly and she should never have been fired"
"2","Fiori's is always great pizza - especially when you're on the way home from town and hungry.  It's open late, and usually packed on the weekends.  My recommendation, however, is to go to Campitis (a few blocks away, on Potomac Ave in Dormont) if it's not too late, as they have the best pizza in Dormont.  But you'll never go wrong here, either. Quick, good pizza, and always a pleaser."
"2","A south hills legend.  The only problems are a total lack of parking and long wait but a great pizza if you can be patient."
"2","This is a dive.  A true dive.  The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.  \n\nIt really doesn't matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won't come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven't arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!\n\nWith the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don't stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don't follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:\n\nFirst Trip only:\nGarlic bread\nHot wings\n\nBoth Trips:\nMeatballs (x2) and red sauce\nPepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\"" - 8 cut)\n\nThe meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.  \n\nOur pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.  \n\nI must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn't unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...  \n\nThey only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.\n\nNOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won't like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork."
"1","First I must clarify that my rating here is based on my scale of pizza-ratings only. This pizza is certainly edible, but it is not at the top of my pizza-scale, a place reserved for the Grimaldis and Lombardis of the world (or, more realistically, just the U.S.; Italian pizza, I have heard and trust, is even better).\n\nFiori's is just underwhelming. I had family from New Jersey visiting and we were looking to grab a few pies after exploring around town. Piccolo Forno was unfortunately closed so I looked to the trusty internet to help me find something near our location that had a good reputation. Fiori's was a popular choice with decent ratings, so we headed over that way. The restaurant space is cramped and only conducive to tables of 4 guests or less in a party. Service was helpful, friendly, and quick. But the pizza just fell flat. The sauce was so sweet, which is not normal outside of this region (not sure what sweet tomato sauce is about, but I don't dig it. There has to be sugar added or something.). Dough was ok but wasn't that perfect medium for the simple yet magical tomato and mozzarella combination that it ought to be. If you are expecting New York style pizza, this is NOT the place for you. Average at best, but better than your fast-food pizza places if you are in a pinch. For me, that will be never."
"2","When I heard about the slightly sweet sauce served on a Fiori's Pizza, I was doubtful about whether or not this would be a place for me. I have to say overall I liked it- but with a few caveats.\n\nParking stinks.  Don't bother eating in, just get take out. Grab a friend, have them drive and run in to pick up your pie. My quick bite of pizza took over two hours from finding a parking space, standing in line to order, waiting for my pizza to be made, getting a table with said pizza (there is very limited seating for eating in), eating and finally wriggling past the other waiting people to get out to search for the car. The place is CASH ONLY, no credit cards so make sure you got a twenty to buy your pie. (Fortunately they have an ATM on site but the fees!)\n\nAll my complaints aside, I did enjoy my pizza. The sweetness of the sauce was balanced by the saltiness of the olives they exuberantly provided on my pizza. The crowd of people in there provided for a quite interesting people-watching experience. The slices of pizza were unevenly divided and my eating companions were quick to grab what might have been fold-able slices, but I feel like folding was a possibility for the crust.\n\nOverall, I'd go back."
"1","I have to admit, I've never physically been inside Fiori's, but I've had their pizza several times. In a word: forgettable.\n\nThe last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former. \n\nOverall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold, for breakfast."
"1","It was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat.  Stopped by Fiori's, haven't been there in years.  Yes, it was crowded but got a table and ordered pizza and wings.  \n\nThe pizza was hard to chew the crust was hard, the cheese was too!  The pizza was just sweet without much other taste, almost like ketchup!  Definitely not a fan of sweet pizza...I don't know why it is so popular but most people tend to like sweet food and drinks...but not me...I want some flavors and spice!\n\nThe wings were so average....not anything I would order again....my son ate one and said he was done...amazing!\n\nI know! I know! this place is popular, but it is just is not for me!"
"2","My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.\n\nFiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.\n\nBut then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh."
"2","This is Mecca... I don't know why it's so good. The sauce is really sweet, the best thing I can compare it to is spaghetti O's sauce... respectively.  But when it meets the crust and pepperoni or the \""out of this world sausage\"" ... magic happens. I would reccommend pep, sausage and onion. It's in a class of it's own. Trust me."
"2","CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE ON CHEESE\n\ni love fioris."
"2","I've travel 52 weeks per year. I grew up in Pittsburgh, lived in Chicago for 5 years came back this year.  Been to Italy, New York...Fiori's is the best.  Sauce is great, cheese is great, service is always friendly and entertaining.  I have been going here for 20 years."
"2","What can you say about Fiori's. i'm going to just start throwing out some words and stop me when you get the point. \n\nlegendary, awesome, fantastic, sweet, cheese...oh so much cheese...., epic, beautiful, famous, iconic, local, unique, different, quality...... I think you get the point. \n\nFiori's is all of those things and more. They are, in my mind, the best Pizza place in Pittsburgh. I know that is a highly debatable topic, but when people from the North Shore bother to go to south hills to a little hole in the wall place with no parking and hardly any room to eat inside, you know it's good. \n\nI lived in Brookline for 2 years and would frequent this place. I would say that eating the pizza in the shop is better than taking it out. Even though it's a small place it's worth it to go to that lightly crispy crust something you don't get when it sit's in a box waiting for you to pick it up. \n\nAlso the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don't even bother putting toppings on your pizza. The topping is overshadowed by the sweet sause and the mountain of cheese so don't waist your money. It's better that way, trust me!"
"1","We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure, it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit. \n\nIt took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!\n\nWhen we tasted the pizza, it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side. \n\nWe will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on."
"1","Eat at Fioris, they said.  Youll like it, they said.\n\nis it conveniently located on West Liberty Boulevard, this restaurant features absolutely nowhere to park on the road that is impossible to get to.\n\nWhen I called to place our order a miserable sounding me an answer the phone with the side and then said what do you need? I placed our order and he said don't come down here it's going to be at least an hour to we can get to you if my coworkers can do anything right. That was really unprofessional. Some people may think that character but really I don't care what kind of a day the person taking the pizza order is having I just want to place my order without feeling im bothering them,\n\nYou should know that you will have to illegally parked your car to pick your order up.  the place was filthy inside and it was packed full of people and total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating in store even if the place was clean up you're still going to have people waiting to pick three orders of standing right over you. It was also about a hundred degrees in there. They also only take cash with they didn't mention and there was no sign so I was glad I had cash on hand.\n\nI knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy."
"1","I'm with Zachary on this one, after years of hearing about this pizza I finally tasted a slice at a steeler party. The sauce was normal, kinda sweet, garlicky, nothing special. Loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it. Knowing I don't eat meat my friends ordered me a half pizza with peppers and onions. It was still dripping with grease. I removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables. I was still kind of dumbfounded as to why this place gets raves. The crust was nothing to write home about, it was just kind of yeasty and chewy. I definitely don't see what all the fuss is. When I'm going to have a cheat day with pizza it's Beto's for me."
"2","Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles."
"2","Best pizza in the Burgh. No doubt."
"2","Their cheese pizza is a must have if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Period. It's where all the locals go and you should too!"
"2","There are some great pizza places in this City, and this is one of the best. Good balance of quality ingredients, and crust is consistently finished. The  small interior can get crowded at times, but the pizza is worth the minor inconvenience. Easily on par with Aiello's and Mineo's in Squirrel Hill, two of the more decorated pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Fiori's gets extra credit for using the small spicy pepperonis and always having a pinball game in the corner!"
"2","My husband's relatives love Fiori's, and I've grown to love it too. Apparently it was a neighborhood hangout for them when they were kids so they have a sentimental attachment to the place... I just like the pizza. The restaurant area is small, nothing fancy, and crowded on weekends, so we pick up and take our pie to the in-laws, who live close and usually don't cook for us when we visit.\n\nOur favorite seems to be the mushroom and pepperoni pie. I'm always a fan of a pliable crust with a thin layer of mildly sweet sauce and a THICK layer of cheese. I adore cheese. So based on my preferences, this pizza really does it for me. \n\nThe ultimate quest for the \""best pizza\"" is a tricky thing.  Everyone has different tastes and stipulations when it comes to their favorite pie, which makes me wonder: Is there really a \""best pizza\"" out there? There is most definitely BAD pizza, and you have only to look at most major chains to find it. Fiori's qualifies as a good pizza, and probably the best I've had from this area of town. So maybe that is all there is to it. Pizza can be good or bad, but no pizza is going to be perfect for everyone. And that's my pizza theory. \n\nYou're welcome folks."
"2","My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon. \n\nThere's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs. \n\nPreach."
"1","Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say \""I love fioris\"" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!!"
"2","The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!"
"1","Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich, they will not care about you or whatever is wrong with your car. Also, their warranties SUCK."
"1","We've been to a lot of car dealerships in the last few weeks, and this was hands-down, the worst experience of the bunch. We were first ignored, then made to sit and wait for pricing for more than 20 minutes, for no apparent reason. We will definitely not be going back."
"2","Great experience here with our most recent vehicle purchase! Kristen Ehmann welcomed us from the start. We have been looking for a new vehicle for several months, but hadn't made the purchase because of unclear pricing and the fact that most places didn't have what we asked for, but wanted to steer us into buying what they had...\n\nOur request was immediately answered by your team, and Kristen was friendly, helpful, and thoughtful. Of all our car buying experiences, she demonstrated the most skill and made the experience the most fun and least stressful.\n\nYour dealership worked with us from the start - even though it was late on Saturday, getting us the vehicle was not a problem. There was no \""come back on Monday or come back in a week\"" story from them - as soon as we agreed on the details, we were told that we would be driving our vehicle home that afternoon.\n\nKristen even followed up with us this week, and sent my 4 year old a \""Swagger Wagon\"" can cooler because she noticed that my daughter liked the promotional video. That's attention to detail.\n\nSue was great when we went on to make the deal - she was clear, concise, and was not pushy. There were no surprises, and we left pleased with the whole transaction.\n\nI am glad we checked out this dealership - would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a Toyota vehicle."
"2","This is up there in my top 5 thrift stores. While it doesn't have a lot in the way of furniture (a few pieces downstairs), it has plenty of everything else. My first visit was meant to be a short browse, but it turned into a marathon 2.5 hour shop. There were shelves and shelves of bric-a-brac to sort through, kitchen supplies galore, and so many clothes I couldn't even think about looking through them all. The only downsides were the out of control kids running around, and the constant traffic jams of shopping carts in the aisles. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place for the serious thrifter/new apartment dweller/anyone looking to kill a few hours."
"2","Ahhhhh. I cut my teeth on the RW&B in the mid nineties and just revisited it for the first time since then!! I always looked for thrift stores like this in LA and SF but....hell no. \n\nWow, has she gotten a makeover: ATM in the corner, a bathroom for patrons (one that is actually somewhat clean!) and the absence of that old person-Ben-Gay smell. Prices have gone up slightly....but where else can you buy a brand new tennis racket, framed photo of Kermit the Frog (signed!) and an oversized pair of Joan Collins a la Dynasty sunglasses....true story! And knowing that half your cart is filled with items the have color tags that are HALF OFF THAT day without knowing until checkout provokes sheer joy. I was a giddy schoolgirl the whole way home.\n\nFYI- it is still cash only and the parking lot can get a little wild. Watch out for the potholes!"
"1","Love the store. Nice stuff. Price reasonable. BAD parking...Employees at this location are nicer and willing to help compare to the one at Ohio River Blvd....Easy check out. Friendly staff....."
"1","As a general store that sells things for generally cheaper this is ok. Just ok. The perks are that is has its own parking lot, a large selection, and a big store space. Also pretty closely located most city neighborhoods. \n\nLets talk about a few \""thrift\"" store points 1. Price... the prices here are not low, for what you would normally identify with thrift, part of the thrill for me is finding things for next to nothing. So when I see Walmart and Target prices on almost everything that makes me immediately suspect. 2. \""Charity factor\"" I like shopping at places I know are helping others in some way. This store claims to offer opportunities for you to donate your goods so that they can buy them through \""Veterans of Vietnam\"" who then resell your donated goods for a profit (google it I did). So there's zero charity factor to this store, its a fairly large chain for profit, profiting off peoples donations. Ha Say that three times fast. \n\nmoving on an example of my problems with their pricing, everything in the kitchen section was 12.95$ really? Even for some plastic japan made unicorn trays, yup. I will pay that for a vintage item I really like but only on payday and only because I am a geek.  Clothing was not priced cheap and I could find nothing by size its all by color which is odd.  Its crowded and many items are broken yet seem to be priced at full I found a kiddie gate, for my dog only to find the bottom latch was broken. \n\nCool linens in the basement still at good prices... bonus for that I found some cool old curtains I want to use to recover my mid century chairs I just bought.\n\nTips:\n\n Cash only! The next time I see one of these signs I am going to look around me and ask the clerk if Christopher Lloyd has shown up with my Delorian yet so I can be transported back to the future. Where they use credit card machines instead of ATM machines from 1985.\n\nAntique factor: 4/5 they do have some old stuff\n\nPicked over factor 3/5 busy shop but they have a lot of stuff\n\nThrift factor 1/5 Over priced."
"1","It's a like a stampede when you enter this store! The least of the problem is the other shoppers, but the staff are gruff and unfriendly. Wasn't worth it for me."
"1","Parking sucks. It smelled. They are way way overpriced!  I saw a bag priced at $15 that was apparently donated from a yard sale because it had another tag for $3!  Just really lots of junk. Also it's a cash only place but they do have an atm. Their clothes are sorted by color which is cool."
"1","I've been to many thrift stores in my life and this one is definitely over priced! They are selling some items at a price that I could spend on the same item brand new! \n\nThe store closes at 6:00 which is very inconvenient for most people who work a 9-5. I had to rush to get there after work and still didn't get there until 5:45.\n\nIt is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude.\n\nI'd rather spend my money at Goodwill!"
"2","I am a big fan of It's Greek to Me in Brookline.  This tiny little place at the edge of Brookline doesn't look like much, but it has a real family character, cheap eats and tasty food.\n\nI have dined in twice and got carry out twice as well.  The first time I got a platter/dinner, but I found the deal is really to be had with the gyros.  Getting two gyros and a huge amount of fries for only $10 is a steal.  The gyro bread is toasted, but still soft and it is loaded with meat like your grandma would try to feed you.  The veggies have always tasted fresh and it is served hot.  If I could change on thing, I would prefer fresh herbs on the gyro instead of dried.  This gyro is definitely more spiced up than your chain restaurant gyro.  The fries are fresh cut and nothing is cooked until you order it.\n\nIf you choose to dine in, you will be greeted by the proprietor and casually asked to take a seat any where you like.  This isn't the type of place for formalities.  She will offer you some delicious Greek Tea (you have to try it) and take your order, cook it and then serve it to you.  Sometimes you can hear bickering in the kitchen between her and her old man- but that only adds to the family atmosphere.  The store does take credit card, so that's a great modern convenience.  At the end of the meal, we've always gotten a stick of gum :)\n\nIf you choose to carry out, it's a simple call and your food is ready by the time you drive down there.  There is usually a place to park near by and you can be on your way quickly."
"2","The food here is so good that I was ready to give It's Greek to Me a four-star review after eating takeout that had ridden halfway across Pittsburgh to meet up with me. It's a cliche to say dishes have layers of flavor, but there's no more accurate way to describe this thoughtful, absolutely delicious cooking.\n\nThe restaurant isn't fancy, but it's like eating in someone's living room, and those are some of the best restaurant meals I've had. The takeout gyro was great, with buttery pita and a potato-garlic spread that goes with frankly everything. But the souvlaki eaten in, while considering the scrapbook-worthy collection of paintings and memorabilia on the dining room walls, was sublime - a little char and a lot of flavor in every bite.  I have eaten a lot of Greek food cooked by a lot of Greek people who are very good cooks, and this stands up to any of it. Save room for the baklava, and don't share - you'll want your own piece."
"1","Very sad to find that donuts are made the day before.  I ordered three dozen donuts at about $10 a dozen, and found them to be stale and bordering on disgusting.  With all the awesome donuts in this town, why would you sell \""yesterday's donuts at today's prices?\""  Won't be returning there for any baked products as I have no idea when they may have been baked.  The woman that works at the counter is very sweet, I wanted to support this local business, sadly, I cannot."
"2","Very good!  The dinning room is located in the back behind the bar.  You must get the fried zucchini!  Their breading is so light yet flavorful!  The portions for the entr\u00e9es were HUGE!  Service was great, and everyone was very friendly."
"2","They make their own Pita breads here, and they make them delicious and cheap. This would be enough reason to go here, as it's hard to find tasty and fresh pitas (most of the time, the bags still have steam in them because they're so fresh) for a good price, and this is it.\n\nOn top of that, they have frozen raw gyros meat and home made tzatsiki sauce, so you can throw together a gyros sandwich. They have hummus and different kinds of olives by the pound, and a huge selection of turkish and arab foods. Some of their more interesting specialty items do get pricier, but mostly the cost is reasonable, and you can at least understand why a little box of food bought in sub-bulk from a random country in the Middle East is more expensive. \n\nDiverse, well stocked non-perishables and cheap, delicious pitas and prepared food accompaniments."
"2","Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.\n\nThey also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. \n\nI brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.\n\nThey also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good."
"2","We've always been fans of Pita Land as a great Mediterranean grocery and the best joint in Pittsburgh to get freshly made pitas of all varieties and hummus.  When we heard they were putting in a cafe, I knew it would be good.\n\nGyros, baked flat breads, pizzas, burgers, and all kinds of Mediterranean fare do not disappoint.  Much to our own demise (wayyy too much to eat), we ordered a meat flat bread (thinking it would be small), a Gyro Doner (larger than normal), and a Lamb Burger.\n\nThe Lamb Burger, hands down, is one of the best burgers I've actually had in Pittsburgh.  Super juicy.  Cooked to order.  Feta cheese, pickled onions, etc.  I highly recommend.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get a piece of baklava from the counter on your way out as well!"
"2","My favourite  restaurant and bakery in  pittsburgh"
"2","Pita Land, olive you.\n\nI don't know why I don't come here everyday.\n\nIt's a great little market, where you can get delicious Mediterranean/Lebanese/Middle Eastern groceries. They have fresh made hummus, dips, pita bread,  you name it! And everything's reasonably priced (don't have to shell out too many leaves for my grape leaves ...) \n\nBest of all, in the last year they opened a cafe inside. It's damn delicious and cheap to boot! The gyro, lamb burger, french fries with rosemary dip, flat breads are all excellent and won't disappoint!"
"2","New pita caf\u00e9 is a welcome addition to a classic bakery and some of the best hummus in Pittsburgh. A great menu with fresh and local items served quickly efficiently and kicked up condiments and extras at every turn. This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh bar none. Chef Greg keep it coming"
"2","Absofrigginamazeballs!  This place is the bomb!  Great food, friendly service and a little grocery in the side. Who could ask for more!?!  The falafel pita will astound. Yummers!"
"2","This place is amazing and anyone who isn't giving it 5 stars is crazy. My husband and I just moved to Brookline from NYC and when we discovered this place I felt like I struck gold. The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro, but next time will ask for a little more sauce. Pitaland is super clean, the employees are friendly and the food is the real deal. I plan on making it one of my regular stops."
"2","This time I brought my partner in culinary adventure and I ordered a Gyro and some fries.  My wife ordered a falafel plate.  She said it was the best she's ever had.  I felt the same about my Gyro.  The fries were great.  They're seasoned with something I couldn't identify and served with tartar.  Awesome.  I wish you could order a small because for $4 it's a huge basket.  Way too much for a side with a sandwich.  Miriam helped me out and I did finish them.  They were too good to waste.  I also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best I have ever had anywhere.  This place is a treasure.  If I lived near here, I would be here all the time."
"2","Love this bakery! It is my favorite in Brookline and always has delightful treats and wonderful staff. \n\nJust recently bought a King Cake for Fat Tuesday, and it was by far the best I've ever had and very affordable.\n\nStop by for snack!"
"1","If this place is affiliated with the bakery of the same name on Beverly Rd. in Mt. Lebanon, steer clear.  Bought 5 pastries today after I managed to drag the clerk away from her socializing and the one I tasted was so stale, I took a closer look at the others. They had all be dropped quickly in a too big box with no waxed paper in between them so they had fallen over.  The icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard.  I had my husband take a bite out of one and he confirmed it was bad.  We broke the others in half just to determine if any were fresh. Nope. Tossed them all and went to Prantl's."
"1","owner is a terrible terrible person. tossed me out for no good reason. i found the food very average overall"
"1","This is a perfect example of a really disgusting Pittsburgh style pizza, you guys love this awful crap for some reason.  \n\nI called in and asked how big their medium was, the idiot responded with \""8 cuts\"" which obviously tells me nothing considering you can cut anything into 8.  When I asked again he said 14 inches so I ordered a medium cheese and an order of breadsticks.  \n\nI will confess that I didn't actually try the pizza because I had to send it back because it was well past the point of being edible.  It was like pizza soup in a crust bowl. \n\nThis place is using deck style brick ovens, which is about the only thing they are doing right.  They do not cook directly on the brick though, they use pizza screens.  The screens that they use are the ones with the really big holes as opposed to the grid style screens that everyone else uses.  I have never seen another shop use the big hole screens, and probably for a reason because the dough was really really terrible cooked.  It was burned to the point of being black on the bottom at (which I usually don't mind at all) but somehow they managed for it to still be completely doughy and soft and not the least bit crispy.  Honestly it seems like some kind of miracle of science to have a black pizza bottom and for it to not at least be a little bit crispy.  The pizza was definitely on the overly thick and doughy side and even if it had been cooked well it probably still would have been too doughy to be very good.  The dough recipe may or may not have tasted good, no one will probably ever know because it will probably never be cooked evenly enough to even have a chance at tasting good. \n\nThe biggest problem with the pizza overall was the 2 pounds of cheese sunken into a large gelatinous wad in the middle.  It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut with something cheaper).  They are wasting so much money on cheese its sad.  Whoever the pizzaman was obviously took no pride in it whatsoever.  The sauce was all dropped into the middle with most of the cheese.  The edges of the pizza had big bubbles where all of the cheese and sauce should have been, but they were NOT the nice crispy kind of bubbles that could be enjoyed...just lumpy masses of sadness.  \n\nI can't comment on the taste of the sauce because I am not a brave enough man to have put a slice of this DIY toilet clogging kit into my delicate stomachular system.  Fake words aside, this pizza really sucks guys. \n\nThe icing on the cake were the breadsticks, a side item that I consider to be pretty un-f*ckable.  So for breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope that this is just some made-up Italian restaurant name and that someone doesn't actually put their family name behind this crap) just cuts up slices of the premade Sicilian dough and slaps some oil and herbs on it and calls it breadsticks.  Its the most ghetto attempt at this particular appetizer that I have ever heard of.  Its pretty funny, really. \n\n\nSo yeah, this place is definitely worth avoiding at all costs especially considering the prices aren't even good and the restaurant itself is completely filthy inside.  The owner was nice enough about refunding the money for the pizza.  Its a shame when I see businesses like this that are set in their ways and are really wasting their potential with a general lack of pride."
"1","\""Filthy\"" isn't a strong enough term. Try \""infested.\""  NEVER, EVER AGAIN. No matter how much I adore Bell's Sicilian pizza (which I typically order to carry out), the filth of the place is overwhelming. Took my mother into the dining room Friday evening. We were promptly seated (table nearest the kitchen and the wait station, constant employee traffic) and given beverages and menus via the hostess, who promised our waitress would take care of us soon. For the next 20 minutes, no employee acknowledged our existence, although we quickly placed our closed menus at the edge of the table to signal our readiness to order. As the minutes ticked away, I tried not to look at the foul carpeting, which appears to have been last cleaned approximately never. A cook emerged from the kitchen and quite literally shouted over our heads to a waitress at the far end of the nearly-filled dining room because he couldn't read her writing. (Have these people never eaten in a restaurant themselves??) Even still, we waited... until I absently flicked at one of the dozens of dark spots on the wall above our booth. It flew away. INSECTS ALL OVER THE WALL. If that's how the front is maintained, what must the kitchen look like??? We reopened the menu, found beverage prices and left money on the table. There was no indication that any of the waitresses or the hostess even noticed. DISGUSTING AND INEXCUSABLE. The place needs to be shut down and fumigated. Are they afraid they'd lose money if they closed long enough to CLEAN? Do they pay anyone to clean anything? I'll never go back."
"1","Can this place get an order correct the 1st time? I think not!"
"2","You could have thought I was a child with a brand new toy last night when Darren, Mom and I stopped here for a quick bite. This is one of those revamped locations. Large flat screen TV, electric fireplace, and lounging chairs! But my greatest excitement came from the soda fountain. It is a touch screen operated dispenser. Push the button for what you want (I got diet coke), and you are given the choice of your soda alone or with one of six flavor additives. Lime, grape, orange, cherry, lemon, and raspberry! I wanted to play with each flavor, but didn't. The food quality itself honestly isn't bad for fast food. Wendy's really has improved! The burger wasn't as greasy as usual and the fries are crunchy and full of flavor! I love the sea salt! They also has a small bakery selection. Darren and I shared an Oreo brownie. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumy!"
"1","Pretty interior, spiffy soda fountain,  Worst. Service. Ever. \n\n I've had multiple problems with the crew in this store since they re-opened, but yesterday evening took the cake.  I went in to pick up some last minute food for the family and was immediately suspicious when I saw half a dozen people milling about unhappily at the food pickup location, an no one giving them food.  When I questioned the cashier about the delay, another customer actually came back and demanded a refund because she couldn't wait any longer.  When I noticed that half of the crew seemed to be sitting in the dining room watching TV. \n  \n I've been to this store frequently and there is definitely a pattern or very very poor and incompetent service. Almost every order I've placed had something forgotten or incorrect. There are always crewmembers milling around doing nothing, playing with the TV or in case, rapping behind the counter.\n\n I've just had it with this store, I plan on avoiding it until the get some people actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same.  At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen.\n\nUPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed.  In the last month, I have been there 2 or 3 times with simple take-out orders and everything seemed to go fine. Got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time and everyone on the crew were if not working, not blatantly goofing off. So added a Star to the rating, even though I'm still kind of leary."
"1","Worst McDonalds!!! they took 45 min for one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!"
"1","Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink), I'd call the corporate office and tell them to fire the whole place and start over."
"1","This isn't the worst McDonalds in town, at least they eventually get your order correct. But the situation inside is fairly ridiculous.  The crew during the day seems to be over a dozen employees, but they only ever have one person taking orders, and you have to wait on that person to wander back to their post to actual sell you some food.  You can see half a dozen employees in the back apparently working on cooking food, but all those people still can't get your food out in less than 10 minutes. But while you are waiting you can watching another half dozen employees at the take-out window chatting the day away while one person occasionally fills up a bag and gets an order out."
"2","Chose this place based on the previous review. I live in the Banksville area and have been searching for a decent place for Chinese takeout for years. Particularly, my wife and I have been searching for a restaurant with ample, fresh veggies (with rice and brown sauce or with lo mein) and crisp, tasty tofu. I called Tong's for the first time without referencing a menu and simply described what I was looking for over the phone. They said, \""Yep, we can do that\"" and then told me it'd be ready in 20 minutes.\n\nI got there and it's as unpretentious as the reviews say. A regular walked in behind me and asked where the kid was and apparently he was in vacation in China. While waiting for my food (I was early), I perused the menu and noticed that what I had ordered (mixed veggies w/ brown sauce and an order of General Tso's tofu) didn't exist on the menu. I was charged a reasonable amount in spite of this and it turned out pretty good. Not my favorite tofu to date (Mandarin Gourmet downtown wins that) but definitely satisfied my craving. Vegetables were also very, very good. They included zucchini, carrots, broccoli, onions and other good stuff without the typical \""filler\"" veggies that you find at cheaper places. With that being said, this place was a buck or two cheaper than everywhere else I've tried in a 10 mile radius. \n\nBottom-line: Best Chinese restaurant this side of the tunnels. Highly recommend."
"2","yummy, yummy chinese food.  thank heavens for there being one in brookline.  great food.  friendly, fast service.  decent prices.  funny kid who jumps out and tries to scare me every time i go is great in store entertainment.  very simple decore.\n\ni always walk here when i order since it so close and they always have it ready before i get there.  usually get the general tso's.  must try the other menu items someday."
"1","Had the chicken kabob and hummus. Didnt enjoy either, hence, the two stars. On the other hand, the bartender was really nice. Might give a second try."
"2","Lunch was outstanding! Double down with hummus and tabulee.\nWill be back for dinner soon!!"
"1","Worst service ever!!! We were a party of 10 had a reservation and you think they care about your reservation? Heck no!!! Waited for our table for an hour!!!! No body came check on us, we have been waiting by an empty table, no apologies, and when we ask about the table, they were really mean and rude, the hostess was not doing her job and they ended up kicking us out because they were upset how impatient we were, no.... I think anyone would be upset waiting for reservation for that long. Worst experience ever!!! Will defiantly not go there again!!"
"1","I'll second the other reviewer that said for the price charged, the amount of food you receive doesn't measure up. Furthermore, Pittsburgh still has yet to have any quality schawarma. \n\nI ordered both the beef and chicken schawarma to sample. \n\nThe beef:\n\n- clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' as opposed to freshly shaved off a doner.\n- a measly 2 slices at that, I basically had a wrap of lettuce and tomato w/ a hint of beef\n\nThe chicken:\n\n- clearly a once frozen and somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast again as opposed to being freshly sliced off a doner and a mix of white and dark meat. this leaves the meat dry and tasteless. \n- maybe a half of a chicken breast if I was lucky\n\nNo toum or similar sauce served at all with either dish?!?! That's hitting a whole new low for fake schawarma. \n\nHostess was great, service was adequate. I have no motivation to return. \n\nHopefully one day Pittsburgh will have good choices when it comes to Greek and Med. food. Today is not that day."
"2","Wonderful surprise in the South Hills desert of chain eateries. Romantic interior that's a refreshing throwback, and the best hummus and iced tea I had in Pittsburgh. The kebabs are sizzling, generous, and delicious, and the staff friendly."
"1","As I stated before , I don't review chain restaurants unless something is outstanding or horrible . Well , this place is beyond horrible . If I could give negative  stars I would . The food was typical McDonalds . Not good or bad . The service , however , was terrible . As I placed my order , the greeting I got was \"" what do you want \"" . The woman who waited on my obviously didn't finish the sixth grade and didn't care about manners . She was slow as molasses even though there were several people in line behind me . After taking time out to BS to a coworker about her weekend , she gave me my order and never said \"" thankyou\"" . I replied \"" your welcome \"" very loudly to make a point but got a mean stare in return . I asked to speak to manager but was told he was busy for next 15 minutes or so . I left and as I was driving away , I saw the manager and two other workers grabbing a smoke near the rear door . No wonder the service was horrible !!! Will never stop here again ."
"1","I go to fast food places a few times a year, at best, so maybe my expectations are a little skewed, but my latest experience at McDonald's left a lot to be desired. There's really no use in rating the actual food, as it's hard to screw up food at a McDonald's. It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving.\n\nMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order.\n\nAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \""are his McBites up yet?...where are they?\"" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \""going to pee\""  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer.\n\nI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible."
"1","Horrible, rude service.  12 minute wait for fast food?!?!"
"2","Sesame Inn was the place we went when we wanted Chinese food when I was growing up in Pittsburgh. My family owned a Chinese restaurant themselves and when they wanted Chinese food this is where we went. I remember the walnut chicken and the orange beef the most. What I would give to have some. The dumplings were also a favorite of mine too!! Just another place I will be sure to visit when I travel back to the Burgh."
"2","Nice atmosphere, good food - Sesame Inn gets an A in my book.  The service is good - I especially like the man who has been refilling water glasses since I was in middle school and always smiles at you.  There is a room off the main dining room to support larger groups, a full bar, and a great menu.  The lunch specials are very affordable, even to high school students, and can be packed on days when school lets out early.\n\nAs far as the food goes, everything is delicious.  The hot and sour soup is great, the ma po bean curd is the best I've ever had, and even their newest offering of pad thai is pretty good.  Whether you're taking out, eating in, or having food delivered, everything here is delicious."
"2","My grandmother lives in Washington, PA. Several times a year, I go to visit her and we make the trek to Sesame Inn. I absolutely love their lettuce wraps, Pad Thai, and/or Singapore Noodles. We normally share the wraps and an order of the Pad Thai. It is a huge portion. Even while sharing, we still take left overs home! Great!!!!"
"2","My wife and I and our son love this restaurant. Once you have Chinese food here you will select this as your top Chinese restaurant. Everyone is so friendly, the service is excellent and the food always comes nice and hot. They also have some excellent Thai specialties. I recommend the KieWan if you like Thai dishes. The amazing chicken will keep you coming back time and time again.  I cannot recommend this place enough; try it and I bet you agree."
"1","If you're seeking bland, salty, Chinese food where every entree tastes exactly the same as the other...this is your place!"
"1","This is my first yelp review. I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. \n\nI first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However,  every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation, chicken was fried ahead of time,and fried again when you order, That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal.\n\nWell, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. \n\nFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. \n\nBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund.\n\nI have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever. It was so bad, I would not dear to try again. \n\nI do hope the owner sees this, and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further, and willing to be convinced to come back.\n\nSincerely"
"2","Absolutely amazing I usually don't venture out and we went to a new restaurant and I got a new dish, Capitol chicken it was truly amazing, wait staff is always there when you need them. would definitely go back!"
"1","The oil to sauce ratio for my Kung pao chicken was 1:1 - maybe worse.  I couldn't eat it.  I literally had to rinse it off under hot water in order to salvage a few bites.  This isn't the first time that I have had this problem here.  Takeout is gross.  I won't be back."
"2","My buddy wrote to me and said I should do a review of Mark Pi's China Gate. To be completely honest, I thought I had. I checked and saw that indeed, I had not. It's been a good six months since my last visit, I remember what I ordered and how good the entire experience was.\n\nI ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and an order of bok choy which was steamed first, then quickly stir fried, delicious. The eggplant was tender, a touch of heat from chilis, garlicky, meaty and filling, served with brown rice, very nutritious. My family all ordered something different, Judy, my cousin who thinks China Gate is the finest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and would come here at the drop of a hat, ordered her Chicken and Green Beans. I must admit, when I did eat meat, I've had this on many occasions and it's really very good. The green beans are crisp tender, the chicken is finely ground,  moist, and tender.\n\nOver all Mark Pi's China Gate is good Chinese food, served in a nice atmosphere, and a great value for your hard earned buck."
"1","NEVER EVER get the All-you-can-Eat. Hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isn't even grilled. They give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi. It's like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly. Also, service was unfriendly."
"1","My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later, ALL of our food was brought out.  I was shocked.  There was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast.  My son took one bite, I didn't even bother, and we called the waiter back over.  I told her I expected fresh food, not some hidden buffet that had been sitting out.  I got up to leave and she called the manager who tried to force me to pay.  I refused.  I will never go back.  There is such a thing as food too fast.  If I wanted fast food I'd have gone to Mickey D's."
"1","Horrible experience!!! I wouldn't suggest this salon to my worst enemy!! \n\nSpent close to 4 hours there for highlights and a haircut!!! May of taken so long because, I was given two hair treatments... That I NEVER asked for!!!! My highlights were not even blonde.. as I asked for!!! \n\nGrossly overpriced.. Beware for the treatments given without consent!! You will be charged for them despite never asking for them!! When you call to speak to manager/owner about your $250. Negative experience... He will never return your call!!"
"2","I don't understand the negative reviews of this place!!  I no longer live in Pittsburgh but I loved Alberta Modern. I went to Natasha, who is so awesome. She always listened to what I wanted and I was always thrilled with what she did. Not to mention she's great to talk to and the first time I went there, we instantly bonded. As a blonde, my color can be tricky to get exactly right. I've since moved to Chicago and have not been able to find anyone I like as much and I pay three times more to get my hair done. I miss you Natasha!!!"
"2","I bought a guitar online, but it needed to be set up (altered)--in particular, the action on it was too high. I brought it into Empire Music, which was my local neighborhood music store at the time. The guy who helped me--I wish I could recall his name--was nice and very helpful to me. But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument.\n\nI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon.\n\nMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers.\n\nSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community."
"1","One star for the unpleasant experience I have had at this store. I was treated very poorly by a particular gentleman with an unjustified ego who was working the counter. He dismissed my honest inquiry in a very rude and unprofessional manner. It seems as though he would only care to cater to the experienced musicians who enter his shop. It's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect. Because of him, I do not care to return to see if any other staff members are any more helpful. I will not be returning here for ANY musical needs."
"2","excellent service.  really good with the kids.  the owner Joe always provides excellent service"
"2","Great service, quality work, good prices.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, I know... it's independently owned.  Love it!"
"2","This trendy little place has great pizza.  Pizza that makes you feel like you might be eating healthy because this is not a heavy pizza.  I love the slight spiciness of the sauce and the thinness of the crust.  It can be a little on the pricey side but it is worth it.  Expect lines on Friday and Saturday.  Check out the patio in the summer time.\n\n\nI used to live in Lebo and miss this place since moving to Charlotte, NC over four years ago.  I stop at Il Pizzaiolo every time I am back in town.  Charlotte really needs a place like this and the closest attempt is Brixx Pizza.  Been there a few times and the ingredients are not up to par with Il Pizzaiolo."
"2","Amazing pizza. The crust is as it should be--chewy in parts, crunchy in others. The Margherita D.O.C. is always a good choice, but if you really want to travel to yum-yum land, get the Panna. With mushrooms, ham, mozzerella and a drizzle of heavy cream, it brings together flavors that seem made for each other."
"2","Il Pizzaiolo serves authentic and delicious pizza and pasta.  I highly, highly recommend eating in the \""wine bar\"" out back - where the main restaurant is loud, bright, and crowded, the wine room is darker, more romantic, and closer to the bar."
"2","Probably one of the best places to eat pasta or wood-fired pizza..."
"1","We were so excited to try Il Pizzaiolo after hearing about it from so many people and reviews online.  We discovered after arriving that they will accept cash only until further notice.  Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago, but assumed it was a one-night thing.  In the era of credit and debit cards being accepted everywhere (even McDonalds and 7-11) it seems inexcusable for a decent restaurant to make patrons withdraw money from an ATM before dining there.  I'm sure we will still try Il Pizzaiolo, but at the moment I'm extremely annoyed with them!  We made the sacrifce and went to Bistro 19 next door."
"2","The pizza at Il Pizzaiolo was fantastic.  We ordered 3 pizzas: the Margherita, the Bianca, and the fennel sausage and rapini pizza (I forget the menu name).  My favorite was the Bianca - the ricotta cheese pushed it over the top.  The ambiance was very nice as well.  We sat in the outdoor seating in the back, which had a perfect combination of sun and shade.  The reason I gave a 4 star rating was for the somewhat slow and inattentive service.  I can't say that the service is typically like this, but we had a waitress in-service who was still learning and IMO, a bit overwhelmed.  But otherwise, I would highly recommend Il Pizzaiolo."
"2","Finally - a Pittsburgh restaurant with a decent outside patio!  Patio is in the back, so you don't get all the road noise, and is quite pleasant.  In fact, we got seated in the back corner by the fountain, which is not a normal table, but one of those stone garden tables.  Despite not being the most comfortable of seats, it was by far the most enchanting part of the patio.\n\nI thought the pizza was \""eh.\"" The dough was a little \""doughy' for my taste.  I was significantly more impressed with my pasta dish, which was incredibly delicious, but also incredibly rich, so I had to leave about half of it.  I guess that's what I get for ordering pastas with cream sauce.\n\nIn summary - a cute place for a date if you can sit outside.  I didn't find the inside half as exciting.  I'll give them another chance on the pizza, but even if you don't have that, try the pasta."
"1","After eating at Bistro 19 I was very excited when I saw that Il Pizzaiolo was right next door.  I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said, I went to Il Pizzaiolo last night with my fiance, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  We started with the Caesar salad, which was OK.  The dressing was delicious, however there was very little of it, and we found ourselves eating entire bites of dry, flavorless lettuce.  It was also an outrageous $10 dollars.  Don't get me wrong, had this been an entree sized portion, $10 would have been more than appropriate.  However it was just a starter size, and should have been no more than $6.\n\nWe then shared their margherita pizza which had delicious flavors, but was incredibly soggy.  It was also fairly small, but that was almost to be expected.  It was $12 dollars, so the size was not necessarily a problem, however it was hard to enjoy such a soggy mess of a pizza.  We also shared a pasta dish which was INCREDIBLY overpriced.  At $17 dollars, I was expecting more than a small bowl filled with dry pasta.  It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.  We finished with tiramisu which was excellent, and appropriately priced at $8.\n\nIn all, I found the flavors of their food to be excellent, however i was horribly misled.  Not only was every menu I found online roughly $2 to $3 dollars cheaper than their actual menu, but there was a table next to us who ordered pasta and received an enormous portion, prompting us to order pasta.  It was only till later did we realize that they were employees who had decided to dine their for the evening.  We also had a serious problem with the timing of the food.  The service was great, however for a Tuesday night, I would have thought their kitchen could time the courses properly; we had barely started our salad when the entree's came.  In all, I don't think I will be going back to this restaurant, nor would I recommend anyone waste their time traveling out to Mt. Lebanon for average Italian."
"1","Dinner& Movie: After the downpour, the thunder clapped, the lightening flashed, the skies parted and \""date night!\"" arrived.  My date and I were told there was a 30-40 minute wait and after almost leaving, we made our way through the restaurant to wait in the wine bar.  Hmm a bit misleading.  It was quite humid and crowded.  I am patient and was in great company but...there were some negative moments.  On our way up the wine bar stairs,  I held the door as a hostess directed a party down the teeny stairs to their table, only to be squished by patrons coming up who thought I was there for their convenience and more than happy to hold the door as they pushed past.  Also some of  the patrons at the bar seemed displeased that new faces were coming in and did not seem to want to budge to make any room for ordering beverages.  Anyway, I do not drink so I had literally stand still (think sardines) until some people were seated elsewhere.  I was then able to find comfy chairs to sit in.  There were some appetizers sweating and/or floating in olive oil on the windowsill which I found a little gross.  A not-so-polite employee cleaned up the space and extra drink glasses around me.  Giving me a dissatified \""thanks a lot\"" look that made me want to justify myself as not being the slob that left the glasses and plates!  But my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted.  We were seated surprisingly promptly.  We were lead to a small two top near the door.  While not ideal, it was do-able.  I had a salad and the pizza with te arugula while my date hads the fpur cheese.  I loved my pizza and besides one of the cheeses my date also enjoyed his pie.  The pizza crust was slightly sweet and baked just right. (Like I said, I really enjoyed mine and the food is why I gave 3 not 2 stars.)  Thankfully my date was able to help me finish my pizza and there was some to take home.  Our waiter was nice and somewhat attentive.  I did have to hunt him down for red pepper flakes, a refill on water and our small table became quite crowed and yet he did not remove the bread basket/plates.  I grew up in Mt. Lebanon and know that sometimes the neighborhood can be a bit \""snooty-pooty\"" but I would go back.  But not on a Friday night and honestly it would not be in my first choice out of the other nearby restaurants."
"2","My wife and I like this place. It's always crowded, but you can wait in the wine bar--if that's not also packed to the brim(which it usually is). The pizza is the best in the area--exquisite crust, nice ingredients. Pricey, though. And parking is a pain. Luckily, Mt Lebo parking tickets are like $7.00, which is what you'd pay at a downtown garage anyway."
"2","I almost don't want to give the secret away.  \nBest italian food I have had since going to Italy.  Simple, yet addicting. The wine bar is hidden in the back area and it is such a nice place to visit during the week.  Don't even try to go there on the weekends... too crowded.\nIn the summer, sitting outside is such a luxury.  Order the Rigatoni alla Siciliana.  Perfecto!"
"2","My local go-to for a great meal with friends. Always delish, fresh and well made meals, great wine, warm atmosphere. I'm lucky to have Il Pizzi a block away."
"1","Growing up in Mt. Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\n\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \""we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\"" She points to a small table for 4 and says \""You'll sit there.\"" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \n\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\n\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\n\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.\n\nAs for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food. \n\nThere are so many options in downtown Mt. Lebanon that there's no reason to put up with bad service, attitude, and mediocre, overpriced food. I won't be coming here again."
"2","My very first review, be gentle, here goes:\n\nConfession, I joined Yelp one time specifically because of this place!  Their Margherita pizza and Penne Alla Vodka are listed as my last meal for a reason!  Whenever I come here, I don't eat the whole day so I can enjoy my carb fest!\n\nAs reviewers have stated previously, the service is hit or miss at this establishment.  I have had days where the host/hostess has seated my party promptly and had the most efficient waitress/waiter during my stay.  Then there have been times where I've felt like a nuisance for my presence.  That said, the food is so divine that I really don't care, it's worth the chance!  As Kat M. stated in a previous review, the ingredients are all authentic and high quality and it is a stand out amongst many restaurants in the area.  The crust is chewy, with that  Neapolitan type char to the bread.  The Mozzarella is creamy and floats on top of the sauce in a gooey little pockets. The sauce, goodness the sauce, it's bright and delectably simple.  In fact, it makes my mouth water to think of it.  Their pasta choices are always on par as well.  I order the Penne Alla Vodka, no fail, every time.  I actually had to learn how to make my own because I had to cut corners on my budget at one time!   They always have nice drink selections, but I love that they serve the small Coca-Cola bottles with a glass of ice, it gives the experience that European touch!  It's affordable and delicious, definitely a no-brainer for a great, casual night out with friends.  I no longer live in the area and I still crave a weekend in the Pittsburgh area just so I can get a pie!  My friend from L.A. consistently gushes about her pizza and pasta that she had whilst she visited me almost four years ago!  \""Oh, what I wouldn't do for some Il Pizzaiolo!\""  I couldn't agree more.\n\nIt makes me want to check Kayak for some cheap tickets to PIT!"
"1","The appetizer was bruschetta.  Essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings.  Two of the three were good, but the brocolinni topped one was not my taste.  Certainly, this was NOT worth the $12 price.  Our dinner was pizza.  The crust was very good - almost like a soft, warm, flat breadstick.  Sadly, the pizza was sparsely topped with cheese and sausage.\n\nOur server was attentive, almost to a fault.  The restaurant was excessively loud - we couldn't hear the waitress rattle off the soup, appetizer or entree specials (seven specials in total).\n\nWhile the food was not bad, I can't justify the prices or quantities.  In fact, I really didn't pull up Yelp to rate this restaurant...I'm actually looking for a place to go eat since I'm still famished after \""eating\"" here."
"2","\""I can only speak for the pizza, but have it on good authority that the same attention to quality, fresh ingredients is extended to the entire menu. I'll be back to sample more of everything, and to order the Margherita DOC again, and again..and again. If you're anywhere remotely close to the area, I would highly recommend a visit. If you're a pizza fanatic - it's worth making a much lengthier trek.\""\n\nfull review with pictures on my site"
"2","Passing through town, tried this place bc of Yelpers. Was not disappointed, the pappardelle with sausage was awesome, pizza great, and don't forget the tiramisu!"
"2","Have I found my new favorite date spot? My fianc\u00e9e and I just enjoyed dinner here last night and we were thrilled with every part of our experience at Il Pizzaiolo. We showed up pretty late, around 9:20pm and were provided with quick service from a friendly server. \n\nI was pleased with their wine list- lots of great Italian reds. The Barbera d' Asti they have by the glass is excellent! We ordered the Carcuccieri pizza (or had a similar name- the one with artichokes and prosciutto) and loved every bite. Real wood-oven cooked thin crust pizza, with good quality toppings and San Marzano tomato sauce. Molto bene!\n\nWe parked on the street and were able to find a spot easily. Seemed like a pretty and safe neighborhood. When the weather is decent, dine outside on their back patio. It's gorgeous and romantic!"
"1","Way overpriced for just ok food.  On a Tuesday night, there was a long wait.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, and when we had to wait, they simply pointed towards the wine bar.  Having never been there before, I was confused by having to pass through the outside to get to the bar.  While I thought the wine bar was cozy, the other customers there were rude and self-centered, ignoring polite \""excuse me\"" by the waitstaff.   When we were finally seated, we waited about 10 minutes before a server appeared.  The food was prompt, and the salad was more than enough to share.  The pizza was simply ok.  I've had much better wood-fired pizza elsewhere.\n\nBeware:  for just a party of five, they added a 20% tip onto the bill.  If you're going to add a tip to a bill, make it the customary 18%.  But frankly, I didn't think they needed to add the tip for us.  Also, do not use multiple credit cards.  I was charged for the entire bill on my card, even though we asked to split it between two.  I'm still waiting for my overpayment to be refunded by the restaurant..."
"2","While in Pittsburgh with the hubby for a quick weekend getaway, I took Misty B.'s (@chi_mist) recommendation and tried this place out. \nCasual, but trendy, restaurant that was the perfect little date night. \nThe wine menu was good - and the server helped us pick out a few based on our tastes. \nThe food was VERY good. We had the Polpettini (mini meatballs) as an appetizer and they were all gone in about 5mins. \nWe shared two entrees: the DOC margherita pizza and a pasta special of the evening - penne with a lamb ragu. \nThe pizza... the pizza... the pizza.... I could eat the entire thing by myself. I forgot about the pasta, and to be honest, it couldn't stand up to the pizza.\n\nThis 5 star rating is absolutely for the best margherita pizza I've ever had - and thanks Misty for the awesome rec!"
"2","Although there are plenty of new brick oven pizza places popping up in the burgh almost monthly, this is still the best.  Robertos is the only other brick oven that compared.  Now that Roberto is in the Village, NYC this is certainly the tastiest spot left."
"2","Now, this isn't the best pizza I have ever had, but it is the most authentic and that is why it is getting 5-stars.  I was craving and in search of a place where I could get the most authentic DOC style Italian pizza, and I honestly think that this place is the best I have ever had at making a certified Margarita pizza.  I cannot wait to go back: luckily, my grandma lives across the street!!"
"2","Great little place in downtown Mt Lebanon. My mother and aunt live in Mt. Lebanon and my husband and I visit a couple times a year, and on a night we had to ourselves decided to have a late dinner here.As it was a Saturday, the place was packed and had a couple groups waiting. Because we were only needing a table for 2 we were able to get seated promptly. \nThis was one of the evenings when the daytime temperature was over 100 degrees and was still very hot after sundown; the restaurant was boiling hot. They have a wood burning pizza oven so I am sure that they cannot keep the place as cool as some eateries (most are too cold for me). Service was very fast and very attentive, and very nice. We had cold water on our table in under 30 seconds of seating, were given just the right amount of time to look at the menu, and received our appetizer within 10 minutes of seating. Our food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering, with enough time to not be rushed through our appetizer. \nI cannot remember what our appetizer's name was, but it was a dough pocket filled with mozzarella and had yellow and red tomatoes to the side. It was well done, but I felt like it was simply too huge a portion to really be an appetizer/salad. Giant mound of mozzarella + only 4 thin slices of tomatoes seemed off somehow; still tasted great though.\nMy husband had Linguini alle Vongole- clams in a white sauce. He absolutely loved the meal, and the dish arrived with more clams than I would ever have expected. \nI ordered Chicken Piccata, as I was wanting something lighter than pasta or anything packed with cheese. The lemon was so refreshing and the sauce done very nicely- not too buttery, with more of the lemon and wine coming through- definitely nice after such a seething hot day.\nThe quality of the food shines through, even from the menu. I appreciate a place that used San Marzano tomatoes, real buffalo mozzarella, huge sprigs of basil, , etc. The prices were a little steep but I didn't leave the place lamenting over the cost.\nThe last comment I will leave is that the place is ungodly loud when full. Now, I am not a local, and I have always noticed that in general Pittsburgh restaurants are much louder than what I am used to (San Fransisco CA, Louisville KY, Washington DC, Baltimore MD and Philly). I usually chalk it up to a Pittsburgh thing, but this place was wayyyy louder for whatever reason. There was one group of maybe 10 (noise wasn't so much from them anyway) people but otherwise all small groups. I say this merely b/c a couple people have said it's a great date spot. I would agree, but NOT FOR A FIRST or any getting-to-know-you dates- you won't hear half of what your date said and who wants to have to scream so everyone around you knows it's a first date? :) \nOverall, a great restaurant and I cannot wait to come back try their DOC pizza- it looked superb."
"2","Delicious, up scale pizza. Not a good place for young kids. Lovely patio."
"1","I have always held this place in high regard, super cute and has always been delicious but when my bf and I and a couple friends went a couple weeks ago I was extremely disappointed. I'm vegan and so is my bf so we were already limited in choices, the Napoli antipasto is awesome but our entree left much to be desired. I forget the exact name but it was basically a spaghetti w pomodoro sauce. I can't believe they charge $16 for this dish! It was cold and not a good portion. I got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip. I love spicy stuff too! Just not a good value for the $. I just moved back from nyc and my fav place there charges significantly less for significantly more. I'm so disappointed bc this was one of my go to places in Pgh! :/"
"1","Il piz, is a Mt lebo staple, but not that great.  We ordered the bucatini americano and a pizza.  The bucatini was good, but not a great value.  I was excited about the pizza because they cook it in a brick oven, which should make a great pie, but was disappointed when it came out soggy.  Should have been nice and crisp.  There weren't even many toppings to make it soggy.  probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices."
"2","I'm well overdue for an update of this place, as it slowly became one of my regular spots in Pittsburgh since the review of my first visit.\n\nHere's what you need to know: This is the most authentic pizza in Pittsburgh. Hands down. There are NO other contenders. In fact, this is the ONLY place in Pennsylvania that is VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana)-certified to make a true DOC pizza, so it's not really a debatable point.\n\nIf you don't like authentic pizza, fine (but I think you're insane). For me, having the most authentic pizza also means they make the best pizza. DOC margherita pizza is one of my favorite foods in the world, and I ate it at least once a week when I was living in Florence. Il Pizzaiolo is very, very, very close to the real thing in Italy. If you call yourself a pizza snob, you need to get here, order a DOC margherita with mozzarella di bufala, and maybe a rucola e proscuitto while you're at it. You can thank me later.\n\nThe pasta is also excellent, but not as good as Dish in the South Side so I only order it if I'm with a group. Pizza, though. Mmmmm..."
"1","Ok...so, it's difficult to give this a star rating as I had a mixed experience. The caesar salad is one of the BEST I have ever had, but the pizza is one, if not the worst I have ever had. I ordered the margarita, sauce, cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar."
"2","The wine bar in the back is one of my favorite drink spots of all time. We just visited in January, and the fireplace was going. Perfect and cozy! Good place for a conversation, but very tiny. Good for a date or catching up with a friend. It's an older and mature crowd, but because of the way it's kind of tucked away, you'll seem like you really know something if you bring a date here.\n\nThere are a good number of wines by the glass, and some good cocktails. Try the Bufala Negra (bourbon, balsamic vinegar, ginger ale, and some other ingredients I can't remember). \n\nDrinks aren't cheap, but these drinks are for sipping anyway. The bartender was sweet, too."
"2","I have been to Il Piz several times overthe past few years and I have yet to be impressed. Don't get me wrong, the food has always been good, but not fantastic and a little over priced. Yes, I've had the pizza. Yes, I've had several pasta dishes. None of which has changed my mind. I don't understand why there is always such a long wait for a table here. \nMy latest trip was on a warm Saturday night. I met a few friends on the patio for dinner. I arrived a llittle late and with baby in tow. I specifically asked for them to order me a glass of wine so it was on the table when I arrived. Unfortunately, for my dining companion, I miscalculated the size of baby + diaper bag and knocked over the glass of wine spilling it all over his yellow shirt. It almost looked like a tie dyed effect. The wait staff rushed to our side bringing him a glass of seltzer water and me a new glass of wine (I later found out at no charge). Seltzer water had nothing on the masterpeice I created. The shirt was officially retired. Once we got settled, I ordered the insalata misticanza. Despite the fancy name, it's a rather typical salad with balsamic, greens and some typical veggies. Nothing extravagant here, especially for 11$. For my entree, I had the fusilli ala ragu di bracioli. The pasta was cooked well. The beef was a little dry. The sauce was ok. I decided to not take home my left overs. Overall, my bill ended up being 40$. For a salad, pasta dish and 1 glass of wine. This same meal would average at least 5 dollars less at an equivalent restaurant. The best thing about the meal was the service. The server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. Overall, I will most likely go back to Il Piz because it is such a staple in the South Hills area, though it would not be by my choice."
"2","Best pizza I've eaten in Pennsylvania, the Margareta with imported tomatoes and sauce is, in itself, amazing. Everything on the menu is memorable.\n\nThis place is, however crowded and can be quite noisy and they don't take reservations.\n\nSomewhat food-allergy friendly, but no gluten-free pasta, and they could improve a bit on this."
"2","I can only add to the already good reviews on Yelp. The outside area was very pleasant. The food was simply very good traditional italian. Highly recommended."
"2","I visited Italy recently and when I came back I decided I wanted to try to find some similar quality Italian food here in Pittsburgh now that my standards are higher after having the real deal.  Pizzaiolo did not disappoint.  They had a pasta with an all'Amatriciana sauce I had only seen before in Italy, and I also had their lasagne bolgnese and a fresh buffalo mozzarella appetizer.  All were amazing and on par with the quality I found in Italy.  They also had a nice selection of Italian craft beers which I've never seen anywhere else in the US before.  I just wish they'd include some English descriptions of them on the menu!  All the staff there is also very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere feels more like a gourmet brick oven pizza place than a nice Italian restaurant, but they definitely have a lot more to offer than their pizza (which is also excellent)."
"2","Love the margherita DOC, love the dessert. Brick oven pizza is a favorite of mine. I like to try many different places & this is a favorite of mine!"
"1","I have tried II Pizzaiolo twice now and I am not a fan. The food was very good but over priced and the atmosphere is stuffy and very loud. If you are looking for a relaxing night out, this is not the place to go."
"1","I actually really enjoy the wine bar behind the actual restaurant. Since it is considered a wine bar in that particular portion of the restaurant, I would except more wine by the glass, no matter the price. I would pay $$$$ for wine by the glass, so I know I like it and then would pay $145 for a bottle.\n\nThen there's the main restaurant that I really wasn't that impressed with. We were sat at the table with the most slant...which there were other open tables for two with No slant. Our glasses were sliding down the table so we used our silverware to stop them from sliding. No joke! The food I ordered was penne alla vodka, which was pretty tasty. But for $18, and that's all you get?! I've had better. The bread wasn't impressive, just sliced up sour dough bread with not so high end olive oil. (You can taste the difference between a really good olive oil and a bulk cheap kind). \n\nHaving said that, I will certainly return to the wine bar for maybe a glass of wine and try maybe the pizza, but not the main restaurant."
"1","I always used to make sure to have dinner here during my yearly visits to Pittsburgh.\nThis will be the last time as the food was mediocre and the restaurant  looked like it was neglected. There are many new and better restaurants to choose from.\nThe sad state this once cutting edge restaurant devolved into is a real shame as it used to be one of Pittsburgh's best."
"2","Favorite Italian in pittsburgh.  Good service, wait times are bearable on weekends (the wine loft makes it easy to wait).  Fantastic food - top choices are the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, meatballs app, all pizzas, and gnocchi.  Can't go wrong with anything though.  Dinner can be pricey but worth it for such good food and quality ingredients."
"1","This used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat. However I had such horrible service here on my last outing that I will NEVER return here again. The server was rude and ungrateful. She reminded me of Lindsay Lohan filming her reality show.\n\nThe atmosphere in the wine bar is fabulous and the food is decent. I really like the pizza and marinated vegetables. The meatballs are also excellent. Sadly I cannot support a business that provides such poor service."
"1","$20 for a personal pizza with cherry tomatoes, and \""some\"" smoked Gouda. \n\nNo salad. No meat. \nNo dice. \nBetter deals and better food at a mall food court."
"2","good pizza    the smoked mozzarella \n  is the best"
"2","First of all, Sarah was the most awesome waitress!!! Loved her wine selection suggestions, as well as dinner entree recommendations!\nThe Paccheri Alla Siciliana was a wonderful marinara sauce tossed with eggplant Fresh Bufula Mozzarella balls and was delicious! \nThe pappardelle al funghi, a delicious while wine and olive oil sauce, was tossed with pasta and shiitake mushrooms! \nBoth dishes were delicious and the amazing pure ricotta cannoli for dessert, excellent!!! \nHighly recommend this restaurant. We ate in the upstairs wine bar. But will definitely come back to sit in the beautiful courtyard garden!"
"2","Little Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced sushi, so it will always have a spot in my heart.  However, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best.  For one, I have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio, and they are one of my favorites.  Little Tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent.  My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.\n\nI would highly recommend Little Tokyo, especially over Sushi Two (or Three, I never can remember) on Beverly Road."
"2","This is by far the best Sushi in Pittsburgh.    The food is all amazing, very fresh and authentic,  and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo.  Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself.  \n\nWhat you wont find here:  A trendy atmosphere like Nakama ( I picked Nakama because it is also so popular in PGH), but the sushi MORE than makes up for it."
"2","Awesome sushi. Nigiri sushi here is a must-try."
"1","With prices this cheap,\nI expected bland sushi.\nBut hey, it's Pittsburgh."
"2","I love, LOVE this place.  The sushi at this place is what I use as a basis to compare other sushi.  I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.\n\nI should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!"
"2","Just arrived into town & had a taste for sushi! Remembered this place's reviews & after hitting a curb, damaging the hubcap of my rental I finally made it in! I ordered my sushi usual: ginger salad, spicy tuna & sushimi Ika. The ginger salad was good, but not great...I am spoiled when it comes to ginger dressing & this was not my favorite ginger dressing. The spicy tuna was fabulous! I got 3 pieces of Ika. They were good, but not the freshest I have had. My major complaint is that I asked for a side of sirachi & instead got just a hot oil...hmmmm..."
"2","Very good sushi.  Enjoyed all of it.  Great salad and soup as well.  Make reservations, esp on a weekend.  The only thing we DIDN'T like was the continual (loud) birthday celebrations."
"1","Let's face it,  this is not Japanese food. The food is ok but it is really more or less Chinese food. The soups taste Chinese and lack the umami quality because they are not hon-dashi based. The rice used for the sushi is totally incorrect long grain rice, and not properly vinegared."
"2","My husband and I ordered take out on a Saturday Night as our first experience with this place.  I really wanted sushi as I had just had a baby and it had been a LONG time since I got that craving met.  We were told it would be a half hour before it would be ready but that was fine because we had to drive to pick up anyway.  Upon arriving at the door, I could see that the place was hopping, all tables full and plenty of couples waiting to be seated.  The staff was fast, directing me over the the sushi bar where I checked out immeadiately.  As I was walking out the door I overheard the staff asking those waiting for tables if they would like to order a drink, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nWe ordered 6 different rolls. (The David, The First Date, The Pittsburgh, The American Dream, The Spicy Tuna and a Shrimp Tempura roll.)  The rolls were all placed into 2 containers and none of them were labeled.  But it really didn't matter because we loved it all!  \n\nBased on the price of the various rolls, I'm guessing that the David and the First Date were the ones we really liked the best!  We also got a large ginger dressing to go, as we had salads at home to eat, and it was also excellant!  We highly suggest that if you like ginger dressing, get this for your house as I have tried several different bottled brands in the grocery store and none have that distinct quality that is found in a ginger dressing from a hibachi place.Our total bill with tax was $66, but we really did get a lot of food."
"2","Nice light and open restaurant with two dining areas and a long sushi bar.  It was crowded with many families and a few singles at the sushi bar.  Ordered several different sushi rolls and was not disappointed....fresh and presentation was good.  Our server was very attentive and helpful.  She and others stopped by to check on us and refill our drinks."
"2","Love the dragon roll."
"2","Love their sushi here. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. There is on street parking, and also a parking garage across the street."
"1","Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass."
"1","Food was good, very average and just a bunch of rolls - nigiri and sashimi are kinda an afterthought. I wish the menu identified the ingredients. Instead I had to ask the server (really nice lady, but definitely not quick and efficient - service was soooo slow) who kindly explained each one. I ended up choosing two and they were good, more like meh good. Since I'm from SoCal, I definitely wouldn't go here when I'm back in Pittsburgh again and would try to find another sushi joint."
"2","Best spicy tuna that I've ever had.......because it's actually spicy and without the spicy (American) mayo."
"2","Second best sushi in Pittsburgh after Umi. Great uni and eel. Would recommend the sushi and sashimi over other dishes here."
"2","My girlfriend and I frequent this place as often as we can. Best sushi around by far. Lunch prices are awesome but you get their dinner quality of food. Favorites are probably black marlin, soft shell crab roll, yellow fun tuna, anything with eel, just about every entree and their ice cream! Oh man, I'm getting hungry typing this"
"2","This is amazing sushi.  I have not tried the hibachi but it is nice that they have it for dining with a mixed sushi/non sushi eating crowd.  \n\nThe sushi is spectacular and there is high attention to detail.  The miso soup is made completely from scratch, no cans.  The grated radish and other garnishes are made fresh daily.  There is no hint of staleness in anything.  The bartender is also generous in his pours.  We are never in a hurry when we go for sushi so I haven't paid too much attention to the time it takes but they always bring out the next item as we are finishing the previous.  We have frequented here for a little over a year and always leave very pleased.  \n\nFor the food quality and attention to detail the prices are also extremely reasonable."
"1","OK, update time.  Sushi we split was good.  Miso soup had an odd taste this visit.\nMy main course (Butaniku) was unforgettable, a real meh!  Not sure what happened this night.  \n\nOur waitress was MIA most of the night.  Could not even find her to try to get refills, desert or our check.  \n\nMust have been an off night for everyone."
"2","Some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Everything was really fresh and light which sushi should be, but this just seemed better. Hard to find a soft shell crab roll that the tempura is done well. This place does."
"1","I did not have a good experience here tonight. We did not make reservations and got seated within 10 minutes! We were happy about that but.. Waiting for our food took so long! We were ready to walk out and just cancel the order because of the wait.. But ended up waiting it out. \nThe food turned out okay. \n\nMiso soup- needed scallions and seaweed\nSalad- the dressing wasn't gingerly enough and tasted like Italian dressing. \n- the agedashi tofu was not agedashi tofu.. It was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled Chinese chilli. Ugh.. So disappointed. \n- sushi was okay. It was just average for me. \n \nThey were definitely quick with the check and cleaning at the end! \nOverall, didn't have a good experience and food was salty for my taste. :/"
"1","FILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISED\n\nWe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi.  The flavor was ok, we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done, was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegal?\n\nThe fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.\n\nThe miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.\n\nWe also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.\n\nThe waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price, time, gas and wear and tear on the car to get there."
"2","Service can boost a mediocre meal into the the arena of excellence.  \nWhen the food is consistently above average and the service, friendly and highly personable, and the prices reasonable, then...the meal is sublime.\nI gauge a good meal by my level of desire to return.  I will visit Little Tokyo for the level 4 food...and level 5 smile they paint on my face!"
"2","Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp, nutty crust."
"2","Stopped in for a couple quick slices of plain red sauce.  $1.60 each.  They were really great.  I loved the sauce, some of the best I have had.  I sprinkled some oregano over and it was great.  It was short of greatness, however, because of the amount of cheese.  Way too much and really hard to get down.  I would definitely go back and order a pie with 1/2 the amount of cheese and some toppings.  Some may love the cheese but I, like Darren, found it overwhelming."
"1","Horrible.  Tried it several times.  Taste like frozen Pizza.  Found a hair in it the first time so against my better judgement tried it again.  I swear it was worse than my first experience.  The locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds."
"2","My dad raves about this place and always encourages me to stop in. I finally gave in and stopped through one day on my way home from studying at Uptown. \nI ordered 2 slices of pepperoni to go for less than $5. I was sad that they didn't have an actual pepperoni pie; they just slapped pepperoni on the plain slices and tossed it in the over. That's my only complaint. \nWhen I got home, I was really excited to get to chewing. The bottom crust was crunchy and good (I couldn't eat the end bits of crust because it was a little hard). The pepperoni was authentic, thick, and spicy. The pizza was super greasy and cheesy, but flavorful and delicious. \nI will be trying again when I have the cash in my pocket."
"2","I love Panara, I hear some bad things about management but I don't believe the rumors. Anyway, Pittsburgh is sorely missing good bagel places and Panara comes through not only with bagels, but other great, fresh bakery items. \n\nGood soups and sandwiches, being vegan I love their offerings. Good coffee too, they have a french roast that puts Starbucks to shame."
"2","Needs more registers in the mornings. Mildly unorganized. But the breakfast sandwich is worth the wait."
"1","I went to five bridal salons before finding my dress, and Anne Gregory was definitely the worst.\n\nI scheduled my appointment a week in advance, yet the salon still did not provide anyone to help me dress---and those dresses can be tricky. The owner, Greg, was assisting me but obviously did not help me physically get into or out of the dresses. \n\nI had gone to Anne Gregory's to try on a specific gown that the designer's website indicated was in stock. Greg said that he had ordered it but it had not arrived yet. Ok, fair enough. I asked about another dress from the same designer that I was interested in and was also supposed to be at the store, and though he went to check on it, he never said one way or the other whether they actually had it there. \n\nI was disappointed by all this but still wanted to look at the dresses they did have. Instead of pulling dresses similar to what I wanted (dropped waist, full skirt) he continually brought out trumpet and mermaid dresses that are just not my style at all. Its nice that he found them flattering on me, but i was clearly not interested.\n\nWhen I left, I expressed how I had had my eye on the particular dress from the designer and how it was basically my dream dress and I still very much wanted to try it on. They promised that they would give me a call when it got in.\n\nThey never did. I saw it in the shop's window weeks later, but never got a phone call. I ended up getting a very similar dress from a shop that actually paid attention to what I wanted and called me back."
"1","Whooooo boy!!\n\nThis is a doosey.\n\nI got a call today from Anne Gregory. The man on the phone ( Brian?) asked if I posted a review online. I say yes.\n\nHe responds \""Well, I really wish you hadn't done that.\""\n\nwait. huh?\n\nThis guy then proceeds to berate me for giving them an unfavorable review. He brought up my complaint that they never called me back once they got the sample dress in, by saying that the reason for that was that the dress was far above my price range.  (I'm positive that this is true. While my budget wasn't modest, some of the dresses here can run well over 10k, so the fact that the dress wasn't feasible for me financially doesn't surprise me.)\n\nUnfortunately, I had asked and they had promised me that they would call whenever the dress came in. Had they phoned me and simply said that the dress was in, but it was far above my budget, that would have been fine and the fact that they followed up with me would have been reflected in my original review. Instead, they provided me with bad customer service by ignoring me because they guessed that they probably wouldn't be making any money anyway, so why bother with a 60 second task?\n\nAnd then this phone call....\n\nI'm not exaggerating at all, berate is absolutely the word to describe this. I didn't get much of a chance at all to respond to his explanation, and then this guys says \n\n\""I don't know what else to say except that I'm sorry that you feel that way. I just really hope that some day, people like you aren't able to do things like this.\""\n\nHoooo!\n\n If someone posts a negative review, unless that review is completely unfounded or is attacking someone personally unrelated to the job being performed, the business should either let it go, try to make sure the same problem doesn't occur again with a future customer, or do something to rectify the present situation. \n\nCalling the reviewer and attacking them personally for an honest and not really all that inflammatory assessment is just classless and immature. Even a pitch perfect business will get a negative review every now and then. \n\nIts such a shame too, because the conversation easily could have gone a different way had this guy truly cared about the store's reputation or understood good customer care. Though apologizing and explaining what happened probably wouldn't have changed my personal opinion of Anne Gregory, it would at least show that they care about their customer's experience and opinion of them. Clearly that's not the case. \n\nSuffice to say, the actions of at least one Anne Gregory employee have changed my original review from \""I didn't have a good experience, I would not do business with them\"" to SERIOUSLY.\nHOLY SHIT, DO NOT GO HERE."
"2","I ended up at Anne Gregory because they were the only place in Pittsburgh having a trunk show with a dress I saw online and really wanted to try on.  My maid of honor maid the appointment and a couple of my bridesmaids, my mom, and grandma came with me to try the dress on.  The experience was lovely and I ended up buying the dress.  A lady was originally helping me then the owner came out a little later on.  Let me tell you....this guy knows his stuff.  He made me feel totally at ease about the purchase.  It was like being a nice restaurant and the chef coming out to check on how your meal was.  I really appreciated him being there.  I wasn't buying the most expensive dress in the place but he certainly made me feel like I was.  It was really great.  I went to a few other places and this one is definitely the best."
"2","Wow! I cannot thank Anne Gregory enough for their help in finding my dream wedding dress. I am from Pittsburgh but currently live in NYC so I went all over NYC looking for the perfect wedding gown. When I couldn't find anything I was super frustrated. I don't think I am a picky person or hard to please so I couldn't understand why wasn't able to find 'the dress'. I was home in Pittsburgh with my mom doing some wedding planning this past week and was frantically trying to find 'the dress'. We came across Anne Gregory online and quickly made an appointment. After speaking with them on the phone I was convinced this would be the place and promptly canceled another appointment so that I could schedule one with Anne Gregory instead. And I am so thankful that I did because the first dress I tried on with them was the one I ended up purchasing. It had just been delivered by UPS minutes before I arrived in the shop and I was the first person to try it on. Greg and Mary Anne were working with my mom and I and they were perfect! Very friendly and helpful. Greg read me like a book and knew instantly what would look good on me. The dress I chose is so completely different from all the others I had been trying on and I never would have tried this type of dress on if it weren't for Greg. I am so glad I found him! The whole feel of the place is comforting and classy. I never felt rushed to make a decision-- and believe me when it came down to deciding between two dresses it took me awhile! In fact, after I decided on the dress Greg sat and talked to my mom and I for a half hour or so. He made us feel welcome. There is no doubt we are in good hands at Anne Gregory. From someone who looked all over NYC for a dress-- trust me-- just go to Anne Gregory-- you will be glad that you did!!"
"1","Dreadful, rude service- borderline bullies, poor selection, and they severely mark up their prices!!! Both my friend and I found a dress that they have at other stores for a fraction of the cost. Unacceptable. What a joke, really. Not at all what you want to have to endure while planning the most important outfit you'll ever wear! So upsetting!"
"1","My experience at Anne Gregory was fine, but nothing spectacular. They were running behind for my appointment because the seamstress accidentally put a future bride getting alterations in \""my room.\"" No problem. It's not like we were offered water, coffee, champagne, anything though. I showed them photos and style names of several dresses I wanted to try on and they said they'd go pull them and have them ready when my room was ready. When I got into the room, I wanted to try on my \""favorite\"" dress, but they hadn't pulled it for me! When they finally did, I had to basically trip around and put it on myself while the bridal consultant watched me. She was certainly no help. And pinning? They don't \""clip\"" at Anne Gregory. So imagine my size 0 body in a size 10 or size 12 dress. It was impossible to figure out what I would look like, and my consultant didn't really seem to care (or know how to adjust the dress to even give me a general idea). Any dresses they pulled for me that weren't on my list were awful - not even close to the look I described. This was also the only shop I went to that prohibited pictures. Overall, a pretty lousy experience. I just can't figure out why this place is considered the premiere bridal salon in Pittsburgh. No thanks"
"2","I got my dress for my July 2014 from Anne Gregory.  Overall, I liked my experience with the store.  \n\nI went to two bridal stores in Pittsburgh looking for my gown and was planning to visit two more in DC (my former residence) if I couldn't find anything locally.  My first visit was to Bridal Beginnings, which did a good job of finding dresses in the style I was seeking and in my budget, but which had pretty small sample sizes so it was incredibly difficult to picture how the back of the dress would look.   For reference, I am a street size 8-10.\n\nAnne Gregory's sample sizes seemed to be a size up from the ones at Bridal Beginnings, which was enormously helpful.  They also did a good job of picking things that were clearly within the style I was looking for, as well as some a little out of the box, but not too far, which they wanted me to take a shot at.  I ended up with a dress that I loved for almost half of my total budget.   I didn't want to go over $2,500 for a dress alone, and ultimately my dress, alterations and a very basic veil were under that amount.  \n\nSome points were lost as I didn't love their collection of veils and accessories (it would have been nice to have a one stop shop) and their alterations schedule was difficult, forcing me to schedule fittings, including the last fitting, a little sooner than I would have liked.  Also, I should note that the stores in Pittsburgh lack some atmosphere.  While Anne Gregory's was better than BB, there were still no drinks, champagne, snacks, etc. for my attendants, which is standard in larger cities and which smaller cities like Buffalo are even catching on to.  \n\nIn the end, I would have liked them to go that little extra step to streamline the experience, especially given the price of alterations and accessories, but I was still pleased with my experience."
"2","Even though the baked goods are not made on the premises here - they are brought in from the main Dormont location - it smells like a bakery should.  There was so much to choose from - fresh baked bread, cookies, doughnuts, beautiful cakes, cannoli, etc.  I was even lucky enough to buy the last two paczki in the store.  One was filled with chocolate buttercream and drizzled with a chocolate glaze.  The other one was filled with whipped cream, fresh strawberries, and dusted with powdered sugar.  They were both fresh and delicious and worth the trip (although they won't be available until Feb again).  One note - we visited here once on Monday and there was basically nothing to be had in the store.  The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality of most of the baked goods.  Make sure to visit on the weekends when they are stocked to the rafters with goodies!"
"2","I recently got married, and during our engagement, my fiance and I went out for cake-testing. We went to Prantl's and Potomac. At Potomac, a woman sat down with us, had us taste cake with several different fillings (chocolate cream, lemon, raspberry, plain buttercream) and sketched out my idea of how I wanted the cake to look. We looked through old photos of their past cakes, and she really listened to us. At Prantl's? They threw us a box of tasting cakelets, most of which were stale, and had us fill out a sheet. No one on one, no personal touch. Of course, we went with Potomac! \n\nThe wedding cake arrived on time and in perfect condition! The design was exactly what I asked for (I emailed them pictures of Hungarian embroidery designs) and the colors were vibrant and just perfect! The raspberry filling was so good, and the buttercream was perfect as well. We saved the top tier... but couldn't wait a year to eat it. We waited just over one week and polished it off! \n\nI highly recommend Potomac bakery for a beautiful buttercream (not fondant) wedding cake. So wonderful to work with, and what a tasty dessert!"
"2","Potomac Bakery is pretty darn wonderful - this is one of the places my family will often go to when we need a cake or cookies for special events. Everything is always fresh and the dough and icing or other toppings always taste really good, rather than too strong or too \""meh,\"" which is a common problem with other bakeries. \n\nI went in to pick up a snack today and found all of the display cases were full with Easter-themed treats; it was quite the colorful display, and it smelled delicious! I also love the fact that the bakery sells little milk bottles and tea cartons - you'll definitely need a drink to wash down any and all sweet treats you pick up here. \n\nOne major drawback: nowhere in the store did I see a sign mentioning that there's a $10 minimum if you want to use a debit or credit card. Not a big deal, unless you're like me and you don't typically carry cash. Fortunately, I had just enough quarters in my wallet to cover my small purchase here today. \n\nSo. If you're looking to place a big order or two? All the thumbs up for this place! But if you just want a snack...well, be ready to take a minute to stop by an ATM first, if your bank is nearby."
"2","Decent bakery in the heart of Mt. Lebo. I strolled in (literally-baby on board!) on a Tuesday afternoon for a treat after having lunch at Little Tokyo. The bakery was empty and the staff later came out after hearing the door. Young girl who seemed bothered by the fact that I was there. I asked a couple questions and got short one or two word replies. Ultimately, I couldn't pass up the gourmet brownies with peanut butter icing. There was also a raspberry version. The \""brownie\"" tasted more like a cake. Moist and delicious. The peanut butter topping was fluffy and sweet. $3.50 was a bit much for this six inch boat shaped brownie but, the rest of their cakes and cookies were reasonably priced. 30 cents per cookie. $6 and $7 pies. Overall, I will definitely head back when I am in the area. Hopefully, the staff is having a better day . . .\n\nDon't forget our cash!"
"1","This theatre definitely needs a re-haul!  The theatre is older and doesn't have stadium seating or some of the better amenities that the newer theatres are offering such as an expanded menu.  While I prefer going to the theatre located closer to the South Hills Village mall, I will venture out here if the movie I want to see isn't playing there (which is rare).  \n\nThis theatre isn't as crowded, but me thinks it's b/c it's just not as nice.  I went for a movie here this weekend and there was no visual for the first 5 minutes.  We told the staff and they had to rewind the movie - which is no biggie - but the other patrons kept saying that this happens quite often at this theatre.  \n\nI think a little renovation would greatly help this establishment - if you can avoid this theatre and go with one with all the bells and whistles!"
"1","This is a crappy, dark theater that leaks water when it rains. Do not go!"
"1","Way worse than what I remember as a kid, probably because I was a kid. The screens were tiny and the women's restroom smelled of stale piss. Two-thirds of the sinks were non-functional and at least 2 stalls did not have functional locks. The staff was friendly, but the place is old, run down in appearance and a little gross. At least my feet didn't stick to the floor in the theater. \n\nIt's a movie theater. If you are already in The Galleria and want to see a movie and are willing to pay theater prices for this place, it'll suffice. Odds are, you'd get a better experience at home."
"1","Such a shame. Terrific location, supported by the community and just awful. Filthy, bad seats, more expensive than others. Choose to go elsewhere."
"2","This is my favorite movie theater in the South Hills area. It's been recently remodeled which makes it really nice. Located in the Galleria. \n\nSeats are huge and comfortable. Plenty of leg room and large arm rests. Overall the entire theater seemed clean, including bathrooms. \n\nAs expected, prices on candy, popcorn, drinks, etc, are of course outrageous. This theater does offer a popcorn bucket which you can buy and use for the entire year giving you a discount on future popcorn purchases."
"2","Great place to catch the big game (or not so big games) while enjoying great atmosphere and prices. Staff very friendly, including the owner who went the extra mile for our group once. Little things like that keep me coming back. Good Golden Tee machine in an out-of-the-way nook. I've always met interesting people when I go to the Saloon. Food is also great. It's bar fare, but very good. Great vibe and great crowd."
"1","Why does this place always smell bad? Seriously, the second you walk through the door it's vaguely sewer-ish. Their roof deck is okay, and I am honestly glad that not every establishment in Lebo is high-end, but overall I'm not a fan."
"2","The Saloon is one of the best sports bars in Pittsburgh.  Tons of new TVs so you can see the game from any angle.  Sure you can go to the Southside, but then you have to deal with the zombie scene.  Seriously, that place has so many red-eyed, foaming-at-the-mouth people stumbling around it looks like George Romero is filming again.  I'd rather go to The Saloon where I can watch the Steelers/Pens in a festive, but not out of control atmosphere, and have a good time with my friends.\n\nGreat bar menu and beer selection as well.  The wings are the best in town."
"2","Any place that puts Yuengling on special on Saturday night is going to get a second look from me. So I went in, and I saw the sort of popular and unassuming place that every neighborhood should have. But this was a little better. The bar has a good 15-20 taps and a huge liquor selection.\n\nI ordered the buffalo wings -- hot -- and I really liked them. They had good meat on them and the hot sauce had decent flavor to it. Seems like this place puts decent effort into quality food and drink, and the atmosphere speaks for itself."
"2","There's two saloons in the South Hills. I was confused between Cain's and The Saloon of Mt. Lebo because they're both the \""Saloon.\"" Maybe it's like the Wild Wild West and they're feuding. In any case...\n\nIf it were to that angle, I'd be hard pressed to say which one would win the shoot out. I liked Cain's because it was clean, tons of beer choices and good bar food. BUT, even though this place is a little darker, a little more \""aged\"" as I'll lovingly put it... they had some darn good wings. And beer selection. But those wings. They were crispy, the sauce was tangy and plentiful, plus it was just plain hot wings and they were delicious!\n\nSo the joint looks like it may have seen some better days... if you serve me some bangin' hot wings that are making me dream about them later and a row of around 30+ beers on tap, I'm in! I'll be back to demolish some wings..."
"2","The Mt. Lebanon Saloon is such a happy hangout for my entire family. It's a perfect bar atmosphere with lots of aged dark wood and beer taps with fabulous selections lining both sides of the bar. There are plenty of TVs all around the bar and dining area - after all it is Pittsburgh! They offer up a big basket of popcorn (aka 'crack') as soon as you sit down. No one in our family can stop eating it until the basket is empty. \n\nThe wings are delicious and I wish I could say my favorite buffalo chicken sandwich was also still a delight but the last time I had it, somebody messed with the recipe and not in a good way. I sincerely hope this was a fluke and they bring back the old buffalo chicken sandwich.......please! \n\nThere's a wide array of burgers, hoagies and sandwiches to choose from on the menu that range from good to really good. It's bar food not fine dining but its always fun in there and the beer selection and atmosphere rocks!!"
"1","I have been robbed twice by the Saloon. \n\n Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  \n\nI went in on some Yeungling special night, ordered one beer, and wrote a dollar tip.  The next morning I checked my statement and I had been charged 25.00 for that single beer.  This is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud.  But they will keep saying it was an 'accident' as long as they can get away with it.  If you do have to go here I IMPLORE you to only use cash and look at your change carefully. \n\nThis bar should be your absolute last resort in Mt Lebanon.\n\nAt closing time as well, get ready for the Mt Lebo Police Dpt to pull up outside and start hassling people who are WALKING HOME.  \n\nThere are other great bars in Mt Lebanon that are far more deserving of your money."
"1","This place is just okay.  Food isn't that great.  It's kind of dark & dingy.  Lots of TV's though.  I prefer Cain's Saloon...just right down the road."
"1","If you are close to the area and you simply want a cheap beer with friends on a cold night, go for it. Just don't expect to get anything else out of it. The bartenders are pretty attentive and make strong drinks but I can't say the same for the food -- it's downright disgusting. \n\nThe ambiance is a little strange. After sporting events, they blast a collection of random music that has no flow. The crowd consists mostly of guys in their late 20s who wear beanies and fedoras and like to hunt the crowd in their high school wolf packs and cougars who most likely live in the area."
"1","Decent bar atmosphere with dark wood and tavern like feel to it.  Being that it is a bar, I was actually surprised by the amount of families. But, a neighborhood bar to say the least. Came on St. Patty's weekend around lunchtime which meant this place was packed wall to wall. We eventually found a high top and were able to watch both the Pitt and Pens games. They have several TVs in all different angles which is really nice when it's packed and you don't really have to worry about finding a place near one single tv or anything. \n\nIt was kind of a mess, but because it was a packed holiday weekend, I'll cut them a break. The food wasn't that good at all.. I had the Reuben sandwich and my friend had a chicken salad. Yes, it's a bar, but I've had good food at several bars before. The service was also overwhelmed and really slow. You would've been better off walking up to the bar and ordering a drink on your own. Needless to say, it wasn't a horrible experience by any means, but I wasn't impressed."
"1","So this place is a smoker friendly pub, located next to Jernigan's Tobacco Village in The Galleria.  \nLooking into the pub, it looks like an olde English gentleman's study,\nwhich is why I thought it'd be fun to go here.  I had also read an article about this place that sang it's praises.  \n\nDon't bother eating here.  I think this is one of those places that only sells food so they can allow indoor smoking.\n\nService (there was ONE bartender working the entire place) Is slow, food is overpriced and poorly made.\nI ordered what was described as a vegetarian sandwich, what I got was a poorly made (and TINY) calzone."
"1","At the pub/restaurant side I had a very bad experience, terrible food, even worse service.  A complete waste of money, avoid at all costs."
"1","The following is an email that i sent jernigan's management about an experience that i had in their pub. Mind you, it seems that the only reason that they have a \n\""pub\"" is to allow indoor smoking. Do not visit the pub. I have vowed to not shop at this store at all since i had such a bad experience AND they did not try to remedy my experience. In this day and age it seems that businesses no longer strive to satisfy the customer, just make it OK for them. The email below describes my experience. I did not receive a satisfactory reply from management. \n\nMy wife, a friend, and I visitied Jernigan's Tobacco Village yesterday, 2/20/2012, and I want to let you know of the poor service that we recieved. We arrived and promptly bought some cigars to take into the pub. Mind you, this was our first visit to the pub, since I was waiting for one of my friends to turn 21 as he has recenlty. Needless to say, we have had this trip planned for quite some time and had been looking forward to it. So we took a seat in the pub, looked at the menu a bit, and waited for quite some time for the bartender to come out to us from behind the bar. When he finally did, he got us our drinks and then left us without asking if we would like anything to eat. And we had been planning on getting something to eat also. Being this was my first visit to the pub, i wasn't sure if food was being served or not, so i went to the bar to ask if that was the case and he merely told me that he would be over in a minute to take our food order. He never came back to our table to ask us if we needed another drink, or to ask us if we wanted to order any food. I was very surprised at this since i had even asked him about our food order in the first place. So we let it go until we had finished our drinks and cigars which, as  i am sure you can understand, took some time. In that time he never came back over to us and instead, chatted with some patrons at the bar and even came to wait on another table and completely ignored us. After we were completely finished with our single drink and cigar, he finally came over and I simply asked for the check. When i payed for the check, he brought our change back and tossed it on the table, declared the amount of chage, and walked away. No \""Have a nice night\"" or anything like that. We were all completely disappointing in this experience since we had been looking forward to this for quite some time. We were prepared to spend some time, and money, in your establishment but this experience has definitely turned us away. And on a personal note, i feel as if we were discriminated against because we are not the usual older clientele that i am sure you are used to serving in your pub. Our ages ranged in our 20s and i feel that we were looked at as immature children just pretending to be adults. As i stated, another table of older gentlemen were served twice more and we were never waited on. We all felt very uncomfortable, since we had never been there before, and felt as if we were being pushed out. My check information is listed below:\n\nCheck number 150360\nServer: Fred\nDate 2/20/2012 Time 7:33PM\n\nI wanted to bring this information to your attention. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n     Frank Ramaglia Jr.\n\n\nAs it seems from the other reviews here, Jernigan's does not like or want to serve food. If it is that hard for them to do then it should not be on the menu at all. Instead of disappointing customers they could simply remedy this problem by taking the option of food away."
"1","I have been going here for years to buy cigars.....even when they were upstairs in the mall. But I have always been a little skeptical about the bar(I am a drinker) and the premise under which they exist. They offered no food for sale today, and in fact a customer ordered Chinese food on his cell phone to be delivered to the pub so that he  could eat dinner. The barmaid sat at the bar the whole time I was there...smoking and chatting up her buds. Avoid at all cost. Had to ask for a drink each time, and for the check. But cigar shop is very good"
"1","This place would be nice in theory except for 2 very important things.  1 there service is awful, 2 there prices are awful. There are several other places a cigar smoker can go with much better service and prices. Smoke cigar lounge in collier, the oyster house in pleasant hills, castle tavern in castle shannon, chippino in the strip,level 40 in robinson etc."
"1","I've gone to Rollier's a lot over the years whenever I needed a personal touch - something you can't get at places like Home Depot.  Last week I went in with a busted window screen frame.  I wanted to replace it, and Rollier's has built replacement screens for me in the past.  For some reason, this time, MT in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one.  He told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldn't fit.  (Later I determined that not to be true - its the same size.)  He said instead he could put a brace across the frame.  OK I said.  I'm always open to saving $50+.  Well that brace added at least 1/8\"" thickness to the frame.  Now it won't fit.  If he was concerned that a new frame would not fit, why would he think this very thick brace would?  I had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window.  So he wasted my time, probably over 2 gallons of $4/gallon gas, and took $25.67 from me.   So much for the personal touch.  I think I will stick for the impersonal honesty of Home Depot for now on."
"2","Have a home project or problem...ask the experts at Rolliers.  They can help you fix it or they repair many things like screens and lamps.\n\nNeed seasonal lights and decorations.  Rolliers has it.  Check out the Xmas display of Studio 56 stuff!  The kids love it!  Big kids Too!\n\nGreat place to pick up items and get assistance.  Need some work cloths, Rolliers has it.  Need paint, window blinds, household items, electrical items, Rolliers has it.\n\nThe staff just assisted teaching me in how to repair a few items and help save me a ton of $'s!  \n\nPrice wise most items are competitive with other hardware places.  Sometimes a little more but the experts are worth it."
"2","This is a Fantastic Hardware Store. I found a really old chrome 1930's FAN at trader jack's flea market last Sunday.\n SUPER COOL FIND !\nanyway , it had a dryrotted electric cord and a bad 3 speed pull chain type switch.\nRolliers had an exact replacement for the switch and a retro vintage looking cloth covered electric cord. I was very impressed.\nThe Staff was very helpful and happy to assist me.  ( unlike the jagoff's at lowes and home depot)\nSupport Local !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nI cant stress this enough !\nWith some advice and tip's from my favorite electronics store in Squirrel hill. \nMy fan is all cleaned up and running like a top."
"1","So here's the thing... we bought a house in Dormont and it was so nice to discover a \""larger\"" hardware store that wasn't a big box name. Plus, it's only a mile from my place, perfect!\n\nSo I head here for a quick pick-up for some three-way switches (ordered by the handyman who was working on my electric at home). I had no clue what I was looking for and had saved a note on my phone. \n\nI walk in and find the first person I see. A woman who was in a Rollier's apron, standing by a cash register reading the Post-Gazette. I asked her politely if she worked there. She slowly responded \""yeah\"" hardly looking up. I read off what I needed from my phone and again, barely looking up, pointed to the back and said \""lighting, in the back.\""\n\nI stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off. Customer service is so important... and I would expect a locally owned hardware store to have excellent customer service. Why? I guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible. But compared to the excellent service I experienced at Home Depot every time I've been in, this was a real letdown. \n\nI did find a nicer employee who showed me exactly what I needed in the back, but still. I won't say I'll never go in again, but it definitely left a sour taste in my mouth."
"2","Yes, their prices are a little high compared to competitors but there's something to be said for the local mom and pop hardware store.  You can actually get help here from people who know what they are doing....not the experience I had at the local Home Depot.  I'm grateful to have this place just around the corner and will NEVER go to the HD again.  Besides they carry some really great things you can't get at those big box stores."
"2","Wow! I absolutely love this place. For its location on route 19 in central Mount Lebanon, this place is gigantic. It has its own dedicated parking lot in the back, which is great because parking in the ares is always a bit problematic. \n\nThis is a great little hardware store with all the smaller items of a typical store, but a little less in terms of large items like wood, fencing, etc. It's also a bit confusing with the layout, and I got separated from my family and lost in the store. It was a glorious kind of lost though, because I love hardware stores. This place has a lot of nicer high-end fixtures like lighting and faucets that I haven't seen at the big-time stores. \n\nIn addition to traditional hardware items, this place carries some kitchen supplies, camping and outdoor gear. They had a great selection of reasonably-priced Carhart gear in the center of the store that I was eyeing for Christmas gifts, and I also saw an aisle full of ceramic teapots that I reluctantly avoided to prevent unnecesary spending. This place is great for browsing DIY-ers and people who just love to roam hardware stores, like me. \n\nI went here at the beginning of October and they have a great selection of adorable Halloween decorations. The center of the store has a giant table full of sale items, including last-season decorations and random knick knacks. I didn't get a chance to explore the place in depth so I can't say too much about its inventory or prices, but it's a wonderful, large, convenient, and interesting store and I can't wait to go back."
"2","Awesome spot with good beer, a pool table, darts, and even board games. Haven't been there when it's busy so service was always top notch."
"2","Flowers for my July wedding turned out gorgeous, I'd highly recommend Mt. Lebanon Floral!  (my bouquets/centerpieces were faith roses with cream hydrangea)"
"1","I don't frequent the Galleria very much but go to their movie theater every once in a while.  The theater is outdated and old - you would think for their target clientele they would give the movie theater an upgrade.  The stores that I enjoy here include, Anthropologie, Williams-Sonoma and Charming Charlie.  \n\nThey also have some decent chain restaurants like Mitchells, Houlihans, Bravo and Panera if you are hungry after watching a flick."
"2","This is a nice small mall. Some of my favorite shops are Anthropologie & Pottery Barn Kids. There's a Starbucks and Panera inside. No problem with parking and the mall isn't overcrowded at all."
"2","Ohhh the Galleria....  the mall where there is a 100% chance I'm going to find something I want to buy and a 0% chance I'll be able to afford it.\n\nIf I am going out for dinner and a movie though, this is where I go.  They have a great selection of restaurants there, and that movie theater.  \n\nI LOVE Anthropologie but I can neither afford nor fit into their $85 size 0 tshirts.  But I'm all about their jewelry and housewears.\n\nI always stop down at Crabtree and Evelyn, I'm so afraid this place is going to go out of business.  this store is like Bath & Body Works outrageously glamorous and wealthy elderly Aunt.  But let me tell you--their Fresh Cut Rose perfume is literally man bait.  \n\nTheres lots of parking, the mall is beautiful inside, and I do teh bulk of my xmas shopping there because I KNOW I will always be successful there, and I have all year to save up for it.\n\nSometimes they even have luxury car shows, which always makes me chuckle bc I think to myself, \""Isn't that EVERY DAY in the parking lot?\"""
"1","Here's the short version: Beware of using a camera in the Galleria! You are likely to become the target of the mall cop and be harassed no matter how innocent your use happened to be, even if you were just taking a picture of a friend of yours. You will have an embarrassing and humiliating experience. Management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize. And, no, I'm not making this up.\n\nHere's the full story: On August 18th 2014 I met my friend George for breakfast at Panera Bread, my favorite restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. We sat together for a little more than an hour engaged in deep conversation. He then asked me to take some head shots of him for publicity purposes so I suggested we walk out into the lobby area of the Galleria to do that. The conversation had been so pleasant and the weekend so lovely that I plumb forgot about how shopping malls have \""no photography\"" policies. Nor of course was there any such notification posted between Panera and the mall. My sole purpose was to show George's face and to keep the background as blurred as possible. That's what defines a \""head shot.\""\n\nI took a few shots with potted plants as a backdrop and then a few more in the central area with posts and beams in the background. Altogether I took nine pictures of George and then we walked to the main exit of the mall on the top floor near Panera to get in his car. Suddenly a man in a Polo shirt ran up to us and vehemently began questioning me about what I had been \""up to\"" and loudly asserting that photography was forbidden in the Galleria. I tried to explain that I had simply taken a few close-ups of George and that I had no interest in depicting the mall and, in fact, had not done so. But the security guy was on a tear. He would not listen to anything I had to say and kept insisting that I had committed a very serious infraction and that he would have to \""detain\"" me, though he never made clear what the point of detaining me might possibly be. By his outraged tone of voice, domineering body language, and accusatory words any passer-by would have assumed that I had broken Anthropologie's window, sprayed paint on Houlihan's marquee, or at the very least had just shoplifted a chocolate bar from the Godiva store.\n\nThe mall cop continued despite apologies and explanations. He threatened to call the police. (And what would they have done with such a flakey complaint?) Though I was under no obligation to do so, I even showed him the pictures I had taken of George to assure him that no crucial mall information had been compromised. Much to my chagrin he then said, \""There's ninety more pictures on that card and I want to see 'em all.\"" He could not be mollified by any recourse to reason. Finally his supervisor showed up and when the situation was explained she allowed as how we could proceed on our way with no further hassle.\u00a0\n\nThis experience of rudeness, bureaucratic intolerance, and downright absurdity left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been so easy for the guard to have said something like, \""Sir, photography is not allowed at the Galleria mall.\"" To which my response would have been, \""Oh I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that.\"" At this point the exchange would have ended amicably and with mutual respect. That's what I would call a reasonable way of enforcing a policy. As it is, I believe Galleria has overstepped it's bounds and made the experience of doing business there about as pleasant as shopping in North Korea.\u00a0\n\nI wrote an email about this experience and emailed it to the person listed as mall manager, Gine Mercorelli. It was returned as \""undeliverable.\"" I also contacted three executives of Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. (the operators of the mall). All three had valid email addresses. None of them responded to me. \n\nMy advice: find a more pleasant mall where you will not be treated as a criminal for snapping a selfie with your cell phone."
"1","Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware has the worst customer service ..stay away."
"2","I love this La Pomponnee wayyyyy more than the peters township one. It's less cluttered and everyone is really friendly.\n\nMy stylist is Jessica and I can't say enough good things about her. I think she is one of their junior stylists but she gives a great haircut! She actually listens and she doesn't push products on you. However I loved how she styled my hair so I ended up buying everything she used because I needed products and you know I have seen a huge difference in my hair. \nShe even told me some cute ways to style my hair which is great for me cause my hair is a pain! \n\nI spent around $100 on products and for a haircut, wash, blow dry and style was $30 which is a great price! But the haircut prices vary by stylist.\n\nNow this is why they lose a star .. I got my hair highlighted here last summer and no my girl Jess didnt do them! Since it was summer I asked for partial highlights and I didn't get my haircut cause I used a groupon at another salon to get it cut. I was charged $85 for my partial highlights which I thought was a little expensive just for that! They did look great and the stylist listened to what I wanted which was great but they faded really really fast. Yes I know it was summer but I also did buy the 2 products that are supposed to help prevent that. But oh it happens.\n\nAlso Mindy is great for waxing! She is quick, friendly and makes you feel really comfortable. Her prices are great too. \n\nTry it out and ask for Mindy or Jess you won't be disappointed!"
"1","La Pomponnee, I wanted to like you.  I really did. \nI've gone about 5 times for various services, and each time hoped to get what I felt I was paying for, but always have left rejected.  Literally.  The staff at La Pomp is AWFUL!  Many of them are rude and act like you are a hindrance on their day even though it is their job.  I have heard the staff gossiping - sometimes even about other customers - on multiple occasions.  And when I've had my hair done at this salon, I am left in the middle of my hair cut  so my stylist can attend to someone else, while I just sit there with my hair dripping.\nThe one thing is (and why they get 2 stars instead of 1), is that they DO tend to do a  good job on my hair.  The massage I got was so-so, expensive, and ended with a sales pitch - not relaxing.  But hair, they can do.  I just can't make it worth my time, if it's too expensive and I feel as if I'm being kicked out the door so the staff can talk crap about me once I'm gone.\nI have been to a million different spas over the years (I am a facial whore!).  Maybe the spas in Pittsburgh aren't as up to par as the one's I've gotten used to in San Diego.  But La Pomponnee has not been a good spa experience for me for massages or hair styling.\nI'll be going to Stonewater from now on."
"1","I went here for the first time on a recommendation. I did not request a specific stylist, and told them I could do an appointment \""any time this week.\"" I received a decent cut, but left promising the receptionist that I would NEVER return.\n\nOnline, their women's haircut price is quoted at $30+. I get a very basic cut, so I expected it to be $30, $35 at most. Only when I checked out was I informed that my cut was actually $44. When I asked why the cost was so much higher than their base quote, the receptionist told me the cost is based on the experience of the stylist. My stylist -- the one chosen for me WITHOUT revealing this policy -- has been working at the salon for 13 years.\n\nI understand this unit of commensuration -- although, I think it's bad for business because it insinuates a customer will receive a much lower quality experience if the stylist is younger. However, if this is a salon policy, it is one that should be CLEARLY stated upon scheduling the appointment.\n\nFrom my perspective, La Pomponnee preyed upon my naivety and (seemingly deliberately) chose the most expensive stylist. This is downright terrible customer service, and it will be the reason they eliminated any chance of a long-term relationship."
"2","With the colder weather picking up in the Pittsburgh area - it's easy to get dry wind-chapped skin and to just want to stay indoors.\n\nLa Pomponee not only will nourish your skin with lovely all natural products and a soft touch - but they'll have you looking so radiant that you'll be aching to take your glowing cheeks out.\n\nI came here with my mom when we were visiting my brother and all of their staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.\n\nThey provided lush robes, a private locker for our stuff, and even gave us new flip-flops. My facialist was so lovely and warm and she massaged love and kindness into my skin using Aveda's magical all natural products. She even did some hand and feet massaging as well. So blissful!\n\nMy facial had no extractions or un-natural chemicals applied to it. It was all about nourishing the skin. It's reassuring to know that you're going to walk into a facial and come out with soft supple skin - rather than a face full of red marks and peeling. I would definitely come to La Pomponee again - for a relaxing day full of epic massage and good vibes.\n\nIf you're looking for more vigorous facial and want more pronounced results - you may want to look elsewhere. For simple natural glowing skin though - La Pomponee is the way to go.\n\nTrust."
"1","This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized, they just said \""we get a lot of elderly people in here so we often lose our patience.\""  They still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card.  If you want to be treated with respect and have competent, respectful service, DO NOT get your prescriptions here."
"2","When I was younger, my friend and I went to this CVS and started interviewing strangers on camera.  (\""Have you ever been to Alaska?\"" \""What color are your socks?\"")  We used to spray BOD all around.  We painted ourselves blue from head to toe and acted casually.  We were terrors.  They put up with us, and now I am a loyal customer in return.  I've never once had a bad experience.  I live close, so I roll on over whenever I want a new nail polish color.  As decisive as my motives are, it takes me at least a half hour to choose each time.  They have a lot of colors."
"1","I have no problem with the product of the actual store but the delivery service they use is delivering the piece of furniture I got 1 week and a half after I bought (even though it was in stock at the store) on a weekday with a 4 hour time frame. I paid $125 for shipping. What a rip off, I will never buy anything from restoration hardware again."
"2","I adored Uptown Coffee as a middle- and high-school student, mostly due to its proximity to the school.  It is a great, mellow place to hang out for hours.  Their drinks and desserts are always delicious, and they used to serve sandwiches.  They seem to have gone through a makeover since I graduated, and now it is much better lit, though the much-beloved couch is no longer.\nUptown Coffee is a great alternative to Starbucks and a great place to spend a few hours catching up with friends."
"2","Where else but Uptown could you get huge homemade biscotti for $2 and Hungarian-language lessons for free?  I noticed that the sugar container said \""Sugar\"", and also \""Azucar\"" (Spanish), and... \""Cukar\"".  I asked if that was Turkish.  No, said the cute guy behind the counter, that's Hungarian.  (Turkish would have been \""seker\"", I learned later.)\n\nI know only one phrase in Hungarian, I said: \""Halv\u00e1ny fogalmam sincs\"".  He smiled and said it in English: \""I have no idea.\""  A useful phrase to know, he agreed.\n\nThe coffee drinks here are simple but good.  The names are fanciful; espresso with milk and a Torani shot is an \""Elizabethan\"".  Dunking your biscotti into a good coffee, however, is an Uptown pleasure that will cost you surprisingly little -- and the sidewalk tables are a great way to add some Mt. Lebanon ambience."
"1","Weird experience.  \n\nI asked what they use for their Chai Latte and they said they have their own \""mix.\""  I'm here to tell you... I have no clue what they gave me.  I felt like it was peppermint spiced tea, with half water half steamed milk.  It was pretty gross, and wasn't even remotely close to a Chai latte. \n\nI also tried to make convo with the Barista's.  They were having none of that.  They just wanted to work, I guess.  Maybe jam to their awesome playlist, which I can definitely give them credit for.  \n\nTheir desserts and pastries looked amazing!  So I had to take home some cookies.  I chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie.  The sugar cookie was that weird crumbly kind.  I like doughy goodness.  I'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie.  The mexican cookie was just the same consistency.  Ugh!\n\nToo bad, the place is super cute, but in my opinion it's an utter fail.  Oh wait, free internets.  Not a total loss... Sorry buds!"
"2","This is a great place with good products that serves and caters to everyone.  I would miss it terribly if it was not there."
"1","Mediocre sandwiches and milk shakes. Also, the woman behind the counter was very rude and had a terrible attitude."
"2","This is the go-to cafe in Mt. Lebanon nowadays. There's plenty of room and the space is welcoming. \n\nThe coffee is terrific and the barista welcomes and chats with customers. The pastries and sweets are always evolving, so every time you visit there will be something new to try."
"2","Great local coffee shop. I come here a few times a week to work, and the free wifi and spacious seating are much appreciated. It can get loud at times, but nothing headphones won't fix. \n\nLove their iced coffee and iced tea of the day, especially the acai green tea. The pumpkin chocolate chip bread is really moist and delicious as well."
"1","Not a huge fan of their coffee, the cookies and pastries are really good, however! The lemonade is amazing. The lady who works their, is super rude and never smiles. The customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers."
"2","A recent discovery of mine and I'm glad that I found it!  I loved the home-y feel of this place. There were lots of tables to work on, each with it's own individualized lamp! The artwork on the walls were fun to look at. The cup sizes for iced drinks are really big! A small is the equivalent of at least a medium (if not bigger) at a place like Starbucks. I'm lactose intolerant so I get soy milk but they don't charge me extra for it! (Usually $0.70 or more elsewhere). Parking is tricky but I always find a spot..plus the location is on a nice strip with other stores and offices so parking further down the street is worth the stroll."
"1","Wish there was a choice of NO stars.  I was in this hospital for 5 very long days and it was a HORRIBLE experience.  I had a kidney infection and pneumonia and had to spend the first night in ER.  No rooms available.  There was no noise control so sleep was impossible.  Finally got a room the next day only to be kicked out because they shut the ward down over the weekend (!).  Absurd.  All I wanted was sleep - so they put me in a room full of loud visitors (I was supposed to have a private room).  Horrible experience."
"2","This is a fun shoe store in a great neighborhood. Prices are reasonable. The selection is great, but they were out of my size in several shoes that I wanted to try. Service was average."
"1","The place has a quaint look about it, which is why I decided to try it last week. I have to say, that's THE ONLY positive thing I have to say about this place, everything else is TERRIBLE :(\n\nI can't talk about all of their shoes (some look better than other) but the patent pumps they sell, especially the one they sold ME, were extremely poor quality and overpriced - you can get the same shoes from Macy's for much better prices and they won't give you the fake brands either.\n\nWhat happened to me is that the shoe I wanted was on display in another size on the rack and the guy who works there brought me some other shoe from their storage - it looked about the same if you don't look closely but the it is a fake. The quality is really low, it had a different type of lining and sole color, but he claimed it's the same shoe and if I wanted it in that size I had to buy it. Well, either the brand makes really lousy shoes (which I doubt) or the fake brand shoes I got home with me were just not the real thing because I couldn't break them in and after wearing them for about an hour I was in real pain - they not only hurt my feet but the heel tips were so lousy that they immediately got scuffed (they're basically cheap plastic).\n\nLesson learned: even if the shoe looks good on the outside (almost like the authentic brand!) and even if it's sold on Walnut Street, it might not be worth the $50 \""deal.\"" Do yourself a favor, go to a real shoe store (like the Littles Shoes in Squirrel Hill, etc.), this is a terrible boutique with overpriced and poor quality merchandise and I would highly recommend against buying their stuff.\n\nLast thing, I don't think people appreciate being called \""honey\"" in a condescending voice by someone who only cares about profit, and being told lies for that matter! And not giving real receipts (they use hand written ones!) along with a strict 7-day return policy makes it clear they don't want you to have a chance to change your mind (which you will!)...and who knows what other reasons they have for maintaining such lousy policies considering the quality of their merchandise.\n\nI rest my case: AVOID Ten Toes on Walnut ladies!!! Go to Francesca's, go to Banana Republic, just pass right by Ten Toes and don't give them the satisfaction of taking your money for shoes that you won't be able to wear :("
"2","My first time to visit, and I hit a GREAT sale. 4 pairs of shoes for $75, and all of the shoes are very stylish. One of the employees, Brian, was very helpful! When a shoe was a little loose, he simply added some padding and the shoe fit just right. I am glad I discovered this place, and will definitely go again. Great prices, great customer service."
"2","My best friend/roommate and I absolutely love this place. Last time we went in we were actually wearing shoes that we bought here and the salesman commented on that we were a walking advertisement for them. \n\nOverall, we both combined have 6 pairs of shoes from this place and so far we have gotten a lot of compliments. I bought my first pair here about a month plus ago and I still receive compliments on those pair. The prices are really not expensive for the quality you get. My friend got really nice brown boots here that look really classy for only $89. Anywhere else they would be at least $150. \n\nIf you have not tried this place out I would highly recommend it."
"1","This place offers a sliver of charm for those who shop/stroll along Walnut St. and want to drop in for an espresso. It has a big clear garage window which is always open when weather permits - and this allows for good people watching. Nevertheless, it still lacks some of the warmth and welcome that you find in other independent coffee shops. Although there are a lot of electrical outlets, this place may not be the best spot to study for a couple hours (esp. during weekend peak times). Tables can be scarce and it seems like the owner/staff are less than thrilled about a bunch of sweatshirt clad students detracting from the Walnut St. bistro-charm. If you still decide to hit the books, there is a semi-soundproof room in the back where some like to study, however it also serves as a \""community room\"" that is periodically reserved. Prices on coffee are decent, but the food and desserts are way over-priced and disappointing to the palate."
"1","I was a fan for years of the Coffee Tree in spite of the lack of seating due to endless working students with laptops. I changed my mind when twice in  a row when I asked for a spare paper cup to split my coffee with my wife I was told -- we dont do that. Starbucks does and is a lot friendlier. I hate to down local companies but Coffee Roasters is acting like a franchise not a local coffee shop."
"1","Coffee Tree offers a number of different places to sit - the open coffee shop with the huge garage doors or back by the fire on the couches.  The coffee is okay, nothing special.\n\nBut if you want to sit outside without being outside this is the place.  The internet is now \""free\"" for an hour so long as you buy something and the staff will readily give you a code whenever you buy something.\n\nAs some of the other reviewers have pointed out, you may find it difficult to get a seat."
"1","I like the look of this Coffee Tree Roasters location more than anything else.  If you like people watching on a nice day, try grabbing a seat near the front of the shop, when they open up the huge glass windows.  In the winter, the coveted seating is towards the back of the shop, the couches and chairs by the fireplace.  The meeting room in the back is handy, but I've found it to be really chilly in the winter--not sure how it is in other seasons.\n\nThe coffee's all right, and I feel \""meh\"" about the hot chocolate and chai.  While the baked goods in the case look tempting, I haven't been wowed.  One person I went with got a biscotti, which was rock hard--now, biscotti's supposed to be crispy, but not that hard.  When she told the baristas, they informed her that the biscotti was supposed to be that way (didn't she know any better?).  At best, I've found the service here to be civil, not friendly."
"2","i must admit that i'm shocked at the poor reviews for this coffee tree roasters location.  though i don't spend time in the store, i always grab an espresso or latte whenever i'm in shadyside.  i absolutely love their beans.  i even buy their whole beans to brew at home."
"2","i love this place!!!!!! \n it is a pretty big cafe shop,and they also have a small room for study discussions and they also have this open place,for people who would like to breathe some fresh air and see people walking outside the street.\n\n  I could actually sit outside all day sipping the amazing coffee and dunking their yummy walnut or dark chocolate biscotti .And wooo what makes me love this place more??They have amazingly cute stickers to stick it on your coffee cup.\n\n   And yes!! i do enjoy cheap thrills like ,taking a sticker which reads GOBBLE GOBBLE and sticking it on my friends forehead.hahah\ni did laugh for about 2 minutes. But sadly my friends was definitely not edible ! \n\n   A great cafe shop in an amazing location and filled with good memories.i love you coffee tree!!\n*imagines herself hugging a huge tree which bears coffee beans on it* :)\n\n-Smriti"
"2","The vanilla lattes are a little sweet, but delicious. This place is perfect when the weather is nice and they can open the garage door. It's definitely a must-visit coffee shop on Walnut."
"2","I love coffee and any place that serves it. Shadyside is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, especially on a Saturday afternoon. It's very alive and animated with people everywhere! I personally love window shopping at the Apple Store, but that's a different story. \n\nMy girlfriends and I met on Saturday for a little shopping and lunch, and while we were waiting for our one friend, we hopped into the Coffee Tree for a morning tea. They have an awesome tea selection, and I had their organic citrus green tea. The layout is great inside - a lot of tables, and outlets for the laptop users. Up one level, they have couches by a fireplace, and finally in the back they have a closed-in meeting room available for groups. Great location - great tea. It was perfect for the brisk, sunny Saturday morning walk down Walnut."
"1","This place just keeps getting worse and worse.  \n\nI've been in Pgh for a while now and honestly, I can't remember a time when I didn't go to Coffee Tree Roasters on Walnut as my go-to study/sit around/meeting place.  I loved the big garage door, the ambiance, the people watching, the free wifi...etc..etc.  The coffee was good and reasonably priced, with tea at hand if I felt like it.\n\nSince then the quality of the place and service has just plummeted.  Started with the bathrooms...rarely cleaned, rarely working.  Nowadays, if you dare to sit in the back near the bathrooms, the whole area reeks of stale urine or something.  It smells like the bathroom.  Inside, the toilets are leaky, the floors are often COVERED in water (lets hope) and paper...I partially blame the patrons for leaving these in such poor condition, but hey, management, could you possibly, i dunno...clean it?  I've gone a couple times in one day, once in the morning, and once after classes, and the bathrooms look exactly the same.  \n\nThen the service declined.  First they started making the \""you must buy something to get internet.\"" That's fine with me.  I always buy something there.  But then they started the 2hr limit...then free 2hrs, but then you have to buy something ELSE on top of whatever you bought initially...etc...etc.  Now half the time the internet doesn't work and no one on staff seems to care or know how to reset it.  They just look at you like you are lying about the internet because, hey, they saw someone using what looked to be the internet about 8hrs ago...or that's what their coworkers told them yesterday.\n\nThen the coffee also became watered down...and went up a smidge in price.  Still cheaper than SBux but its...not as quality anymore.  \n\nI still love it for the giant door into people watching in shadyside and its locale. But otherwise, it could be a lot better...because it USED to be a lot better."
"2","Coffee Tree Roasters has become a coffee shop staple for me to work and study. The Shadyside location has a clear garage like door for a window which they put up when the weather is nice (and even when a sprinkle of rain occurs) and I absolutely love that part of this place.\n\nThey also have in the back a conference room with all glass windows so if it is not reserved and the people around you are talking you can go in (though seems like it might need an air freshener and have a rug renovation). Next to the conference room is the bathroom which they do keep clean.\n\nWeekends are typically crazy filled with people so if you want a seat either come early or come late (opened until midnight!) though offer a lot more seating compared to other places in the area. Even when there is a long line, the cashiers have been helpful and have gotten me what I have bought so no complaints there.\n\nI'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means but not a fan of their hot lattes and their hot coffee is okay though do like their ice coffee, ice teas, hot teas and chai. Their sweets are fantastic to boot (rice krispies, wafers - which are 5 for $1, biscottis and cookies) though hope they will have more savory items for snacking (sometimes they have pita and sandwiches available for purchase). Probably good they have not offered more of a selection for snacks since I feel like I'm always eating and drinking in here anyway..."
"2","I dunno, I've been here enough times to review the place, but there's not really a whole lot to say.  It's a coffee shop! I never sit in and hang out, I always just stop by for a cup, and usually I go to Jitters instead ::shrug::\n\nI'd have to say that they serve you pretty quickly, though, which is good because it's always hella busy in there!  The big open storefront thing is great on a nice day.  I suppose if the Coffee Tree had a selling point, that'd be it."
"2","My go to study spot.  I've enjoyed the regular coffee, ice teas, and biscotti. Decent amount of electrical outlets which is crucial to my sad existence as a PC user.\n\nOpen until midnight everyday if I'm not mistaken which is heaven for a stressed out grad student.\n\nGreat for hitting the books while being able to take study breaks to people watch. On nice days, the whole front opens as it is a garage door offering an awesome feel.\n\nStaff has always been polite and doesn't seem to mind students hogging tables for hours upon hours. \n\nActually, as I write this review I realize this may be my favorite coffee house ever."
"1","Let's talk about the weird interaction I had with a Barista here.  I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question, right?  She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??\n\nThe only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.  Oh, sweet game of chess there dude....\n\nOh yeah, my chai was okay, Oregon Chai Mix (my third fav after a homemade mix or Intellegentsia).   Made exactly how I ordered it, extra hot, which a lot of people do not do correctly (it needs to burn my tongue, for realz).  \n\nBut for me, this is a spot I'd avoid....way too crowded!"
"1","It's another Saturday evening of salted-pretzel chocolate-chip cookies with coffee at Coffee Tree Roasters--Shadyside.  My cookie is stale, as it always is.  That said, I don't know what about today has compelled me to finally write this review, as opposed to any other day, but it has been a long time coming despite the fact that nothing about my CTR experience has changed. \n\nTo first address the cookie.  I'm going to cut CTR some slack on the cookie because I tend to attend the cafe late in the evening, so I don't know if it's day-old staleness that I'm getting at the end of every day or if it's week-old staleness that even morning caf\u00e9 go-ers experience as well.  Given the turnover rate of the baristas/sales associates at CTR, their detachment and general disinterest in their jobs, I will never have the opportunity to learn the truth about the cookies through potentially sharing a human conversation. \n\nI cannot tell you how bittersweet my afternoons are at Coffee Tree Roasters--Shadyside.  But it could be worse.  I far prefer any CTR over any Crazy Mocha.  In comparison CTR has coffee (rather than the tasteless shit Crazy Mocha serves), they have more intimately designed spaces, better furniture, and CTR's appeal is more carefully crafted to the demographic of each location.  Put simply, it's the better Pittsburgh coffee chain.\n\nEvery day that I caffeinate at CTR--Shadyside I am reminded of how impersonal chain-run coffee shops are.  The truth of the matter is that, like most people at CTR--Shadyside, I live in the neighborhood, which translates to spending 10% of my life at CTR.  Still, none of the baristas/sales associates have ever, nor likely will ever, acknowledge that they recognize me.  For some reason I expect them to remember that I get the same medium drip every time, with room for cream.  In the very least, a shallow mirroring of my acknowledgement of our everyday interaction would be nice.  The nature of our interaction is this: they ask me what they can get me, I pay them with my CC, they swipe my CC and simply put their hand to the receipt-printer while mentioning in the same repeatable tone \""and if you could sign this please....\"" which often makes me wonder whether or not they ever recognize me in the first place.  Of course I know that I need to sign the receipt.  This is right around the same time that I realize that they haven't left enough room for cream in my coffee and I ask them to pour some out.  \n\nThese baristas/sales associates are students or mid-twenties recent graduates from the nearby private schools.  They are not exactly the most present, nor interested baristas/sales associates in the world but I understand it's just a job, rather than something they love to do.   Upon closer observation each and every one of them feels a bit nervous, socially awkward and anxious to serve the next customer.  There was one barista/sales associate I liked in July, but he lasted for one month.\n\nAside from the human experience, CTR--Shadyside has a nice layout.  It's a long, narrow space and low ceiling creates a living-room feel (not to mention two living-room couch collections situated in the center of it's 60' length coffee shop facilitates great group/family conversations).  There is an office room in the back with walls of glass and a door, which pretty much seals all sound out, with the exception of the adjacent bathroom doors opening/closing which can be annoying because these bathrooms always seem to be in use (which makes sense because this caf\u00e9 seats roughly 40 people at any given time).  I can tell you from personal experience that the female bathroom is poorly ventilated and generally smells like it is poorly ventilated, especially later in the evening.\n\nBut of course, they have good internet.  When you open your browser you are prompted to accept their basic internet-use terms.  The interface then counts down for 2 hours, at which point you may return to the register to ask for an extension and they will hand you a commercial post-it with a unique password pre-printed, granting you another 2 hours.  Honestly, I haven't stayed at CTR for longer than 4 hours, but I am sure the barista/sales associate wouldn't mind giving you another additional 2 hours.\n\nPerhaps in the end the taste of stale salted-pretzel keeps bringing me back, perhaps I prefer a homemade cookie to a pre-packaged cookie.  And yes, they have a fantastic assortment of pre-packaged cookies, healthy granola-bar cakes, Ghiardelli, and 15 oz bags of chocolate covered espresso beans as well.  But still, while CTR Shadyside claims to be well-rated by City Search, it's pure sillyness.  If you want good coffee in Pittsburgh go to Espresso A Mano in Lawrenceville or Tazza D'orro in highland park/CMU campus.  CTR Shadyside is a typical Wi-fi hot spot, nothing special.  \n\nI really wish that an independent coffee shop could afford to exist on Walnut Street because I genuinely hate this place."
"2","In the summer or early fall, it's a great place to hang out as the windows are open and you can feel the nice breeze.  The service is pretty good and took my order quickly as well as serve it promptly.  The prices are competitive and the muffin was fresh.  Despite being busy, it did not feel overcrowded with their 2 levels of seating.\n\nI also ordered a bag of beans.  They had a vast selection of beans at very good quality and had no problem with a coarse grind for my french press.  Overall, a very solid place for coffee and baked goods."
"2","This was my official neighborhood coffee shop while I lived right down the road on Walnut for 3 years. It's located right in the heart of Shadyside, and while some of the patrons are typical uppity Shadyside residents, the staff are very laid back and very cool. It's a big venue for a coffee shop, with a down stairs area with beautiful exposed brick and large opening windows that are great in the summer months, and also an upstairs area with many tables, a fireplace with sofas, and even a back private room people can rent out. The coffee and pastries have always been pretty good. One complaint I would have is (I don't know if they still do this) you could only have Wifi access for two hours with the purchase of an item. I understand the need for this, but if you plan to work here for most of the day you have to keep refilling or buying other items on the menu. I usually stop in when I'm shopping around Shadyside and miss it now that I've moved out of the neighborhood.  Also a great place for meeting with friends or a casual date."
"2","Drinks: 3\nDecor: 4.5\nAmbiance: 5\nService: 3.5\nValue: 4"
"2","I have recently become a coffee shop bum (and my reviews are beginning to reflect this) but I enjoy this place. It definitely is busy (which is a good sign) but can be difficult to find a comfortable seat. The drinks are great and the staff is really friendly. \n\nTheir late hours are ideal for students or those that just run better late at night. The fireplace and quiet room are cool additions to an already pretty neat space. \n\nThe only thing I wish was a bit better was the wifi situation - luckily I was able to get a bunch done without the need for it. Definitely going to keep coming back here and enjoying the space/drinks!"
"1","OMG. Mr. Barista. Your not in Seattle. I Live Pacific Northwest.  I'm not a coffee snob I can do with it or without it. But it seemed like I was absolutely bothering the staff this morning. Check the date.  Ordered mocha and a scone.  And got a look.  I'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear. Felt like I was in someone else's hood.  Get over yourselves people.  Your in Pittsburgh."
"2","I've taken my laundry to the Laundry Factory a couple of times now.  They are always prompt and do a good job at taking care with your clothes.  The place is surprisingly clean and bright for a laundromat.\n\nAs Zoe mentioned the prices are very reasonable and you won't find a cleaner place anywhere near Shadyside.  Another plus, when I needed somethings turned around quickly they were more than willing to accommodate me, for no extra charge."
"1","i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning.  they outsource the dry cleaning and didn't really make recommendations on any of my garmets.  i've gone to cleaners before that will tell me to wash over dry clean or startch, ect.  to top it all off the place didn't have my garmets back the day they said they would.  so, i had to make another trip across town to pick them up.  where are the $1.95 per garmet dry cleaning shops in pittsburgh?  this place is out of my dry cleaning budget!"
"1","They lost 2 of my shirts and a pair of my jeans - they were also EXTREMELY rude when I tried to find my stuff and did not offer any help.\n\nThey are unreasonably expensive as well\n\nDO NOT GO HERE - THE HIGH RANKINGS ARE FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES!"
"2","This laundromat absolutely blew my mind the first time I stepped into it. Yeah, I'm kind of lame but still!\n\nThey keep the laundromat incredibly clean, notably their front loading washers. Front loaders tend to adopt a mildewy, moldy odor if the gasket is not cleaned properly. This isn't a huge problem at home but in a public laundromat it can really be a disaster. I can name a few places that have had this disgusting odor and did not appear to care. The Laundry Factory does not have this.\n\nThey also have two mini lounges with full cable TV. It's a nice reprieve to be able to sit down in a comfy chair and watch some TV while your clothes are washing or drying. They don't just stop at cable, however. They also offer free wifi.\n\nThey have HUGE front loader washers which is what I use. When our big bedspreads and blankets need a good washing, I take it to the Laundry Factory. Their big washers can even handle TWO queen bed spreads at a time and it still has enough elbow room to agitate the clothes to get them nice and clean. Their dryers also come in different sizes, their largest can handle about four loads of laundry and dry them fast.\n\nHonestly, I don't go to the laundromat often, but I'm glad this place exists for when I do. Not only are their facilities in awesome condition, but the amenities they offer while cleaning your clothes give them a huge edge over any other laundromat in Pittsburgh."
"2","as much as i would rather have a washer/dryer in my apartment, this place makes it bearable to go to a laundromat! excellent reasons to do your wash here:\n\n - the air conditioning is pumping! it's well over 90 degrees today, and frankly i wish i had more laundry so i could stay\n- free WiFi (which i'm using right now!)\n- kitschy decor (yes, it has decor!)\n- clean, working, updated machines\n- two fully loaded change machines!\n- friendly staff!\n\ni'm hooked and definitely coming back here."
"2","the staff is super friendly. I drop off laundry for my business and they do a great job. And yes, they are so much cleaner than any of the other places in Pittsburgh that I have used."
"1","The Laundry Factory is no longer the clean, friendly laundry facility in Shadyside that it used to be. Its spotless, new interior with its kind employees have been replaced by crass thugs and general filth. Its owner, Gary, enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces. ((I will attach a picture of him in his car in the handicapped spot later.))\n\nI was a longtime customer of the Laundry Factory until I bought a home 7 months ago. My dryer (Whirlpool Duet, the #1 rated on Consumer Reports!) went on the fritz this week and it's a full week till its repair date. \n\nSo I went back to my old haunt, the Laundry Factory. My, how things've changed.\n\nIn the past, I would update the firmware of the wireless router because the internet was constantly going out. The staff were friendly and always grateful and the place was kept super clean.\n\nThis time, the staff were new, loud and mean. The floors were not swept and the clientele were themselves obnoxious.\n\nI made a simple request - fulfilled dozens of times in the past - for a simple plastic bag (like a grocery bag, for my delicate on the ride home) . So they (wet) wouldn't get the (dry) laundry wet again. \n\nAs chance would have it, the owner Gary was around. He was mocking customers as I approached the desk, calling them stupid little rich kids who don't know which end is up. I asked him for a bag; he condescendingly mocked me, telling me they sold bags for 75 cents. I patiently explained that the money wasn't an issue; it's the fact those particular bags are porous and polyester. Plastic was what I needed. He wanted 75 cents for a throwaway grocery bag as well. \n\nI gently told him how often I'd fixed his router. He sneered, saying plugging and unplugging it was no big deal. I explained that I'd updated the firmware and saved him many Comcast visits. He was shocked into momentary silence. I asked if I should have billed him for the repairs. A typical neanderthal business owner, he didn't realize that his clients were kind, or even human. \n\nThe damage was done. As icing on the cake, on my way out, I noticed Gary climb into his van. He'd been there for over an hour. \n\nIn a handicapped parking space."
"2","Clean very clean present people $2.10 for shirts and I hate doing launder at a mat but if I have to then I will do it hear.  It's worth the extra buck to do it some where thats clean has WiFi a tv for the game and is right next to a bottle shop and a bar. Ok everything is stainless."
"1","If i could give this place less than one star I would.  First, the place is a mess.  Second, the washers are some of the most expensive I've found in the city.  But most important - they have NO RESTROOMS!  What kind of place sends their customers a block down the street to a coffee shop to use the restroom?  This was my first AND LAST time at this joint."
"2","Oh, laundromats. How you take me back to my days in college and grad school. Though I've been fortunate to have in-home laundry capabilities everywhere I've lived over the last several years, recently I found myself in need of professional (laundry) help when my dog puked all over our comforter and mattress pad (thanks again for that, little buddy). Our washer was too small to do the job, so off I went to the Laundry Factory.\n\nLike I said, it's been awhile since I've been to a laundromat, so I don't know what other laundromats are like these days, but wow, this one was wayyyy nicer than the ones I used to go to back in the day! It was modern, clean, bright, and had tons of well-kept machines. No dank corners where sketchy people loitered, no broken machines, no weird funky old sneaker smells. \n\nThey had several sizes of machines to choose from, ranging from average (a regular household laundry machine) to mega-capacity. I chose the \""large load\"" machine, which fit our comforter and mattress pad just fine. A load in the large capacity machine cost $6.00, which seemed a little steep, but not too bad. Other machines ranged in price from $2.75 to $10.00 (super mega capacity machine). They also have super capacity (50 lb.) dryers, which was very handy. It was $.50 for the first 5 minutes of drying time, and then $.25 for every 4 minutes after that. Again, seemed a little steep, but the dryers were very efficient -- I think it took only about 15 minutes (on low heat, no less) to dry my bulky items.\n\nThey had well-stocked change machines and a nice little lounge to wait in. I didn't see any bathrooms, so good thing I refrained from going to the beer store next door to have a cold one while I waited.\n\nThey do have a parking lot, but it's really small and packed, so you'll probably only get a spot if you're lucky. So plan to either park on the street or behind the building (I found plenty of space behind the building and wasn't ticketed or towed).\n\nAnyhow, next time I need to use a large capacity washing machine (which I hope is NEVER -- hint hint, my little doggie friend), I will not hesitate to come back here."
"2","i'm a total fan of eons. love their selection! a little pricey though."
"2","You want style?  You want selection?  You want clothes that have been respectfully honored for the wearable vintage art they are?  Go here!!!  The owner Richard is top-notch and knows his stuff inside and out.   My only regret is that I didn't have more days to visit...maybe that good thing, because honestly, I don't think I would have left the store.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd be making weekly (maybe even daily) journeys to the store.\nI'm an experienced vintage shopper and baby - it doesn't get better than this!  And the prices - very reasonable for the quality of the clothing, which is all cleaned and tenderly loved."
"2","Meticulously organized and a great selection. Definitely worth a stop."
"2","Wow! This shop is incredible. First off...I'm 29, and I know vintage thanks to great grandparents, and a grandmother who was a show girl, all of whom had excellent taste. Anyone who says this place is over priced needs their head examined! It's NOT a thrift store, so don't go in there expecting thrift store prices, that's just ignorant. Do expect amazing finds at what I consider beyond fair prices. \n\nI first went into Eons after reading some reviews. Being new to Pittsburgh, and so far disappointed with \""vintage\"" stores, Eons seemed quite promising. I found a blue velvet 3/4 length coat and fell in love...but was crushed when I saw a stain the cleaner had missed (this is NOT typical of this shop's wares, and the owners seemed equally sad to have found it.) They offered to sell it at $40, down from $60, but I just couldn't take the chance of the stain not coming out. I settled for a gorgeous bright orange crystal necklace...for the time...\n\nI was back in the area a few days ago and the coat was still haunting my dreams. I decided I'd bite the bullet and hope the stain would come out. When I walked up to the register, I was to my surprise remembered, and the coat was sold to me for $30! (Down from the already marked down \""as is\"" price of $40!) I was thrilled! And, was even more so when I took the coat home and (with a little of grandma's old tricks) got the stain out!\n\nI absolutely love this place. The selection is vast, the owners are kind, and the clothes are pristine. It's a small shop, but it has epic high ceilings and it's stuffed from top to bottom with beautiful things. For everything here, I am never ceased to be amazed by how neat and organized it is. I love it here, and will shop here always."
"2","I have walked past this store on so many occasions, but never thought to actually walk in here until today.  Being a creature of Pittsburgh I have been doing the whole neighborhood thing.  That is to pick a neighborhood, browse almost every store in that neighborhood and then rave to everyone for about a week how great that neighborhood is for shopping.  Well this week my friends I will tell you that because of Eons, Shadyside will be spewed upon all my friends and anyone that comes my way asking where they should go to shop.\n\nI must say, I hesitated at the door for a bit, mentally prepping myself to enter this store.  I hate when I walk into a store and cannot find anything I want.  So I prepped myself just in case that happened.  Once I walked in, I put myself at ease and just let myself browse and browse and browse.  For the small space that the store occupies, they sure do know how to jam pack all racks and shelves to the maximum.\n\nI was greeted almost right away as soon as I walked in the door.  Of course the obligating question once you enter a clothing store of any type is, \""Welcome, can I help you find anything?\""  Of course I did what any typical person would do stared at them and eventually replied with, \""No thank you, this is my first time in here.\""  I think I puzzled them with that response.  Then I just went where my mind guided me...which would have been to the shoes.  I found a swank pair of tan and white shoes that I couldn't take my eyes off of.  After about five minutes of me staring at them the guy asked me if I wanted to try them on, OF COURSE I wanted to try them on.  I wanted to hug them if I could.  Not only did he give me one shoe to try on, but unlike other places, allowed me to try the other shoe and yes, I did a little turn on the catwalk to make sure they were right for me.  And I will admit, I watched myself in the big mirror as I walked back and forth in front of it.\n\nI also browsed a few more racks and shelves to make sure I wasn't neglecting any other items.  Good thing I did, I found the perfect vest to compliment the shoes (and once I got home I noticed it was reversible, BONUS!).\n\nYou know you had walked into an amazing business when you see that every non-filtered review here on Yelp is above par.  I'm also glad to add another one of those reviews."
"2","Good selection, well organized, friendly staff!  \n\nOn my quest to explore Pittsburgh, I stopped by Eons and ended up trying on a few things.  I wasn't really on a quest to find anything though, but I could see myself spending hours in there shuffling through all the racks."
"2","This place defines \""vintage clothing shop\"". It's small, packed, and well organized. You must stop in here, even if you don't think you want vintage clothing. You will. The selection is amazing, and the staff could not be more helpful."
"1","I went here once when I first moved to Pittsburgh. My shirts came back poorly pressed and some had broken buttons. I was disappointed."
"1","I am not a fan of this place.  They are certainly convenient for Shadyside, and I don't think their prices are out of control.  But they do have quality issues with alterations.\n\nI didn't have any problems with the dry cleaning, but brought some pants in to get hemmed.  First time I went back to pick them up, they told me they were out to be pressed.  Not sure why it should be sent OUT to be pressed, especially since I had come a few days later than indicated on my ticket, but OK.  Second time I come back to pick up the pants, the pins were still in the fabric - NOTHING had been done to them.  So not only were they not done, someone clearly LIED to me about where they were the first time around.  Finally got them on the third try, and I insisted on a discount.  But when I brought them home, I looked at the hem job and it was low quality.  They just flipped the fabric up and sewed along the hem, rather than tucking the cut edge under and THEN hemming.  I expected better, given the price."
"1","I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well."
"1","Please do not give them business. Owen's has the worst customer service and quality of service. You are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner. First, they messed up one of our pants badly. I understand that dry cleaners cannot always clean clothes the way you want, but I have never taken clothing to a dry cleaner and have it come out WORSE than before. When I say they messed up one of our pants, they destroyed it. I went back to let them know and they didn't even say sorry or anything like that. Rather, they were extremely rude and defensive. Did I mention, that they messed up my pant!! .....and still had the audacity to be rude. Amazing.  I tried to politely (even though they messed up my pant) ask them about their dry cleaning process to find out why/how my pants came out worse and they were still rude. \n\nFor your own sake and peace of mind, do not give them business. Not only are they of poor quality, but they don't deserve your business from a customer service stand point. I would hate to know that my dollars are going to a low quality and disrespectful business. And they are not even cheap....at all."
"1","Do not use this cleaner.  Quality is poor. They ruined three shirts of mine, tore two of them and shrunk another down. Refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss. They do not stand by their mistakes."
"1","Have been waiting for +10 business shirts and suits for over 2 weeks. The manager is uncertain whether my clothes will be ready in another week or two. \n\nThe last batch of dry cleaning came back pressed with wrinkles. Had to send it back. \n\nCustomer service is poor. \n\nI would strongly recommend you not use Owen's Dry Cleaners."
"1","This place is terrible.  Customer service is sub-par.  I took 10 shirts in on a saturday.  They were supposed to be ready on the following thursday, 5 days later.  I went to pick them up on monday, NINE days later and they still weren't done.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I have a card to have 5 shirts laundered for free and i'm throwing it away."
"2","This is one of the greatest restaurants I have ever been to and I wish to god I had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really REALLY good meal I had here.  \n\nAs soon as i walked in, I felt really special, which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but I'm not kidding...I felt like one of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids...really special.  The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant.  I was mesmerized.  \n\nOur waitress was a sophisticated, demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu.\n\nWe were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...\n\nI would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me crying at the end of the meal.  Be sure to read the captions...\n\nThe bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next \""Bold look of Kohler\"" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).\n\nI might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like Pittsburgh, but quite honestly, I just need to shut up and visit her more often."
"2","Soba is Big Burrito's take on Asian fusion.  As with everything concerning Big Burrito, Soba is excellent in all departments.  It is next door to Umi (Big Burrito's sushi place) in a trendier area of Shadyside.\n\nThe space is elegant--a waterfall adorns the interior.  Lighting is dark as is the decor--as with most Big Burrito establishments.  There is plenty of space between tables and such--you can take a date here and you should.\n\nThe food is excellent.  Dishes are inventive (not your normal Asian fusion dishes here) and well presented.  The quality of the ingredients is top-notch (my tuna tar tare tasted very fresh).  As a note, tasting menus are not available--two specials seemed to offered every night.  The menu seems to change by season as well.\n\nSoba's wine and whiskey selection is extensive--10 pages for wine, 4 for whiskey.  The service is excellent, as is to be expected.  Really, everything here is great.  You should go at least once, Soba is a gem in the rough of the Pittsburgh dining scene."
"2","Been coming to this restaurant for years, before the fire that caused the entire renovation of the place you now go to.   Obviously, I like the food, good quality, a perfect serving size, and the amuse bouche is a nice touch!  The wine selection by the glass is pretty decent.  Service is always great.\n\nThe bar area is fun and definitely a place for young professionals out for a drink, to hang, and to meet others.  At night, for the late-night menu, you can even get a few selections made from their neighbors, Umi!"
"2","MMM my hubby and I went there for the first time tonight.  Its probably our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  \n\nAfter they took our coats, we were seated on the 2nd teir looking across to the waterfall wall... We were there a lil early for dinner (530ish) So we were theonly ones upstairs, it was really nice... and quiet.  Service was wonderful and relaxed. \n\nFirst, ordered the corn chowder, and the lobster maki for starters. I'm VERY picky about sushi, hubby loves it, and he can rarely get me to eat it.  It was delcious!!  I'm actually craving more now that I'm thinking about it.  \n\nThe corn chowder was also very tastey... but after 3 or 4 bites you're mouth needs some time to cool down!! Its got some kick, but a good kick :)  Ohh, I almost forgot the complimentary appetizer that the chef sent out... I wasn't really listening to her explain it, but it was some sort of delcious hummus on a truffle infused chip... AMAZING.  They should put iton the menu :)  \n\nFor entrees, I got the pad thai and hubby got the filet.  Both were really good, the filet especially.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.  Hubby gobbled down the whole thing...  but i had to box up most of my pad thai... I think the sushi and the corn chowder filled me up... ANDi wanted to save room for a dessert.\n\nOMG.  We shared the frozen cashew terrine.  Orgasmic.  \n\nThis will be our new regular place, i think :)"
"2","THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Ahh, Soba. If only all Pittsburgh restaurants could be like you, the world would be a better place."
"2","Only went there once -- it's nice, but not so rave-worthy as other reviews might imply except in comparison to the other offerings in Pittsburgh. Food was good but IIRC, the portions are small -- you end up spending a lot of money in order to feel moderately full. Drinks are good."
"2","Atmosphere is very nice - quiet without feeling like a library, nice lighting, decent and eclectic music mix.  Service was excellent.  The clientele was mixed on Friday night - a couple with a child, two couples double-dating, people just getting drinks, etc.\n\nOnto the food.  The Pacific Rim drink was fruity and not too strong, and also reasonably priced.  The crispy tofu appetizer is awesome.  If I lived closer, I would want it all the time.  The high crispiness level means it was probably deep fried, but it's so yummy I didn't even care.\nSpicy cucumber raita (amuse bouche) with flatbread was also delicious.  I kind of want a jar of it at home to put on sandwiches or something.\nAs far as entrees, boyfriend had the beef brisket which he said was excellent and very tender.  I had the citrus tofu curry, which was just ok.  If I were a chef, I would have balanced out the very sweet citrus sauce with a little soy sauce or something savory.  The portions were more than big enough.\nAnd for dessert, we had the Vietnamese coffee creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was beyond delicious.\n\nI generally enjoyed the meal, but would appreciate maybe one more vegetarian entree to give diners a choice.  Also, a head's up: the adjoining parking lot is small, so if you have a reservation or are meeting people, make sure you allow time to find alternative parking if the lot is full."
"1","I don't see the big deal about Soba Lounge. I thought the food was only okay, and I didn't like all of the flavors overpowering each other. The ambience is really nice, and the servers are friendly, but the food was just alright for me."
"2","First a warning, the parking lot will most likely be full, because it's not just for Soba. See a parking space on the street? Take it.\n\nSoba is a beautiful restaurant and lives up to the Big restaurant group expectations of unique flavors. The sushi is great, but if it was anything less than great I'd be worried about Soba. The grilled salmon was cooked perfectly with a wonderful coconut Thai sauce. The staff is very courteous, but I had a creeping feeling they were all \""egh a bunch of 22 year olds just walked in and they don't belong here.\""\n\nWe'll have to come back for drinks and dessert one day."
"2","Finally went to this restaurant, now I understand the hype!  I loved what I had ordered.  The Thai corn chowder is awesome -so flavorful.  The flat bread with hummus - delicious (the hummus had a citrus taste to it).  The avocado maki roll was also great.  Service was excellent.  We sat outside on the balcony - beautiful and comfortable."
"2","I was recommended this restaurant by a friend a year ago and I loved it when I first went. It is dimly lit and has a very romantic ambiance. The seared tuna, made medium-rare, was warm and crunchy on the outside due to the sesame encrusted skin but still retained a nice, raw non-fishy tuna taste on the inside. The drinks are also fairly priced. Especially a year ago, if I remember correctly, it was around ~$65 for Moet Champagne which was very cheap so we ended up getting two which I guess helped the night go by easier. The lounge got busier and more vibrant as our Friday night went on at Soba Lounge. If I reviewed it last year, I would've given this restaurant five stars.\n\nImpressed with my experience the first time, I went back again last Wednesday night. I still made a reservation on opentable but it was completely unnecessary since the restaurant was pretty empty. If that's the case I recommend you asking to be seated by the waterfall on the first floor. A bottle of Moet went up to $87 so I decided not to get it this time and moved straight to the food.\n\nI began the meal this time with calamari, followed by the tuna again with the bronzini (sea bass) for myself and ended the meal with a light honeycrisp apple pudding cake dessert. I'm not quite sure what the sauce was for the calamari but it didn't go quite well with the oversized fried squid. They were not bite-sized and I've never had to cut calamari before. Even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, I was surprised the chef was still able to undercook the ginger rice accommodating the Tuna dish to an inedible level. The waiter apologized and don't get me wrong, there was great service, but I still ended up paying full fare for half a meal. For that I had to drop the restaurant down one star.\n\nThere's a parking lot available right next to the restaurant but spaces are limited. Street parking around the neighborhood shouldn't be too hard to find too."
"2","There have only been two superb fusion restaurants that I have been to in the world. There have been quite a few that were average and some that down right stunk. The problem with most fusion places that they rely on the principal that the sum will equal more than the parts and therefore, the parts do not have to be that good to begin with. Unfortunately Soba falls in that category.\n\nFor example the corn fritters we had, if you tried the fritters on their own they were barely passable, greasy, falling apart and not much flavor - a virtual fritter failure, however you wrap that mess in the bibb lettuce, put on a basil leaf and dip it in the sauce chili-soy sauce and all of a sudden it becomes a tasty little snack. But I still have to ask would this dish not be better if ALL the components were excellent? \n\nThe Thai corn chowder tasted good, but had a funny mouth appeal, grainy and lumpy at the same time and didn't look appetizing brownish yellow. We eat with our eyes, nose, taste and tactile feel so while this tasted good it didn't do so well on the other requirements.\n\nThe mushroom and spinach dumplings were actually very blah, relying on the red pepper dipping sauce for their flavor. However the chopped salad was excellent, so all is not dismal at Soba.\n\nI could go on but you get the idea. The place is expensive for what you get, they should pay more attention to the parts, master making them correctly before you try fusing it into another cuisine to cover up your mistakes. Overall most people are not as picky as I am, we tried, it was good with some problems, problems that should not have been there at their price point.\n\n3.5 stars"
"2","Over the past 4 years or so, my rating for Soba has regularly swung between 3-4 stars. Because my experiences during recent visits have been positive, I am hoping that the 4 stars will stick this time.\n\nOne of Soba's consistent strengths is its ambiance. It offers a swank, contemporary atmosphere (and, unsurprisingly, with an Asian feel). The lighting is soft and pleasing -- great for romantic dinners, but still appropriate for business meals as well. \n\nThe menu also reflects a contemporary but Asian influenced theme. The dishes are a little less innovative than Tamari's, but they are generally well thought-out and well prepared. I especially recommend the beef short ribs (strong and complex flavors) and the fillet mignon (super tender and juicy). The kitchen sometimes seem to have temperature control problems. I have had disappointing seared tunas (over done) and on a recent visit, my \""medium rare\"" fillet would probably be considered \""very rare\"" by most restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe dessert is overpriced, but I have a special soft spot for the perennial chocolate maki."
"2","This is a good restaurant, one of the best Big Burrito spots... love the small plates and the idea of being able to grab a drink at some small bites in the bar. The pork dumplings and the the vinegar sauce... to die for!!!  They have a nice happy hour M-F as well.  Good cocktails.\n\nI think many entrees are overpriced, but they are good.  But $24 for a chicken ramen dish... I still get it because it's excellent, but even restaurants in San Francisco and NYC don't charge this much for such a dish.  The Bronzini dish is always excellent and they try to add a few other tasty specials in from time to time... but in my opinion the menu doesn't change too often.  It's a good place to go when you want to get exactly what you want... meaning, whatever you had on the menu last time will probably still be on the menu."
"2","I have always bee a fan of the big burrito restaurants. My boyfriend and i have been there 4 times and each time it has been amazing. the decor is excellent and its dark and even romantic. they also have a hip bar with couches and they open it up during the summer\nDuring certain holidays they have the chefs tasting  menu which has 4 courses. My boyfriend got that during their thanksgiving special and he LOVED IT!!!!! \n I have gotten the spinach and mushroom dumplings as a starter  a couple of times and they were amazing the pepper dipping sauce was soo delicious. for my entree i got the red curry tofu and the flavors were amazing. it was very filling and all the vegetables blended well. for desert i got the caramel bomb and it was DELISH!!!! \nI ve had the vegetarian pad thai on a different occasion and that was pretty amazing too. They dont have too many vegetarian options i kind of wish they did.  \nThey have a great wine and cocktail selection too. \nFor non vegetarians the chefs tasting options they have every once in a while are amazing!!"
"1","So underwhelming. I've been here a few times and have always been disappointed. Last night the service was especially lackluster. And the kitchen closed and 10, so no snacks for us later in the evening . They do make a good French Martini though."
"2","This was the last stop on the \""Brother Visits Ne'er Do Well Kid Sister and Treats Her to Meals\"" tour.\n\nWe started with the Indonesian corn fritter wraps, which were delicious with the chili-soy dipping sauce.  The corn fritters should have either been a little smaller or the lettuce leaves a little bigger, however, because the combo to unwieldy to roll up and eat.  The seaweed salad was good, too.\n\nMy entree was the autumn vegetables and rice cake noodles--which I only realized was very similar to a pasta dish at Casbah after I took my first bite.  The dish at Casbah: maccheretto with white beans, wild mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, cheese and walnuts.  Soba's version: rice cake noodles with wild mushrooms, butternut squash, green beans, arugula and sunflower seed pesto.  The types of vegetables in Casbah and Soba's versions differ, but the pestos taste pretty much the same.  Rice cake noodles don't really soak up liquid, though, so Soba's version was drowning in sauce.  I probably would have enjoyed another entree more.\n\nI guess I should have read the menu description more carefully, but didn't think Asian fusion (Soba) and Mediterranean (Casbah) were anything alike, so I didn't expect to get the same dish at both restaurants.\n\nFor dessert, we split the five spice apple tart with honey creme fraiche and crispy yam.  The tart was more honey creme fraiche with some apple bits on top; it was tasty but I would have liked more apple.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere on a Sunday night, and our server was pleasant but didn't hover.  The food's delicious--just order carefully if you've dined at another Big Burrito restaurant not too long ago, to avoid getting a similar dish."
"2","I can't stress how incredible the Big Burrito group is. They deserve prizes.\n\nI came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival, and was pleased to order and eat the price-fixed ($35) four-course meal they offered. Delicious pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, duck confit, duck breast, noodles, beef and rice, fresh vegetables, and an incredible dessert of cake with a hint of banana (and a vanilla wafer).\n\nThe lights were turned low, there was a wall with running water streaming down from the top, and there was some contemporary playlist in the background playing all of your NPR favorites (David Gray, Radiohead). As an added bonus, the paper towels in the bathroom were EXCELLENT--I felt so guilty wiping my hands on them and throwing them away.\n\nThe menu is a bit pricey, but I don't think I'm experienced enough to judge its price vs. the food...I'm just a pretty broke college student who spends all of his expendable income on nice places like Soba."
"1","So the majority of my food was good here, appetizer (King Edward Mussels), dessert (sorbet) but the main course I ordered: soba noodle was horrible. It was way to salty which overwhelmed all other flavours.  Normally I would give a place a second chance, but this is soba we are talking about the namesake of the restaurant.  For this price, I would expect excellent food and great atmosphere which this place has failed to deliver."
"2","If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check out Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee liqueur. \n\nBy far the best espresso martini in the city!\n\nThey also have an excellent food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  They have happy hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great crowd!\n\nSoba is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent restaurants!"
"2","Get a martini\nOr anything else they have\nThis place is heaven\n\n\n(b)"
"1","I give this place an OKAY because I've had mixed experiences. The first time I went it was okay, but was very forgettable.\n\nThe last time I went, we were seated outside on the balcony, and the outdoor heating was nice, our waiter was polite and well spoken. The only thing was that our food took... forever... to come. When we asked about the status of our order, the food came right away.\n\nIn terms of food, they have a pretty good selection, but... once again forgettable. It's a nice and casual place to go but don't expect more."
"2","Last night was the first time I went to Soba and I LOVED it! My friends and I got some tables in the lounge area and it was the perfect setting for a quiet Saturday night catching up with friends. The whole place has such a great vibe, the service was awesome, and the drinks were dee-lish! I can't wait to go back and have dinner there."
"2","Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???\n\nWell, your good citizens, that's who.  Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks to the brilliant hostess at our B&B who told us Soba was her favorite spot within walking distance.  I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  Our meal at Soba was one of the finest, most delicious, and wholly satisfying that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no less, in that prestigious category...).\n\nThe subtle lighting and modern d\u00e9cor of the joint is coolly lovely, setting the mood right away for a relaxed dining experience.  Attentive, professional service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy to make recommendations.  Husband and I started out with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy lemon ponzu.  The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly sour foil.  We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable I've ever had.\n\nFor entr\u00e9es, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, and peanuts.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded tenfold for doing so.  The scallops had a perfect sear, the soba was fat and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  And the tuna was seared expertly, still gorgeously garnet and cool in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful rice.  I don't think either of us wanted that meal to end.  And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  Soba FTW.\n\nPittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me want to pull up stakes and move in with you."
"2","My boyfriend took me out to dinner at Soba Lounge for my birthday last week!  We had reservations for 7 pm on a Thursday evening, and had an absolute hell of a time parking!  How does anybody live in this neighborhood?  It's maddening.  The lot next to Soba was full, and there's only one way in/out, so it was pretty much impossible to get out of after we realized it was full - don't even bother, just drive around until you find street parking somewhere.\n\nOur disgruntled-ness quickly wore off when we stepped inside.  Dimly lit, sleekly decorated, and filled with a sense of Zen and calm, my boyfriend noted that it reminded him of the restaurants in Chicago.  High praise!  We followed our server upstairs, past a peaceful wall-waterfall, and to our elegant table.  There was a medium-size crowd at Soba that night, consisting oddly of mostly older people and businessmen - not many twenty somethings in sight!  That was a bit surprising, but fortunately the noise level was low, giving Soba a feeling of intimacy - great for a date!\n\nOur server was friendly, perky, and quick to recommend her favorite dishes.  She was the kind of server who, if you wanted her to, would stop at your table to chat for a few minutes, but if you'd rather she was unobtrusive and quick, she could do that too.  I started with a cocktail, the Gin Blossom, and my boyfriend got something with Drambuie that isn't on the menu anymore.  I LOVED mine - it was purple!  It was very floral and sweet, perfect for me.  Just strong enough too - I sipped it throughout the whole meal.\n\nWe started with the grilled baby octopus, which actually was great!  The texture was meatier than we expected - I think we anticipated the rubbery, chewiness of calamari.  But it was great!  The legs (tentacles?) were lined with grill marks and the meat had a salty, savory taste.  And the aioli that lined the plate?  Creamy and delicious.  Next, we enjoyed the lobster maki with pistachios and mango - it was delicious and fresh, presented very simply.  A bit pricey for what you get, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.\n\nFor my entree, I had the sea scallops with BBQ pork, and it was pretty wonderful.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY.  The pork underneath was flavorful and tender - a bit salty, but at least it wasn't bland!  The rice cake noodles were deliciously glutinous and chewy.  It was a good size portion as well - I couldn't quite finish it after the two appetizers we shared, so I had to take a bit home. Boyfriend got the pad thai, and I found it a little disappointing in that it was indistinguishable from takeout pad thai.  Good takeout, but still - it didn't seem heightened in any way.  Which is fine, I guess, but for $19?  Whoa.  No.  He was satisfied with it, but I was disappointed since it was a special occasion and his meal definitely wasn't of birthday caliber.  At least it was my birthday and not his!\n\nI think generally the food here is very good, and the atmosphere is upscale and intimate.  I'd stick with the dishes that are complex and unique.  Don't go here and get the pad thai.  But you won't be disappointed by the exotic offerings!"
"1","I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar, the duck was mediocre.  I guess I'm used to really good food from foodie towns.  If I wanted mediocre food, I would go to fridays or olive garden-- was it comparable?  Yes, for quality of food.  The price, obviously, was much more.  This fake fusion place would have gone out of business, regardless of price, if it had to compete with the likes of Slanted Door or was located in a city with good food.  If this is representative of the best Pittburgh has to offer, then take the money you would have spent here and reinvest it in a trip to SF or NYC and eat well for a week. How sad is that?  Don't go here... you pay $30 for an entree, $10 for an appetizer, and $15 for a mediocre wine.  Not worth it..."
"2","Soba delivered again! One of the perks of being on the Big Burrito mailing list is the postcard they send every year at your birthday time for a free entree. I like to celebrate my birthday with some good food in the company of friends, so I usually select a restaurant and invite a few folks to join me. Tuesday night eight of us met at Soba for what turned out to be a truly lovely evening. \n\nWe had great service from go. The staff is very professional, yet willing to engage. We were seated on the top level, which was quite nice because it was quiet and there were only a few other tables aside from ours. \n\nThe roasted beet salad ($10) was a nice start. Golden and red beets were thinly sliced and piled with arugula, cortland apples, a very pretty light pink radish with green skin, cashews, and dressed with ginger vinaigrette. Others around the table enjoyed the chopped salad, tuna tartar, spicy tuna maki, and the calamari. There were no complaints and many a plate circumnavigated the table. Several of the group commented that the calamari were particularly good.\n\nThere are currently three veg options on the menu, and it was a hard choice:\n\n* red curry tofu: wild mushrooms, yellow wax beans, yu choy, fried cauliflower, carrots, chickpeas, basil, steamed jasmine rice ($17)\n* autumn vegetable and rice cake: butternut squash, chanterelles, apples, spinach, fermented black beans, miso butter, pine nuts ($17)\n* spicy pumpkin and basil noodles: shiitake, baby bok choy, peanuts, fried egg ($17)\n\nI finally chose the noodles with the spicy pumpkin and basil sauce. The dish was pleasantly spicy and I liked the addition of the egg. I would have liked the bok choy to be cut a little smaller and the shitakes cut a little bigger, but these are very small complaints about an otherwise very enjoyable dish.\n\nMy mother when with the autumn vegetables and rice cakes, which really weren't \""cakes\"" at all, but more like small balls (about the size of a gnocci) made out of rice noodles. It was \""too spicy\"" for her, but I really can't tell you what she meant because it is not spicy at all. It had a bit of a smoky rustic flavor and no spiciness whatsoever. All I know is that the rest of her dish is now in my fridge which I will be enjoying later. \n\nDessert started out as a hard sell to my dining companions, but I had saved room--this was my birthday dinner after all! What's a birthday dinner without \""cake\""!?! I went with the chocolate maki: dark chocolate mousse wrapped in a  chocolate pistachio crepe and sliced to looked like a maki roll. A small pile of pistachio cream sat next to it looking like wasabi and the \""pickled ginger\"" was really thing slices of cantaloupe. A small pot of chocolate sauce mimicked soy for dipping. T'was rich and fine, however, being the ginger fiend that I am, I really wished they had used real pickled ginger!\n\nOthers shared the chocolate pretzel stack, consisting of wonton 'pretzel' chips, malted milk chocolate cream, miso caramel, and a kinako truffle. My spoon may have found it's way into that pile up and I was impressed. the \""pretzel\"" was really tasty and the malted chocolate cream complemented it well. My mother and I both agreed that the miso caramel was amazing, and while mom's concept of \""spicy\"" may be questionable, her judgment of things caramel is not. I also heard no complaints about the black & white ice cream sandwich (dark chocolate cookies, white chocolate cheesecake ice cream, peppermint sabayon, pomegranate molasses), though it sounds like too much for me. \n\nSoba has consistently delivered a solid menu and fine service over the years. Once on the cutting edge of Pittsburgh's nascent culinary scene, they're now part of the old vanguard, but there's nothing stale about the place. Adventurous vegetarians and omnivores will all find something to delight the palate, though I can't guarantee your 70 year old mom will fare as well."
"2","I'd prob give Soba 3.5 stars if I could. We didn't want to drive in the snow so walked over to Soba on a Friday night and actually made reservations just an hour before (we prob won't get away with that on a non-stormy night). After a blast of warm air I was welcomed into this dark, cozy and seductive venue. We were led up to the top level and settled in. I ordered a Sapporo, calamari and tuna. Beer always hits the spot for me. Calamari was delicious with a nice mayo sauce with a squirt of lime. The tuna was tender! My butter knife cut into it so easily. The side of kimchi was just okay and the abundance of hot sauce sauce was to much for me. Fried rice went well with everything and balanced the tuna and sauce out. We then ordered the coconut cashew brownie which was delicious too as suggested by the waitress. The portions were large imho and while the service was fantastic I just thought the food was priced a tad high for what was offered. Seems like Soba would be nice for a special occasion or just to have a nice dinner though."
"2","Awesome service, food very good, but a tad salty for my taste. Great ambiance!"
"1","Dear Pittsburgh, we are foodies from Boston.  The wonderful thing about living in a city like Boston is that there are few chain restaurants, but infinite amounts of local-owned restaurants with hip atmosphere and delicious food made with fresh ingredients and a whole lotta passion.  I understand you're hard up, but this place made your list of top 25 restaurants in the city?  Seriously?  The decor looked much like many homes in the suburbs outside your city-a little bit o' this and a little bit o' that, but that is beside the point.  Swarmy waiters you have to flag down for service (and by the way, the locals were having to do it too) is not charming or cool.  It's unacceptable.  Especially when a restaurant has the audacity to charge what this place was for a crappy meal.  And I'm telling you, other than the Thai corn chowder, this food was barely edible.  What with all the Kings and Eat-n-Parks you may not know this, but trust me, a visitor from the land of delicious, this is just gross.  And to pay anywhere over $100 for gross (or even anywhere edging up to $100) is just a slap in the face.  It's time for Pittsburgh to get standards that are above ground.  A restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top 25."
"2","What a lovely, intimate, upscale restaurant! A nice surprise by my boo on a Wednesday night was going to Soba for dinner. We didn't have reservations but there was some seating available and we opted to sit outside since the weather was gorgeous.  I have never been here before and was really impressed with the decor! The outside seating area was my favorite part of the whole dining experience. Comfortable chairs, lights strung across the ceiling, the most pleasant breeze and a view of the sky (which at the time was a mix of pinks and reds). \n\nBoo and I split an appetizer (the mushroom, spinach dumplings) and the pad thai entree. Both were fantastic as was the service. Love it!"
"2","Went here for my husband's birthday and they have a very nice outdoor seating area. I wasn't a huge fan but my husband loved it and compared it to being on the same scale as Eleven so that's why it gets a 4 star rating. \n\nWe ordered the korean barbeque ribs $12) which fell off the bone and the calamari with chilies, toasted garlic, mint and an uni emulsion ($9). \n\nMy husband had the seared rare tuna - sesame crust, korean bbq, kim chi, cucumber-red onion  salad, ginger fried rice and peanuts ($34) which he loved. I had the spicy basil noodles with broccoli, onion, button mushrooms, baby bok choy, orange peel, sesame seeds and fried egg ($17). I ordered it spicy but found it to have a strange taste. \n\nFor dessert we had the frozen cashew terrine which had chocolate ganahce, mango-rasberry coulis and candied cashews for $8."
"2","I recently visited Soba this past weekend on a trip to Pittsburgh and I have been dying to return ever since. I wish I could get it shipped here to NJ! The food was definitely some of the best food I have ever had. The drinks were all very interesting as well. Very tasty! We ordered an array of small plates to sample various different things. Each one was better than the next. The spicy tuna maki roll was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The tempura green beans were so delicious too! We sampled everything from soup to salad and Korean BBQ ribs. Everything delicious! We even left room for dessert which was equally amazing. My friend had the sesame ice cream with salted caramel. It sounded strange to me at first but it was so delicious. I had the chocolate make which was so beautifully prepared and delectable although extremely rich with the dark chocolate. Definitely something to share because of the richness, I was only able to eat a few bites. My other friend got the pandan leaf panna cotta. After reading it on the menu, I didn't think it sounded like something I would like. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. It was amazing! I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh to visit Soba again!"
"2","I have dined at Soba more times than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh; it is my favorite! The dishes are original and creative, not like anything one can find elsewhere. I don't like tofu so much, but their tofu appetizer is fantastic - and is a large portion for a moderate cost. The chopped salad is worthy of my daily cravings. They usually have two vegetarian entrees, one or both of which can be made vegan. For a long while they had an awesome rice cake dish that I could not resist - it was a take on pesto with neato chewy rice cake noodle things and a seasonal mix of veggies and mushrooms. I do miss that one. But lately I've been getting the thakkali curry, which is pretty good too, with an interesting take on mango pickle (spicy!) and sadly, it comes with the best paratha in town. \n\nOnce I had a bad experience with the rice cake dish - it came out all wrong. I was unable to complain at the table due to my company...but I emailed the manager because I wanted them to know that somebody in the kitchen didn't seem to be gettin' it. I also took that opportunity of contact to ask for a recipe for some to-die-for brussels sprouts they used to have on their sides menu that were no longer available. The response was above and beyond what I could have expected. Everything was made up for and then some. And they apparently didn't have the recipe I requested on record, but gave me a general run down of how to make it from memory; now I make them at home according to Soba's instructions every time!\n\nThe drinks! Excellent. Some of my favorites are The Metamorphosis (no longer on menu, but I think you can still get it), Offer You Can't Refuse, The Dirty Pickle, La Pinta and Beauty Mark...They also have a nice selection of Sake, which is rare in Pittsburgh, however is is expensive to buy here. \n\nThe atmosphere is not really my style, but it passes as a cool calm romantic space. I do get sick of hearing the same music every time I go, but there are some great songs in the mix. The service is hit or miss, and some of the servers come off as scripted (probably new). Our last server was really slow about checking on us and drinks took a long time (though it wasn't busy). And as with most Big Burrito restaurants, I don't like that there are separate food runners from servers, because it makes it confusing and more time consuming to ask for things. I prefer the bar seating and service, usually. \n\nAll in all, I think Soba is Pittsburgh's best place to eat and drink."
"1","I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok, a little mushy but flavorful.  I wish I could remember the other thing, but it was better.  \n\nThe kicker was when I ordered a glass of Laphroaig.  When the bill comes, it is 75 dollars.  Apparently the only Laphroaig they have is 30 years old and no longer being produced.  And is 50 dollars a glass.  Drinking Scotch in Pittsburgh has been fun so far."
"1","I've been to Soba Lounge before, three times before actually, and all three times I had a good meal, but my last visit was so unfortunately and unequivocally terrible that it felt necessary to share the details of our meal. \n\nFor appetizer, we had the kimchi pancakes, which were not fully cooked. They were doughy and sticky, and when we informed out waiter, he agreed with us that it was not fully cooked, but made no move to return the dish to the kitchen until we requested that it be at the very least warmed up to a degree in which it was actually edible. \n\nI had the sea bass, which was mediocre and somehow different from the other wonderful times I had ordered this delightful dish - it lacked the explosively delicious flavors. The curry that was ordered was the worst - completely and wholly NOT recommended. The rice was tough (probably not fully cooked once again), and the spices were arbitrary to the chicken itself, as though they were thrown in after the chicken was already cooked. \n\nGiven the price of Soba dishes, the bill certainly took a plunge into our wallets, but sadly with no degree of satisfaction for our taste buds or stomachs."
"2","I was pretty excited to try Soba Lounge for the first time - as a fan of the Big Burrito Group, I couldn't pass on the opportunity. As soon as we entered we were asked if we wanted to sit at a table on the right, or at the bar. If want a lounge experience, I highly suggest going to the bar which has couches as well as bar seats (better for groups), if you want an intimate conversation (2-4 people), I suggest being seated to the right.\n\nFood: We ordered the crispy tofu and mushroom & spinach dumplings for appetizers, the grilled salmon and spicy basil noodles for entrees, and shared the chocolate maki for dessert.\n\nCrispy Tofu: Must eat for vegetarians or meat eaters. Cooked perfectly, with a tangy sauce\n\nMushroom & spinach dumplings: a little smaller than expected, but the red pepper dipping sauce did it in for us. The combination of flavors was great.\n\nSpicy basil noodles: Seems pretty conventional to order here, but the waitress said that it was a \""signature dish.\"" Pretty standard if you ask me, but nothing to complain about.\n\nChocolate Maki: We were excited for this, but unfortunately a tad disappointed. The pistachio cream and nuts were a great touch for the mousse, but the pistachio crepe had an awkward, rubbery taste to it.\n\nDrinks: The management and staff have differing opinions on weather or not you can bring a drink (from the bar) to your table. To clarify: YOU CAN. Go ahead and order a drink at the bar (very good cocktails/martinis) and walk over to your table. If you're a gin drinker, I highly recommend the Bee Keeper (my favorite) and Gin Blossom. The bartenders aren't shy with alcohol, so keep that in mind.\n\nAtmosphere & Service: The waitress was super helpful, and the atmosphere provided a good medium for a great conversation. Overall, great restaurant, but a little on the pricier side."
"2","Soba is usually my pick to use my free entree coupon from the Big Burrito restaurant group and there's a reason I keep going back. It's fantastic! It's a bit pricey, but not stuffy or pretentious at all. Their food menu changes daily and takes advantage of local and seasonal ingredients, but if they ever get rid of the Chocolate Pretzel Stack desert, they might have a mutiny on their hands! Their recent remodel really opened up the space, yet it still feels very cozy. The servers are always friendly and attentive and I've never had a bad experience here. Definitely a great \""special occasion\"" or romantic restaurant."
"2","Excellent food. They did a great job with the renovation- the place is swank!"
"2","Soba is great! The food is delicious, and sometimes (positively) surprising. For example, their mashed potatoes have an asian twist to them and are a little bit spicy! I like the atmosphere, interior and the service has always been great."
"1","Went to Soba to celebrate my sons birthday. Quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price. We have eaten there several times in the past but not sure that we will be going back anytime soon."
"1","My boyfriend and I went here for a nice birthday dinner. I thought it would have mire Japanese options on the menu being named soba.\n\n I ordered the black truffle-potato samosa which was not bad. \n\nI also had the chopped salad which I suprisingly really enjoyed despite it being iceburgh lettuce which is definitely not what I use for a good salad. I wish they didn't put fried batter all over it though. \n\nLast I had the vegetarian curry dish, the only vegetarian main I found. It was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice! No delicious fragrant jasmine rice....Also deep fried the Naan, didn't enjoy that. The potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall. \n\nWe were put at a table in the very corner of the third floor and all I had to stare at was a wall and an ugly floating tv hutch. It was very cold.\n\nWe were the first people in the restaurant but took FOREVER to get served. Everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor. \n\nNeedless to say I was extremely disappointed. I heard umi is also one of their restaurants and I loved it so I thought this one may have been just as good. It was not enjoyable. \n\nAlso the valet took FOREVER though it's a tiny parking lot right outside the front door and the booth was freezing despite a heater hanging way too high and no door. Heat rises....I thought most people knew this."
"2","The crab meat corn-chowder appetizer is the finest appetizer I have ever had in my life. I have been to most of the great restaurants in New York City over the past 30 years, and that statement stands.\n\nJust fabulous."
"2","Soba had become one of our regular spots for big family dinners. Most recently we came for my sisters birthday. I was able to get reservations for 7 at the last minute for Saturday night. We had a long table next to the waterfall on the first floor. It was a high top so it wasn't the most comfortable but for a last minute reservation it worked.\n\nWe started with the calamari which was delicious and then dived right into entrees. I had what I always get- the seared tuna. It's crusted with sesame seeds and comes with rice, BBQ sauce, Kim chee, and pickled vegetable. It's so delicious I never get anything else. I had bits of my moms duck which was also delicious and the boyfriends sea bass was amaze! \n\nWe did not stay for dessert at this visit but in the past I have enjoyed the ice cream with cashew dessert. Soba is really so good. And it looks to beautiful."
"2","Food is very good, not outstanding and they are  pretentious. They seem to be very New York like in terms of seating trendy looking people in the front and parking the Bentley's ou front with lots of orange cones. \n\nOne of the six of us got the wrong dish, but she ate it. Turns out to have been the best dish."
"1","We have been regulars at Soba for years, sharing a few appetizers at the bar-lounge on a quiet evening and enjoying the food. Last night was different. For the very first time the food was awful.  A scallion pancake replaced the kimchee pancake. The chef, who we learned was new, obviously had no idea that a pancake is the glue that holds a tasty morsel together. This was pure glue, tasteless and sticky. Where was the content, the taste, the flavor? The lump-crab egg roll was worthy of a corner take-out Chinese eatery, oily mostly. A pulled pork appetizer was passable, nowhere near the dish it replaced. find a new chef quickly.\nJohn E. Raffie."
"1","Food ordered:\n\nDrinks - Rhubarb Fizz, Flying Dog Porter\nAppetizers - Potstickers and Lettuce Wraps\nEntrees - Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and Vietnamese Beef Noodles\n\nFor $12, the Rhubarb FIzz was underwhelming, over-iced, overly bittered. Flying Dog Porter is a great beer. The Potstickers were ok, but tiny, while the Lettuce Wraps were the star of the entire dinner. Vietnamese Beef Noodles were bland and flavorless. The menu lists them as including jalapeno, but there was no heat whatsoever. As for the Bi Bim Bap, I've had this a few times at Korean restaurants, and it was very... different. They essentially took the appetizers and side dishes and tossed them in the pot. The kim chi and pickled shiitake just didn't belong in the dish, and brought a very off flavor to the entire things. It took a full dousing of the goju jang for the dish to be eatable. Very very disappointing.\n\nService was ok. They asked how the meal was too many times, yet after 15 minutes I had to flag down a waiter just for them to take my card so we could pay and leave.\n\nIt was my wife's birthday, and we took advantage of Big Burrito's GREAT free entree promotion, but even with $23 worth of Vietnamese Beef Noodles taken off the check, I still felt completely ripped off paying $80 for the rest of the meal and a tip. I'd much rather go to Noodlehead and pay $20 for a much better meal next time."
"2","I'm the first person to stick my nose up at Asian fusion, but hot dang, I had a wonderful meal here. \n\nHamachi sashimi appetizer - Delectable! Raw fish paired with avocado and an interesting garlic sauce for a bit of salt. Yum yum yum. \n\nKorean barbecue ribs - Fall off the bone. Unbelievably tender. \n\nSeared rare tuna - Almost 2 inches thick, and totally rare on the inside, with a crust of sesame seeds. Brilliant idea. Kimchi on the side for a flavor punch, and ginger fried rice was tasty too. \n\nAmbiance was contemporary, intimate, and cozy. Dark lighting sets the mood for a date, but I came here with family and still loved it. Upstairs patio was a bit muggy in the summer, but has nice views."
"1","Food was okay. Service okay. A bit expensive for the quality of food served. Thai corn soup jumbo crab??? Good lucking finding a piece of crab meat.  Pad Thai at a fusion place? Not good at all...Better go to a real thai restaurant for pad Thai. Tandoori Salmon was average. I still don't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm.  A cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda?  Why weren't their any ice in the glass? Who drinks sodas at room temperature. This restaurant maybe was trying to be too fancy and forgot the basics of ICE.  Maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas. Overall it is okay, but not justified by the price."
"2","Had the famous \""Birthday Coupon\"" and decided to make it worth the free entree. This place has been on my list for a while, and I was finally able to convince my husband make the trip for date night. \n\nThe only seating available without a reservation was at the bar, which is never a problem for us. We were two of the only three people there, and it was really quiet, so perfect!\n\nWe were greeted by the bartender who was very knowledgeable and friendly. He provided us with drink menus and gave us an ample amount of time to decide. \n\nWe started with the hamachi sashimi, which was a brilliant blend of pomegranate, pear, and avocado with amber jack tuna. A spicy little sauce was plated along with it, and the mix was really tasty. Beautiful presentation as well. \n\nMy main course was the Thaikkal curry, which was a fun, educational dish for me. First, the eggplant was fire-grilled, which blended so well with the curry sauce. It was plated with bean sprouts and slices of fresh mango, which I had never thought to pair with a curry. The roti was fried, which I didn't prefer. \n\nMy husband ordered the seafood hot pot. Quite a full portion of seafood with a side of rice, this vast array of shellfish went down quick. His comment was \""It's Big Burrito salty.\""\n\nReally savory food and pleasant service in an atmosphere drowned in Massive Attack. That's Soba."
"2","One of my all time favorite restaurants. Has gone through a couple of face lifts with the most recent being the best. The bar side, where I go almost every time is much more comfortable and cooler than before. \n\nThe drinks. I think they have a pretty decent cocktail and wine list. They are very well made and although expensive, pretty generous. Really like Laura the bartender. She is solid. The beers on tap are minimal and pretty safe bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle, but not a beer snob Mecca. \n\nThe food. I really enjoy places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things. I can't remember a small plate I did not like and can remember a few I wish would come back.....uhhh soft shells...  Usuall don't go for an entree but my wife and I split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious and very cleverly done. \n\nIt is expensive but very high quality and It's a great place to come alone, as a couple or a group. One of BB's gems."
"2","Definitely one of the better and more upscale modern Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh (excluding Thai food- so many good options). This was my first time at Soba after spending many visits at Umi. I would argue that Umi is the better sibling with excellent sushi options (with a hefty price tag) but Soba is a bit more approachable to the person who is less familiar with or doesn't want sushi. In all, it's a good place for a date with a desire for reasonable and modern Asian fusion. \n\nAmbience:\nTrendy, dimly lit and very clean decor. It suits the cuisine and is well set for small groups or a date. Not too loud but certainly not dead either. I loved the bar area- has a mix of bar and casual couch/lovechair seating that's well suited for a date or small group. Based on the clientele and set up, I'd lean towards trendy attire if you come here- not a casual place by any means. \n\nFood:\nThai corn chowder- so good and very rich. I would return just for that dish. For an entree, I had the seared rare tuna. They definitely didn't skimp on my portion of tuna and cooked it well. Granted tuna is a bit bland, I was hoping for more seasoning and oomph from the Korean barbecue sauce. The ginger fried rice made up for any disappointment I had with the tuna. For dessert, the chocolate pretzel stack was fantastic- perfect mix of chocolate, sweet caramel and the salty wonton chip. \n\nDrinks:\nThe old fashioned was well-executed. Went back for a second. Can't speak for any of their other cocktails."
"2","Amazing Two Fish Tempura Fat Roll...one of the best things I've tasted, seriously.\nExcellent Thai Corn Chowder.\nIncredible Black Cod.\nThis place does Asian Fusion well!"
"2","This review is more general as opposed to a single visit, and applies to Soba post renovation. \n\nGoing here, the more expensive price is expected, and honestly worth it. I don't mind paying more money when the food is delicious, the service great on all levels, and the ambiance enjoyable. Soba achieves all three with flying colors. The first time I came with a large group and sat in the main dining area, and we were accommodated very well with fast flawless service. We ordered a variety of dishes and I can't say I disliked any. I normally hate tofu, but I even enjoyed the fried tofu dish. I've come back twice since then, to eat in the bar area. Whether the place was crowded or less busy, there was no variation in the high quality of food and the speed and friendliness of service, a rare accomplishment. \n\nMy advice for people coming here is to order a bunch of appetizers to share. The variety of flavors and foods is remarkable and it gives you a chance to experience the diversity this kitchen is capable of without investing a lot in one dish. That isn't to say that the entrees aren't also amazing, but this will help you have an idea of what you like best here and pick entrees that suit your tastes. But don't forget to make space for dessert. Their drink menu is also quite extensive, especially their offerings of a variety of sake to suit any dish or preference ranging from a standard carafe of warm sake to some limited edition bottles. \n\nIf you're in the mood for Asian food and want some great fusion cuisine, this is the place to go. It's also a great place for a date or happy hour with colleagues/clients. Happy eating!"
"2","A great salon experience in Pittsburgh. Johnnie was fab and trimmed my hair exactly to my liking. Highly recommended!"
"2","I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.\n\nThe staff was friendly and service perfect. There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.\n\nBeggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy with this dressing, just about perfect.\n\nNext the miso soup: I'm not generally a huge fan of miso soup, but this was probably the best preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. \n\nFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good.  The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish.  The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so.\n\nMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki.  The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen.  Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice.  More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. \n\nI didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can. I don't really care to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh."
"2","Went to this place with my friends. Everything we had was amazing. The appetizers were delicious. This is what I ordered:\n1. Miso Soup: Was awesome!!!! very flavorful. My only complaint is there wasn't enough Wakame for my likening. But over all, it was AWESOME!!\n \n1. Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly and literally melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect.\n \n2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside. It was to die for!!!\n \n3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not a great choice to begin with, this was okay, nothing to rave about.\n \n4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside. It was delicious!!!\n \n5. My friend had the assorted Sashimi. The serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff. The white tuna was delicious as was the salmon."
"2","This place has the absolute best food I've ever eaten, not just in the sushi category.  My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and both had the omikase. We both love sushi and both agree that this was hands down the best sushi and Japanese food we ever had. BUT, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the portion size. I was perfectly happy with the portion size but my boyfriend was not. I think the disappointment came more from his expectation of 7 courses of an American meal. I, however, was expecting portions smaller than the typical American meal. \n\nThe restaurant is pricey, but if you love sushi you have to go. The sauces perfectly complement the fish. The shrimp was absolutely perfectly cooked. The food itself is to die for and worth the price, just don't go expecting American size portions."
"2","Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality if standard places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. \n\nThe first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: price. Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.\n\nThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here. One of the best meals I've had in PGH yet!\n\nA final caveat: don't forget to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy night."
"2","Umi is a Big Burrito venture (a local restaurant group), which means you're guaranteed to pay a decent amount for your dinner and there's a decent chance your dinner is going to be worth it.  Some BB places are worth the cost and some aren't.  Umi, happily, is worth it.  It's still pricey, so this probably isn't the place to sate your random Thursday craving for sushi, but it is an excellent special occasion place for the sushi lover.\n\nUp a few flights of stairs in a minimalist environment, Umi serves up excellent sushi (and a really nice octopus salad), including some higher quality varieties you can't always find in the mid-range places--toro and uni spring to mind.  This is not the kind of place you order chicken teriyaki (and if your date does order this, break up with him/her), Umi takes its suhsi seriously and the waitstaff is generally very helpful in navigating the menu, although I did have one experience there in which the waiter seemed like he was preening about his (legitimate) sushi knowledge.  The Omakase is expensive, but worth it.  But obviously, you can still have a great meal at Umi without dropping $75+ a head.  Excellent spot for a date or a small celebration."
"1","I used to go to Chaya in Squirrel Hill at least once a week, but since I've moved this past summer, it's been difficult to enjoy sushi as frequently.  Thus, I decided to test out Umi based on the good reviews I found on the web.  Sadly, I was grossly disappointed.  The interior decor is pretentious (large water fountain in the middle of the dining room and \""Japanese style\"" paintings and decorations throughout) and dark (who likes eating in a place where you can barely see your food?).  The sushi was okay at best, but the quality of the fish certainly does not even come close to Chaya's.  The dishes were overpriced for the quality of the food, basically you'd be paying for the fake ambiance.  I guess the waiter was nice in that he tried to explain our dishes, but frankly he does not know too much.  This is one of those Americanized versions of an Asian restaurant and not authentic (key indicator: most of the patrons were not Asian).  It was nothing that would make me want to come back."
"1","Went to Umi last night, and it was tough to get a reservation, which is usually a good sign. But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really.\nWe began with the miso soup, which was some of the\nbest we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there.\nThe salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty.\nWe then moved on to the \""good stuff,\"" or so we thought...\nWe began with the highly-recommended \""yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce\"" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \""sushi entree (assorted)\"", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day.\nI was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places).\nNext to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining.\nOur waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it.\nWe concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \""sister-restaurant,\"" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh).\nOverall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far.\nSo insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale.\nTo people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime.\nIt's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special.\nI can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \""essence\"" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard."
"2","This is the real deal...in Pittsburgh. Don't expect flop down for a casual California roll here. They take the sushi and the experience very seriously. The downside is that it you'll never be satisfied with average sushi again.\n\nPro tip: make reservations days in advance."
"1","According to the Pittsburgh Magazine, this is supposedly one of the best 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Clearly they have never been out of their city, county or state. I suggest they take a trip to Philly and try some of the good Japanese food. Regardless, the snapper/fluke/yellowtail yuzu jalape\u00f1o is a nice touch, but not a must try. Service is sketchy here at best."
"1","First off, I cannot comment on the food.\n\nI went on a Sat at 6.00 thinking it was early enough to not be too busy.  I had checked THEIR website about reservations and didn't see anything so assumed they didn't take them.  We wanted to sit at the bar anyway.  When we got there, the place was about 1/2 full at best.  He told us there were no open reservations until 9.00 (then why is the place half empty?)\n\nThat was fine by us, we wanted to be at the bar which had NO ONE AT IT.  He told us that to sit at the (empty) bar, we had to spend $50/person minimum.  WHAT?!  Now, I was prepared to spend some money, believe me, but what if I don't like the menu or I run out of time for dessert?  So, we weren't allowed to sit at the bar or a table.  We were pretty shocked so went somewhere else that didn't have a minimum spending to sit at a fuller bar.  \n\nI will never go back.  They completely turned two cute girls away that were ready to spend probably $80 in 45 min and had a pretentious attitude about it."
"1","I had some pretty high expectations for Umi, since it claimed to be the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Those expectations kind of fell flat.\n\nService here on a Saturday night was atrocious.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink and then another 20 min before we were asked what we would like to order.  Not OK.  On top of that, our interactions with our waiter were just awkward.  Something seemed to be up, like there was some tension going on with him and maybe the staff/kitchen?  \n\nAs far as the sushi goes... it's pretty good.  I got some maki rolls, which were very good, but nothing spectacular.  Miso soup... OK.  Salad was OK.  \n\nThe sashimi definitely seemed like a better option and something they took greater pride in.  The people next to us who had ordered some sashimi options and seemed quite satisfied.  If I come back again, I'll make sure to order sashimi.  However, I was so annoyed by the lack of service that I doubt I'll be back anytime soon."
"2","I've been meaning to try Umi for what seems like forever, since I am a huge fan of Soba downstairs. But it just seemed like I didn't have a reason since this is such a \""special occassion\"" type of place. So I was super excited when Sheryl T. organized a UYE here. I wanted to let the dinner marinate in my head a bit before writing the review (well actually, I've just been really lazy and terrible at writing reviews lately), and I'm not exactly sure what to say about it other than it was outstanding.\n\nMost of us did the 8-course omakase. The portions are interesting, it starts out with a couple very small plates (tartare, sashimi) and you're thinking like, \""oh my god, I'm going to be so hungry after this.\"" But they get more substantial with some nigiri and a couple warm plates, and finally a gigantic dessert and at this point you're like, \""oh my god, that was way too much food.\"" Overall, the tasting menu played out nicely. My faves were the nigiri (creative, but in a way that pays homage to sushi rather than bastardizing it...not that I don't like spicy-tuna-fried-scallop-topped-with-tuna-tataki etc etc...but this is not the place for that), the miso black cod (simple, but done well), and the rock shrimp tempura (the sauce was a little heavy for me, but the shrimp itself was light and succulent in a way that I didn't know deep-fried food could possibly be).\n\nThe desserts are the same ones found on Soba's menu and as I said, they are pretty rich and ridiculous. Actually, if I had any one thing i'd change, it would be that I would prefer a lighter dessert to complement the type of food here, but that could be because I'm just not a big dessert person. But it was pretty awesome to get to try every dessert on the menu! (I guess that's what happens when six ladies go out to dinner together...haha)\n\nI would definitely come back again, although it is very pricey so it's not so much a place to come and stuff your face with maki, and more of a birthday/anniversary/graduation/other major life event celebration spot. So, I guess I just need to find an excuse to come back. Thanks again for organizing, Sheryl!!"
"2","Very fresh sushi and great atmosphere. The chef gave us complimentary appetizers and desserts, but we gladly gave the house more business by ordering tasty sushi and drinks."
"2","My friend and I went there last night and it was so good I can't stop thinking about it.  Even if I could stop thinking about that dinner, I'll be reminded of it every time I check my bank account balance because Umi must be the Japanese word for \""you think you can afford this, but you cannot.\""\n\nI will absolutely dine at Umi again.\n\nI wish I'd ordered the Omakase, which is $85 but provides a sampling of everything and from the other reviews here it looks like a lot of people recommend it.  I advise ordering the Omakase because while $85 seems pricey, you're bil is going to be close that anyway.\n\nI know I keep talking about money and it makes me sound like a peasant, but having abject sticker shock at the end of any dining experience is never fun.\n\nIt was, however, worth it.  My friend and I ordered a bunch of different things and everything was EXCELLENT!\n\nWe had:\n\nvegetable tempura\nmiso soup\nwhite tuna sashimi which basically melts in your mouth\ntuna tataki\nsalmon with mushroom sashimi\nsawara w garlic ponzu which was good but we found the garlic a little overwhelming\ncalifornia rolls\ntuna and cucumber rolls\nspicy tuna rolls\nat least 4 carafs of sake\n\nI highly recommend this place, this would be a good place to go on a date if you aren't paying or if you are traveling with a corporate credit card.  \n\nMAKE RESERVATIONS.  We were there on a Wednesday and the guy who answered the phone to take my reservation acted like he was doing me a favor to fit me in.  It was a little crowded, but we were able to sit at a tatami table.\n\nPro tip:  Wear pants.  A family w kids sat at the tatami table across from us and it was a bitch to get out of the tatami table while wearing a maxi dress without flashing everyone. Which is impressive since it was a long skirt.\n\nIn summary:  Go to Umi, but only if you aren't paying.  Trust your servers recommendations, and get the Salmon & Mushroom sashimi"
"2","i've been to Umi for sushi several times and haven't been disappointed in the quality of the fish.  yes, it's delicious and high quality food.. so why the four stars you ask? \n\nbecause it's just a bit too pretentious for my taste.  yes, it's great quality fish and yes, the decor is very traditionally beautiful japanese... but what you read about the snobbery is true... 50$pp minimum @ the sushi bar? please.  \n\ni agree with a previous reviewer, it's beautiful, high quality food and service... but i always leave feeling like something is missing."
"2","I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend for dinner.  We decided to come here since it was the last of the Big Burrito restaurants that my girlfriend had not tried.  The inside of the restaurant is quaint with a sushi bar on one side where you can watch Mr. Shu ply his craft and many tables on the other longer side of the restaurant.  There are also a decent amount of sheet metal fish sculptures throughout the restaurant which I enjoyed looking at.\n\nWhenever our server came over, we queried him about a few of the Umi specials and in addition to the information about the dishes he told us that they were essentially big appetizers which was good to know.  After hearing that we decided to start off our meals with the sawara with garlic ponzu and squid pasta with garlic sauce.  Since we had also both ordered entrees with my girlfriend getting the terayaki salmon and myself the seafood tempura with a side spicy tuna maki, our meals actually started with a miso soup and ginger dressing salad.  There was nothing special with either although I do always enjoy both at many sushi places. Soon after we finished those the sawara came out and it was a Spanish Mackeral cut into 7 pieces with a tiny sliver of raw garlic on top surrounding the garlic ponzu.  We were instructed to wrap the fish around the garlic and dip it into the sauce which we both did.  The combined flavors were very enjoyable with the standout being the sauce.  After that our squid pasta came out which was some squid that looked julienned and then seared with some shitaki mushrooms and asparagus on top of a bed of garlic sauce.  This dish was interesting for me as I was not a big fan of having the squid in the sauce alone but really enjoyed it whenever I combined it with some of the vegetables.  The Shitake mushrooms might actually have been the best that I have ever had as they seemed to melt in your mouth.  After we had finished the plate our server ended up bringing out a side of rice onto which he poured the sauce from our now empty dish.  In doing so he explained that the sauce was too good to waste.  After trying the sauce covered rice my girlfriend and I both readily agreed with him.  Finally after making our way through all of the other courses, our entrees came out.  My seafood tempura ended up consisting of broccoli, asparagus, crab, fake crab and a single piece of fish all breaded in tempura with a side of soy sauce.  This dish was actually the biggest disappointment of the evening for me for a few reasons including the single piece of fish and also that it seemed to lack the depth of flavors that the rest of the dishes so nicely displayed.  Thankfully my maki was delivered at the same time and had a flavor punch that diverted me from the much more vanilla tempura.  Since I am not a huge fan of salmon I did not try my girlfriends dish but she did assure me that she enjoyed it whenever I asked her about it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely be back in the future.  I am not so sure that I would order an entree again but I would certainly love to try more of their creations and could probably make a meal of their maki and sushi."
"2","Based on past Yelp reviews, I had two main concerns with dining at Umi: the expense and the small portion sizes.  Luckily, neither of these turned out to be an issue.  In fact, my boyfriend and I were able leave feeling satisfied and without spending over $100 (not including tip).\n\nAlthough I had heard rave reviews about the Omakase tasting menu, we decided to order off the menu.  We went with the Vegetable Tempura appetizer and ordered the sushi and sashimi platters to split as our entrees.  The platters both came with miso soup and ginger salad.\n\nThe sushi platter came with one small 6-piece maki roll and 8 pieces of sushi.  The sashimi platter was presented in a bowl of ice and consisted of five varieties of fish.  Everything was very tasty and obviously high-quality.  A pic of our order: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/umi-pittsburgh?select=AhZ3Ixr2boyQFTtvVKeQHg#AhZ3Ixr2boyQFTtvVKeQHg\n\nAt this point, we had eaten Vegetable Tempura, Miso Soup, Salad, and a variety of sushi and sashimi.  We were still a little hungry, but decided some dessert would do the trick.  We observed what some of the diners around us had ordered, and decided to go with the ice-cream sandwich dessert.  If the sushi and entree portions here are considered small, the dessert portions are definitely normal or even large.  The table next to us had ordered a delicious looking banana sundae with three scoops of ice-cream, and I've heard the chocolate pretzel dessert is awesome too...next time!\n\nWhen it was all said and done, my boyfriend and I had ordered two drinks, an appetizer, soups and salads, two entrees, and dessert, all for about $98.  Not too bad, and probably comparable to other high-end restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n\nMy only complaints...I wish the lights had been a bit more dim, and we were absolutely freezing during our meal.  It seemed as though a door or window was open somewhere behind us and was letting in a gust of wintery air.  However, the ambiance overall was very enjoyable, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or special occasion.  The free valet parking is a great perk too."
"2","OVERALL:\nThe best meal I've had in Pittsburgh! Yes - this beats out the likes of Casbah, Eleven, Nine on Nine, and Tamari.\n\nFOOD:\nExcellent. Having heard enough good things, we opted for the Omakase (chef's choice). Course after course of sensationally prepared sashimi and nigiri-sushi, with sauces that were flavorful enough to set off the fish, yet delicate enough not to overpower it. \n\nMr. Shu presented us with Maguro (Tuna), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Kanpachi (young Yellowtail), Saba (Mackerel) and a few others. Miso soup, of course. There was one cooked course - a buttery soft fillet of cod that simply melted in the mouth.\n\nThe culinary delights continued with desserts. I got the chocolate maki, which was rich and delicious. Thankfully, it was also the only time that maki made any sort of an appearance at the table. Truth be told, I was a little apprehensive that the Omakase would include a few courses of maki, especially since the table next to us seemed to be busy wolfing down California rolls.\n\nAll in all, an excellent tasting menu. Portion sizes were just right, with enough food to leave you happily sated, but not stuffed. I was surprised to see reviews complaining about the small portion sizes - sushi is not something that you traditionally expect to find in Cheesecake Factory size portions!\n\nSERVICE:\nService was about average. Servers were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, but a little on the slow side. We had a reservation and we were seated within a few minutes. It took us a little while after we were seated for them to get our drink order and there were a few other times when we were looking for a server but couldn't find one. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nThis is really the only thing I'd knock about Umi. I feel like they had the potential to really go for an upscale Japanese look and didn't. Instead, it feels a bit haphazard, with a mish-mash of a traditional and contemporary that doesn't quite mesh. It's by no means bad though - it was comfortable and enjoyable - just not up to its potential.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nThis is a place you can take your friends who are visiting from NYC or Philly and have it more than hold its own. Do yourself a favor and skip the grocery store rolls and go for the Omakase."
"2","One of the best Sushi experience I had so far. I was on a short visit to Pittsburgh and looking for a good sushi joint for dinner, went by the yelp reviews and as always it was a good experience. \n\nI tried their sushi (assorted) which comes with soup and salad. Soup and salad were amazing to start with and sushi combination was pretty good. Overall with couple of drinks it costed me 50$ but it was worthwhile i would say\n\nService was very professional and attentive, and the overall ambience was awesome.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good sushi."
"1","Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime\n\nI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor."
"2","Went to Umi last night on a first date.  The wine was delicious, had two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and ordered 4 rolls to share.  Spicy Tuna was delicious, there was no spicy mayo, but it didn't even need it.  The spicy softshell crab roll was amazing and i stuffed it into my mouth as usual because its a larger sized sushi.  The most delicious was the Eel and cucumber roll.  The other was the green fuji, this was different and delicious.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate covered pretzel and it was out of this world.  Chocolate mousse, chocolate salty pretzel rounds stacked on top of each other with caramel drizzled over the entire thing.  I'd go back just for dessert.  I'd also like to try some entrees but we were there just for sushi.\n\nWill definitely go again."
"2","My favorite sushi in the city of Pittsburgh. I gave 4 stars and not 5 due to cost $$$$! We try to eat here at least 3 to 4 times a year. The sushi is the freshest and most tasteful. I lived in Los Angeles for 8 years and was spoiled the sushi restaurants. \n\nI have introduced numerous friends to sushi at Umi that had never eaten Sushi before and now they love it. I have brought friends who thought their local place was good and I said that I am a sushi snob. Once they tried Umi they understood what I meant and how better their sushi was. \n\nTry the spaghetti squid  along with the miso crusted black cod."
"2","Excellent cocktail menu first of all, followed by an excting dinner menu that has not failed yet. Sushi has always been fresh and perfectly presented. I've made this a regular on my dining rotation."
"2","I love coming to Umi to celebrate any occasion, big or small. It's become a fun celebratory spot for my husband and me. We find it's possible to get out without spending an arm and a leg if you do it right. Don't expect to get stuffed, or else you will be spending beaucoup bucks. But like I said, it is possible to eat here for a reasonably. I recommend starting with a starter such as the tuna sashimi, but don't waste $7 on edamame that you could buy at Trader Joes. Then start with 6 or so rolls. You can always order more later if you are still hungry.\n\nI love the Pinot Gris by the glass from the Willamette Valley. Its crisp acidity goes perfectly with maki rolls and sushi.\n\nThe white tuna sashimi is a perfect starter. My mom (who hated anything resembling raw fish before coming to Umi) couldn't get enough of this. It's a must.\n\nThe white fish and mint is my favorite roll. Something about the brightness of the mint against the subtle, freshness of the white fish makes this roll absolutely to die for. I also can't get enough of the salmon sushi. It's topped with cream cheese and cherry tomato. Our waiter recommended it to me once, and I have to order at least one piece every time I go!\n\nThey use Soba's dessert menu, so it's great that I can get all my favorite Soba desserts when I come to Umi."
"2","Best sushi in Pittsburgh. Small restaurant so definitely make reservations and try the omakase. Like the tatami mat seating as well."
"1","This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff.  As of our last visit, about two months, ago, the menu still had not changed, the portions of fish were smaller while prices stayed the same, and the atmosphere was on par with that of a Hofbrauhaus.  A drunken man knocked into our table on his way storming out of the restaurant which was immediately proceeded by the members of two different large tables rising from their chairs and yelling obscenities at each other.  It literally looked like there was going to be a brawl.  The members of these tables fairly quickly left the restaurant; however, the staff and manager simply acted as if nothing had happened.  No one came by to see if things had spilled on our table which was run into.  It was absolutely not the experience we expected to have, and it is a disappointment that this place has gone downhill."
"2","Went to Umi for my wifes birthday.  What an amazing experience.  Our server Larry was not only extremely knowledgeable about the menu, but he is a genuinely fun person.  Even though he was very busy, he always just checked in to see how we were doing.  We started off with the white tuna sashimi and the yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce.  Both were a fantastic start to our meal.  The fish melts in your mouth.  We then had the assorted sushi and sashimi plates.  The preparation and quality of the fish is so far superior to any sushi restaurant in the area.  Absolutely fantastic. We then ordered something I have heard stories about for years.  The Black Cod with Miso.  This dish in and of itself is one of the best, if not the best thing I have ever eaten.  It's perfect.  It left me speechless.  \nIn some reviews people have written that they think the portions are small.  Let me say this about those reviews.  It's quite simple actually. Quality over quantity.  You can get sushi at a number of places in Pittsburgh.  Umi however is a true dining experience for the true sushi lover.  Do yourself a favor, book a reservation and go.  You will not be disappointed."
"1","Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced"
"2","I'm very surprised at the quantity of low reviews for this place, as I think it has the best sushi in the city and is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Yes, it is pricey but I think it's safe to assume that the quality and freshness of fish here is a little bit higher than the stuff you see at your local Giant  Eagle.  \n\nI definitely suggest trying the Wasabi Tobiko ($4 per piece).  Such a unique piece of sushi, and one of the reasons I've been counting down the days until my next visit to Umi."
"2","Exquisite!!"
"2","Lots of options. The sandwiches are moderately priced and good. Avoid the cupcakes - they are dry."
"1","It is rather unfortunate that Pittsburgh doesn't have ANY privately owned strictly bagel joints. Bagels, in my opinion, are one of the best breakfast alternatives to actually sitting down to a nice breakfast. I want this - being a student, basically full-time server, volunteering - my life pretty much requires a bagel breakfast every now and then. However, I'm in Pittsburgh, where can I go?\nEisteins? Brueggers? These place are virtually the same. Panera? I used to work here so not only do I dislike the taste, but I have a natural aversion to eating anything from this place. \nBagel Factory! Yes! No...these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere. Just as chewy, that taste of \""this is feigning fresh because it is warm and was just heated up, but it's definitely not fresh fresh.\""\nSadly, this is what Pittsburghers must settle for. I we can hope for is that one day a kind Philadelphian or New Yorker will show us the light, and bring us light, fluffy bagels of my dreams!"
"2","Best bagels in Pittsburgh. It reminds me of the bagel shops I grew up with on Long Island. \n\nThe bagels are appropriately chewy, and they've got a great selection. I've had a bunch of different types (salt, everything, sesame) and they were all delicious. They also have a selection of desserts and other foods."
"2","I am not sure what makes a perfect bagel but after eating at Bagel Factory I am pretty sure I am darn well close to it. Don't let the drab decor of the store fool you. Bagel Factory churns out delicious perfections of bakery like no one's business and we were told that the Penguins get their bagels from here too so we know we are in the right place. I've ordered the lox sandwich, and egg ham and cheese sandwich - both on everything bagels. The lox I think is my favorite and I'd love to come back to try a Cinnamon one. Soft and fluffy with a bit of crunch. Watch out, you'll find this tasty bit gone within seconds."
"1","The food at this location was about the same as at the Squirrel Hill location on Forbes Avenue (not bad, not great), but I thought the service was far worse. One of the male employees helping us referred to one of the females as an \""old hag\"" which I thought was extremely unprofessional and uncool. I'm sure he was joking, but that's still not something he should have said around customers. This tainted the whole experience for me and I probably won't be returning. My dining partner agreed."
"1","I was waiting for my laundry on Ellsworth last week, when I decided to kill some time and find nearby food.  A bagel sounded good and the Bagel Factory felt like an appropriate transition from the Laundry Factory.  I'd never been to the Bagel Factory before, but figured they'd have decent bagels and their coffee had to be better than Crazy Mocha. \n\nThe place was kind of a mess.  When I entered, I saw stacked boxes topped off with cartons of bottled water and individually packaged goodies stacked in front of the bagel case, which seemed sloppy and strange. It felt like a regular storage place for new merchandise, not a new shipment in active transit.  I wondered how an establishment like this could afford to exist on Ellsworth Ave, a neighborhood that is trying to exude upper-class image. Once I looked up from the hoarded pile of shit blocking the counter, my eyes skimmed over the mass of individually wrapped frosted cookies covering the other counter. My mind was taken to the memory of an off-roading experience a few years back; those times when you're driving down the highway in say western Illinois, and you end up at some shabby mom-and-pop bakery, like this one, and you think to yourself \""I'm having a unique experience...\""\n\nGiven that I was coming from the cleanest laundry facility I've seen in my life, these first five seconds at the Bagel Factory were perhaps moderately surprising.  The woman behind the counter had several projects going on and I waited for about two minutes until she asked me what I'd like.  These two minutes were a fascinating two minutes, as the man behind the register was chatting up some eight to ten year old girls.  They might have been neighborhood kids, or not.  There was a familiarity to their conversation, which was only subtly uncomfortable as his tone was sordid at worst, belittling at best.  When they got around to paying for their bagels he asked, \""are they naked or do they have cream cheese?\""  My head turned as the elder of the two said, \""cream cheese.\""  \n\nBy now I'd ordered my bagel and approach the register to pay for it and he says to me, \""got a lotta earrings there, bet you set off all sorts of metal detectors.\""  I responded with \""not really,\"" as I handed him my credit card and he handed me a coffee cup.  He printed my receipt, tore it from the spool and said in a sleazy tone, \""paper trail...\""  I typically would have reacted to that, but lacked the energy after my first round of finals week.  \""Be safe out there,\"" he said as I turned to walk away, which triggered a spine-tingling sensation up my back.  Had i just been sexually assaulted or blatantly judged for wearing a few hooped earrings on each ear?  I was wearing Abercrombie and Fitch, skinny jeans and sperries.  Seriously? \n\nIn the end, it makes no difference.  This guy is a creep, and my feeling is that he holds some sort of managerial role at the Bagel Factory, which leads me to conclude this place belongs out of town ten-twenty miles where this man can find animals to harass rather than little girls and college students.  I generally go out of my way to support small business and family owned operations, but this place is the exception.  I will never step foot in this establishment again.  \n\nThe bagel with cream cheese was alright and the coffee was okay but not worth $5.19."
"1","Don't come here from NYC looking for a good bagel and lox, stick w the ice cream."
"1","Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay."
"1","I'm not totally sure why I keep going back here. The place is tiny and dirty. It was super busy and only 2 employees were making food. The owner was on the register but kept leaving to do other things because they were so short-staffed. I felt bad for how overwhelmed the staff must have been, but they worked as fast as they could. \n\nThe food's okay and overpriced. The coffee's terrible. The seating area is crowded. The location on Craig street has had mice and roaches. \n\nThere aren't many bagel places in Pittsburgh, but Brueggers and Einstein's win."
"1","Unfortunately, there are basically no bagel options on the east end of Pittsburgh, so we were forced to come here a few times. The food is decent and there is a large variety of bagels. However, the last few times we've come here the service has been terrible. The man working at the cash registrar at the end was shouting at his employees from across the room and made fun of us for using a Groupon. After we got our food and realized that one of our sandwiches didn't have cheese on it (which we ordered) we proceeded to tell the man at the registrar and he responded by accusing us of lying and charging us an extra .80 Cents for a slice of cheese. Unreal.. save your money and go somewhere else."
"1","Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest, most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced. Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with, and I understood, but she was disrespectful about it. Fine. I left. Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house. So I went in to choose tile, and Alison was impatient and angry. The installer came. Then I went back  to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told \""I should shop at Lowes\"". Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business?  I told Alison she had a terrible attitude, and she said \""I know\"".  Something is very wrong with this place!  The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers....shame on them!"
"1","I went here last night with a couple of friends befor watchin' the black and gold complete the almost annual boring task of wooping' on some brownie as* in Cleveland.  We were seated upstairs at a great table upstairs facing ellseworth.  The view was great watching many of my fellow burghers' imbibe on a windy Sunday afternoon.  The positive experience ended here.  Well, maybe except for the humorous menu that made me smile.  The waitress was so below average, you know the type... she is doing you a favor by taking your order.  I had the pierogies appetizer which was flavorless potato filling served in a overcooked pasta shell served in vegetable oil with maybe one or two slices of onions.  Come on!  This is Pittsburgh. You should be ashamed.  Then another server brought my burger and I made the unforgivable mistake of asking her to grab me another beer.  Sorry, I know you are not the one who took my order, but you are bringing my food.  I've made this mistake before and usually the person says \""okay, I'll let your server know\"", not \""Ummmm, I'm not serving you,, you'll have to talk to your server\"".  Funny, I thought you might run into each other in the back.  Anyways, the burger was close to inedible burnt to a crisp resembled a hockey puck.  We also tried the hummus which was pretty good.  I ordered a kettle one with cranberry and was brought absolut.  Friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad.  They both said they were pretty good, if not a little dry.  Then we had to wait 30 minutes to get our bill.  If they executed the food well and had at least average service I'd be back, however they don't and I won't."
"1","Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.\n\nThe best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting."
"2","I frequent Harris Grill quite often. Whenever we need a place in walking distance I always pick them over all the other high priced or mediocre Shadyside restaurant/bars. Their menu changes seasonally and is always hilarious (more so than Mad Mex, which they poke fun at along with other local restaurants). They're surprisingly vegetarian friendly for the amount of meat they have on their menu. I have not had anything here that wasn't delicious; favorites will come and go, but I'm a fan of their HUGE salads and the eggplant lasagna (noodle free). \n\nAbsolutely go for brunch - Sundays 10 to 2. It will either be a buffet or a menu for a fixed price of $13. VERY meat heavy, but I'm sure there is always something veggie-friendly, but never expect vegan-friendly. They include two drinks and a fresh fruit plate - one of the drinks can be a bloody mary (which we got and regretted, it was very unpalatable) or a frozen mimosa (get that instead). \n\nWhat I really love, aside from the fantastic food, is the creative cocktails. These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth. Service is usually either chipper and delightful or just barely okay. We don't come here for the service or the dim lights - we go for a good meal and you should too."
"1","only a stupid, spoiled, new york shiksa such as myself would order something on the menu called a latke at a place like this (\""the boxty\"").  it was disgusting and didnt resemble any latke i have ever seen.  \n\nlucky me, i had about 4 bloody marys during the hour wait for my table so I was full anyway."
"1","This place is going downhill fast. I went for the infamous bacon night this past Tuesday and wow - it sucked. First off, our waitress just wasn't good. She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. \n\nAnyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. \n\nThey were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \n\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.\n\nThe bacon \""baskets\"" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. \n\nOverall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate. The only things Harris has going for it right now are its patios, cleverly written menu, and nice location on Ellsworth ave. Oh, and a lot of condescending d-bags, if you're into that kinda thing."
"2","My go to spot when I just want to relax with some friends.  Great drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good food.  Make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months.  During the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching, or the back patio for a nice quiet and private drink.  Good brunch turns great once the patios are closed, as the brunch buffet becomes a la carte.  This brings about the Breakfast Smil... err, Simile.  Home fries, bacon, sausage, eggs, and pancakes all on one giant plate."
"1","Food: the food at Harris grill is the epitome of average, nothing is great and nothing is terrible, everything is mediocre, there are plenty of options for vegetarians, and they have an unnatural love of bacon here, the appetizers are more interesting than the entrees\n\nPrice: too expensive for the quality of the food, the prices aren't staggering, but considering the quality of the food it feels like you are overpaying for nearly everything\n\nDrinks: beer is one of the strengths of Harris, always a good selection of draft beers, and an extensive bottle beer list, the mixed drinks are all average to below average though and the bartenders do not mix good drinks, aside from the signature Frozen Cosmo I would stay away from everything, including the mojito\n\nAtmosphere: this is what you pay for at Harris, they have a beautiful porch for outdoor seating in the front, an equally nice back porch, and the inside decor is pleasant as well, the menus are very cleverly organized and a lot of personality was put into the presentation\n\nService: the service is average at best, we have had meals and specific orders confused multiple times, service is also slow\n\n(+): great location, great atmosphere, good beer\n\n(-): overpriced food, poor service, worse bartending\n\nWould I go back again? Only because I live nearby."
"2","good food.\ngood drinks.\ngood patio.\nGREAT urinal."
"1","This place just bored me.\nReally don't know what to say.\nBored, bored, bored, bored, bored."
"1","It's a good thing Harris Grill has good beer and Bacon Night since otherwise you wouldn't have anything to occupy you for the 45 minutes to an hour it takes to get food on your table from the point in time that you order.  FYI - definitely order that last round of drinks (plus an additional one) as you ask for your bill since the poor service doesn't stop when the food actually gets to your table.  I wrote HG off the first time I went there, then gave them a second chance after a friend asked me.  Guess what my final assessment is."
"2","Being an outsider to Pittsburgh, I wasn't expecting much before we walked into Harris Grill. As soon as we entered, it was clear that this place had a lot more ambiance. \n\nThe Pro's:\n- The menu is funny.\n- There are a fair number of vegetarian options which are clearly labeled\n- The onion rings are amazing.\n- The portions are large, you can get more than you fill for a good price\n- They have root beer floats!\n- Our server was hilarious, you know that self-deprecating kind of humor\n\nThe Con's:\n- There were a lot of items that had run out\n- The service was a bit slow...it took forever for that root beer float to come out.\n\nOverall, I'd come back!"
"1","Appearance is best\nThe drinks and food don't live up\nTo expectations.\n\n\n(b)"
"2","The fact that this place has a bacon night has impressed me for years.  I would receive fat-smudged pages of letters written at this bar, the samples of Dogfish head dripped onto dog-eared corners for me to scratch, sniff, and lick at my discretion.\n\nThe men's room alone is a reflection I would leave unchanged in my description of this place.  The orange/yellow urinal and the sink are shaped in the Rolling Stone's mouth logo.\n\nNext time I visit Pittsburgh I will do brunch there with friends,"
"2","Completely surprised by this place! The drinks were good, strong & cheap. The food was excellent. For 3 vodka drinks, 2 beers, chicken & veggie quesadillas and mini burgers, we paid $35. Cute, dark, little place with outside seating. We sat at the bar. Got great service!"
"2","Visited this place three times. I never used to go because it was across the street from the original Elbow Room but three times this summer. \n\nI've usually stuck to the Baby Burgher Platter. Burgers are really tasty and just hit the spot. It's not like having a huge burger, but I've never found myself wanting more. Tonight, I think they had some new fries out. Massive improvement over the old ones!\n\nI've never ordered the entree mac and cheese, but it makes for a tasty side. My sister had the Henny Penny sandwich. Just know....it's spicy as all hell. We thought my sister was going to explode. She couldn't finish it. So, if that's your thing, go for it but be prepared. The Pulled Pork sandwich was also a hit with my family.\n\nAs for desserts....they have root beer floats. And that's enough for me. Do they take any skill? No none at all. Is it still wonderful to see one pop up on a menu? Oh yes.\n\nService has always been very efficient and polite, no complaints or rude servers. Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark and loud for my tastes. Patio usually fills up, but if you set up near the big windows, it's almost the same thing but with AC.\n\nAnd they're open late (1:30) which is a huge plus for Pittsburgh. Definitely think I'll spend some more time there."
"1","Mmm not too happy with my recent experience at Harris grill. I visit Ellsworth ave plenty and I have been to Harris grill on numerous occasions. After working all day, and driving 2 hours to get home I was a little grumpy and wanting a good drink.\n\nMy two friends and I decided on the sangria. I've had it on numerous occasions and it can really hit the spot. The waiter suggested the caraf but HB warned us saying that they stuff it full of ice. The waiter insured us we would get around a glass and a half. We bypassed HB and ordered the caraf. Upon arrival we knew it was no bueno! The caraf was heaping full of fruit on the top followed by way too much ice. Our serving glasses also were heaped with the stuff even though we had asked for lite ice. I asked the waiter to pour for us bc I knew sangria was going everywhere. We ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail. We all told the waiter that it was pretty awful but he did nothing to correct the insult. Never ever order the caraf!!\n\nTo eat I had the pulled pork sandwhich and a side of mac n cheese. The flavor of the pulled pork was good and the pasta was delish. I will say the pork had some fatty bites that I didn't care for. All in all when the start of  a dining experience starts the way ours did it can be salvaged with the right customer care. Ours wasn't plain and simple."
"1","harris grill, i think  your menu is trying too hard.\n\nfirst place i went on my visit to pittsburgh.  menu was a little overly silly, waitress was a little underly friendly/helpful/timely, and food, while decent, was overpriced for the quality.\n\ni may be back to pittsburgh, but won't be back to harris grill"
"2","I haven't been home to Pittsburgh for a while and I was really excited to get out and explore the food scene. Although Harris Grill wouldn't have been my first pick (I try to stay away from the preppy Shadyside scene), I was pleasantly surprised by  the atmosphere, food and service!\n\nI really enjoyed indoor atmosphere that mixed trendy decor with dim, sexy lighting. Our server was excellent and kept the drinks coming and I was extremely impressed by their craft beer selection. And I would certainly come back to enjoy their expansive outdoor patio.\n\nI got to sample a lot of different selections. We started with the Dippo de Queso con Carne, which was a spicy mix of chilies, cheese and chorizo. Served with pita bread, it was good but there are better things on the menu. And onto those, the Baby Burgers were delectable as were the 'Britney Spears' (I swear that's the real name). The Britney Spears were marinated and skewered chicken that was served with some zesty chipolte sauce and rich pesto. \n\nAfter all of this I probably would have given 3 stars. HOWEVER, the Mac & Cheese was excellent and as a connoisseur of mac-n-cheese, I know my stuff.  What topped off this meal was the incredible Eggplant Lasagna (Lasagne Aubergine) that I shared with a friend. Now, I'm not one to ever order anything that doesn't have meat in it. But I would truly go back to Harris Grill JUST FOR THE EGGPLANT LASAGNA. The eggplant was breaded and fried and layered with pesto, marinara, and layers of delicious cheese. I would highly recommend this dish to anyone, whether you're a vegetarian or not.  And I will certainly be going back just to check out their bacon night."
"1","I don't really have a good review for this place. It's not that the place isn't good it's just that I don't have an accurate experience to recount.\n\nI went for bacon night. This is on Tuesdays.\n\nI saw an outside patio on my way in. On a nice day, that area seems...nice.\n\nBut the happy hour was good. And once the bacon started it kept flowing. So by far this was the best part. \n\nOh, so while I would have usually given this place 3 stars for simply existing and providing me free bacon, I knocked it down due to the really inept barstaff. I spent way too long at the bar before being acknowledged to order a drink.\n\nYeesh. Too bad I wasn't as cute as one of those girls at the end of the bar."
"2","Two words: Bacon. Night. \n\nYes! Do not adjust your screen, you read right. They have a bacon night here. \nContain yourself! It happens on Tuesdays!\n\nI started coming here when I lived in the area a few years back, and it still has it's charm. I try to make it out for Bacon Night whenever I am in town. The other food is good too, so don't overlook it. \n\nAs for drinks, well, I became knowns as a mojito abuser overnight because of this place, and I don't care who knows it."
"1","Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups, and sometimes it's hard to get a server or bartender to notice you (I've never once thought a group outing here was anywhere approaching \""comfortable\"").  And what about the famed BACON NIGHT?  It's not even good bacon!\n\nThey'll have to knock their game up several notches to achieve the potential contained in their great ideas."
"1","Overcharged $19 and having a food order messed up twice, what more could you ask for? A waitress that doesn't seem to care about any of this? Wish granted!\n\nSo yeah, my food was pretty bland, though my girlfriend said her food was OK overall. Overpriced for what it really was.\n\nI may have come back if it wasn't for the first two items. Instead I'll leave them as a shining failure to customer service."
"1","This place has changed.  Just a couple of years ago, you could count on Harris for good food, good drinks, dependable service, and a great atmosphere.  Those days seem like a distant memory now.  \n\nMy wife and I went for dinner on Sunday (3/11/12).  That was a huge mistake.  The food was just bad.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  The fries were burnt and cold, the slaw was wilted, and the sandwich was mediocre at best.  The worst part was that it took 45 minutes to prepare.  If you're going to serve bad food, why does it take so long to make it? This was topped off by a waitress who never bothered to stop back to check on our drinks. \n\nI was really shocked by how bad everything was there.  I have such fond memories of the place from just a few years ago....  There are too many other nice options in Shady Side to waste one's time at this dump."
"2","Best vegetarian chili on the planet! \n\nI love their pierogies.  The menu is unique and diverse.  Alcohol selection is great too!"
"1","A pleasant enough little place for \""Hipster Yinzers\"" to engage in those unique conversations where everyone talks simultaneously and loudly and no one is heard. The fare is somewhat overpriced for minuscule drinks, meager portions and lackluster service.  Oddly, everyone seems to rave about their tater tots......yeah, the same processed frozen spud you enjoyed in elementary/parochial school."
"2","Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete!"
"1","I have nothing good to say about this place. I've been here on several occasions over the years and here's what I have observed:\n\n1- If the place is crowded (which it almost always is) expect terrible service from your waiter/bartender. Waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu.\n\n2- The food will be overpriced/sub par. On one occasion me and my entire party got food poisoning from their fried calamari\n\n3- You will be seated somewhere awkward/uncomfortable. The interior is cool looking but not functional, gets very congested when there are big crowds. \n\nThere are plenty of other bar/restaurant destinations in Pittsburgh that can deliver and execute the same idea in a much better way. Avoid Harris Grill."
"1","This place offers really poor service. The waitstaff go out of their way to not help you. This has happened to many people I know multiple times. We put up with it so we could get the brunch. We stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter. He was flat out rude and upset my friend so we left and won't be coming back. The food isn't that great (the tacos/fajitas are terrible and flavorless, as is the salad), the drinks are grossly overpriced, and the service as I mentioned before is slow and inept. \n\nOn the plus side the brunch is great (it just ended because of winter), the food is relatively well-priced and the location is great (if you can find parking). I recommend going elsewhere though because it just isn't worth being treated so poorly by the staff. Management should take note."
"1","Light your torches and get the pitchforks, because I'm not shy about writing scathing reviews on some of Pittsburgh's beloved restaurants. I don't enjoy doing it.  I love our city and I think our diverse restaurant choices make us a great place to live and visit. But when I hear great things about a place only to be consistently let down, I have no choice.  That being said, I'm going to have to rip Harris Grill a new one. \n\nI waited a long time before reviewing Harris Grill.  I've been there loads of times; happy hours, bacon night, brunch, crowded Friday nights, and not-so-crowded Monday nights.  Almost every time I have been let down. \n\nI'll break it down. \n\nDRINKS: The drink menu and draft lift offer a solid list of (overpriced) choices.  That's fine.  What isn't so fine is that the bartending is inconsistent and I have too often received ill-concocted highballs and sangria that tastes like Franzia.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but almost every time I'm there at least one or two beer taps \""aren't working.\"" \n\nAPPETIZERS: Nothing really wrong here.  Good spinach and buffalo chicken dips, the \""Britney Spears\"" (chicken strips), and hummus are all very tasty. Thumbs up.\n\nMAIN COURSES: I guess it depends on your taste, but I am simply not enthralled by any of the entrees.  The salads are overpriced for their small size, their highly touted macaroni and cheese is bland, and their chicken quesadillas are NOT quesadillas.  Just about everything on the menu at Harris Grill is overpriced for the quality.  $17 dollars for homemade hamburger helper?  $16 for two fish tacos? \n\nI don't HATE anything on the Harris Grill menu.  Their entrees are between \""ok\"" and \""good.\"" Just overpriced.  I do enjoy the Henny Penny and as I said before, all of the appetizers.  I'd give them a 3-star review if it wasn't for the....\n\nSERVICE:  Or lack thereof.  Sure, Harris Grill gets crowded, especially on the weekends.  That does not excuse the waitstaff from being rude and ignoring their tables for upwards of an hour.  On one occasion, our server clearly forgot about us and we watched astounded as tables seated long after us were brought their meals.  When we finally did inquire about our food,  the waiter made a beeline for the computer to put in our orders.  No apologies, no offer to comp a side or a dessert.  In fact, the check was rushed to us before we even finished our food because the restaurant had a long waiting list.  Bad form, Harris Grill. What makes it worse is that I've been here many times, and have had similar problems with the service. \n\nBut truth be told, I'll probably be back.  Because I really want to like Harris Grill. Moreover, my friends love Harris Grill and I love my friends.  I just sincerely hope they hire more competent waitstaff.  Revising their menu wouldn't be a bad idea, either..."
"2","I am giving Harris 4 stars because it is my neighborhood bar and has sentimental value to me. Minus that, it is probably a 3.5. They have a stellar frozen cosmo but the rest of the drink menu is just okay. Their food menu is a hit or miss. Their turkey burger and mac'n'cheese are great but the rest is probably just okay. Their desserts are unimpressive and it is hard to underwhelm me when it comes to sugar. So I would say, go for the atmosphere and the cosmo but not for much more."
"1","I've visited Harris's Grill a few times over the past 3 - 4 years and every time I leave I ask myself \""Why do people love this  place so much!?\"" The food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best. Minus the bacon gimmicks and pretentious Shadyside vibe... This place is an average bar/restaurant."
"1","My husband and I tried Harris Grill for the first time on a Sunday night. We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June, and unfortunately decided we won't be coming back here before we leave. \n\nThere was only one very small table open in the crammed dining room downstairs when we got there. I'm not sure if there were tables open upstairs, but it didn't look like the hostess checked before seating us. Our table was facing the door, so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out, and we were very close to the table behind us, beside us, etc. We eventually asked to move, but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up.\n\nI thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich, but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese, there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me, so I ended up ordering the \""Henny Penny,\"" a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came, the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy, but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that, so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken, which was nice, and it was fine after that. I also had the sangria, which sounded like it would be amazing from the description, but I actually didn't think it was good at all :( It tasted really watered down to me. \n\nA few redeeming things: the mac & cheese that came with my sandwich was really, really good! My husband liked the fish tacos he had, and three different people checked up on me after the incident with my sandwich, so we at least felt like the staff was pretty attentive."
"2","I had a great time.  great food and cocktails.  exciting ambiance, not for a quiet night out.  but who wants that? :)"
"1","Zero stars for service.  Zero stars for price. One star for food. \nI have been to the Harris Grill three separate times for dining.  The first was happy hour - with a party of six. We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated, service was extremely slow.  Our server was slow to arrive at our table to begin and take our drink order. Our drinks took even longer to arrive (approx. 20 min from when seated.)  The appetizers were tasty, although overpriced. Buffalo chicken dip was very good. Service remained poor.  Perhaps they were just very busy and understaffed. \n\nThe second time I came was midweek, midday, for lunch.  The place was mostly empty.  Surely we would get good, prompt service now?  Not so much.  All I ordered was the chocolate cupcake dessert.   It took about 25 minutes.  It looked like half a cupcake was dropped on the floor, and then attempts made at making the broken pieces look presentable on a plate.  Half of it was luke-warm, half of it was cold.  Terrible.  WTF?\n\nThe most recent and I promise the last time I will ever go to the Harris Grill was a Sunday for brunch.  Again a 30min wait for a party of 3 to be seated.  I understand that - its Sunday - its Brunch - lots of places have a wait.  But again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty.  Finally seated it again took 20 minutes to get our drinks - orange juice. And then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages.  The third took another 10 minutes.  Seriously??  Our food took an hour. SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED!!  Several items on the menu were out.  (We arrived at noon for a brunch that was supposed to last from 10-2pm).  The menu was prix fixed at $14.  $14 for two pieces of French toast with disgusted, dried out frozen tater tots. (They had run out of home fries). The eggs Benedict were dried and hardened - just plain gross.  The eggs over easy had no runny yolk. The sausage was very good.  They served us the wrong toast.  You couldn't get worse food or service at a McDonalds run by newborn donkeys."
"1","Came here with a party of 5 others for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. We were seated immediately but were surprised to learn that there is no brunch buffet during the winter.\n\nMy eggs benedict was good, so was my bloody mary. Don't expect vegetables and meat to go together here--they are mutually exclusive options on this menu. That said, I counted only 3 dishes with any vegetables at all. The coffee was disappointing--it came with plastic cups of half & half. Any respectable restaurant should do better.\n\nOverall, the food is good, heavy, and served in decent-sized portions. I would come here again although there are certainly better venues for brunch in the city."
"1","Disclaimer: This review is only for their Sunday brunch. Wasn't impressed by their Sunday brunch. Didn't like the presentation of the buffet. It was in a small area and felt kind of cramped. The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and didn't look appetizing. My friends ordered orange juice and each glass was filled to the brim with large pieces of ice, which means that they really just had maybe 1/2 a glass of orange juice. In all, it's really nothing special, just very basic. It was my first time eating at Harris Grill. What seems nice is the patio and if the weather had been nice, we would've sat outside and maybe I would've given it an extra star."
"1","The place is good for drinking but definitely not to have a meal. There're not much options on the menu. \nI tried the pasta once and it was tasteless."
"1","Let me tell you about my experience at the Harris Grill, I know I have eaten here before, years ago. So I was in need of a lunch and off to the garden. I decided a nice salad would do the trick so I ordered the Salad de la Burgh. While I waited for my meal I was sitting in the little room right off the bar, first thing I notice is the table is a tad sticky, then I noticed the hole in the wall. After these little gems I started to scope out the place, kind of soak in the atmosphere. \""Filth\"" the joint is run down and fifthly, make matters worse was the cement block propping open the door to the patio outside ( this is the front door to the restaurant people ). \nThe restaurant was busy and my server was a pleasant enough young woman. I received my beverage and then started to check the staff out and how unkempt most of them where, jeans extremely tight and unflattering on the best figures, Harris Grill shirts were not much better trust. I long for the day when restaurants hired servers because they had mad skills not because they are young or hip. My favorite is when I realize that under the host station there were bus pans ( dirty & full ), one young employ thought nothing of maneuvering it with her foot ( disgusting it is on the floor but also the unsanitary way it was handle )\nLet me now explain the salad I got for eleven dollars and some cents. The lettuce was about a cup spring mix I think, not crisp and wilty, and kind of room temperature. The chicken was cold, so was the few fries they put on it, and a half a hardboiled egg. I think I found a few pieces of onion? Two grape size tomatoes, and two thin slices of cucumber. \""Oh\"" there was a sprinkling of mozzarella or provolone cheese on it, could not tell which ( they say both so I will go for that ). This was placed in an average soup bowl. To say I will ever go back to the Harris Grill is a definite not & I will warn others to avoid. \n\""PS\"" I did not expect the salad to be huge or grand but decent and somewhat hearty, this was subpar, could have gotten a better one at Wendy's and it would have been warm meat, and fries ..."
"2","Went for the first time today. Kitchen was just wrapping up a re-model, but they extended happy hour to accommodate and the food was pretty darn good.\n\nThe happy hour specials were a great deal and the staff was really nice. Also love that the patio is in the shade all afternoon/evening. Great summer spot."
"2","I LOVE this place. Here's why...\n\n1.The service is awesome. Hostess jokes while seating you. Awesome. Server knows his shit and rocks at presenting it. Gave us a rundown of the highs and lows of the menu. If he didn't know about something (like a beer we asked about) he went, grabbed samples and came back fully knowledgable on them. \n\n2. The outdoor seating is baller. They have a back area that is no smoking so you don't have to get a whiff of smoke in your face while enjoying the weather and eating. They also have creative seating upstairs. Awesome.\n\n3. The food is DELISH! Try the rib tacos. They are sooooooo good. I've never had a bad meal here.\n\n4. They have a sense of humor. Menu is fun to read.\n\nBeers also aren't overpriced. WIN."
"2","Very good short rib tacos. Long wait for food though."
"2","I normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule; the food is never up to par and it's a cattle call. Usually a poor excuse for restaurants to make money. However, when a local friend suggested we meet here he insisted Harris Grill's brunch was legit. He had me at \""bacon trough\"".\n\nNice patio seating and friendly service! You get a frozen mimosa (and it's not overly sweet or weak; actually tastes like a frozen mimosa) or bloody mary with the $15 all you can eat brunch. Omelets made to order, lox and mini bagels, fresh fruit, trough of well done, really quality bacon as previously mentioned. There's even pre-assembled eggs benedict, which I expected to be a mess but they were perfect. \n\nI wish all brunch buffets were like this. It is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates, but everyone was understanding and laughed off the occasional bumps. Brunch is serious business, you do what you gotta do."
"1","I don't understand why this place is so popular.  I've been there 4 times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently, I ordered a Del Monico sandwich and the thing was dripping with oil.  The beer list is decent."
"2","Great service, great food, great drinks."
"1","I'm a longtime fan of the Harris Grill so please note that my review is specific to brunch only.  My friends and I were lucky enough to get patio seating on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. That was the highlight of brunch- friends and the patio. \n\nThe only option for brunch is to get the buffet. They were packed and couldn't keep enough food out.  The Mac and Cheese, while cheesily delicious was cold. They kept running out of plates. They never had the salmon when I went up- yet I saw it on other patrons plates.  And, insult to injury, my Bloody Mary was watered down. My friend had a Bloody Mary and the olive in it tasted like chlorine. \n\nI will give props to the guy making the omelets.  He had all the ingredients, was quick, and friendly. \n\nLike I said, I'm a big Harris Grill fan and will be back again - just not for brunch."
"1","I can't properly review the food or beverage selections since I never actually got seated.  I came as part of a large group, who specifically chose Harris Grill because it could handle a crowd.  When we arrived, the lounge area--clearly designed to seat 15-20 people--was occupied by precisely two individuals.  That's right, two people leisurely sipping drinks.  The host informed us when we entered that they would be leaving soon.  Half an hour later, they had ordered another drink and seemed to be making small talk with the host: clearly a friend of theirs.  This begs the question: why on earth would a host seat two people in their party section?  I came up with two possible answers.\n\n1. The restaurant hates money\n2. They hired the worst host in Pittsburgh\n\nI'll be returning to Harris Grill sometime this month to try their food, all of which looked and smelled amazing as it whisked past me on plates destined for tables.  In response to the comment below, I wrote this review to call attention to a business practice which seems mutually detrimental to both the restaurant and the customer.  I don't hold grudges and I'm willing to treat the experience as a one-off."
"2","Holy lord Mac and cheese with pulled pork and chili. Very good man drinks, very good lady drinks. Food service and staff. I like that they don't take reservations. Nice outdoor seating area."
"2","Great atmosphere, good food, and lots of unique cocktails. The patio is very pleasant in the summer."
"2","stopped in the Harris Grille last night after doctor visit. Doug our server was fantastic, he was very knowledgeble on all the menu items. he could list the make up of every item. very impressive. they had a unique and interesting list of foods. Both of us had superior Bloody Mary's. I had a carnitas (pulled pork sand) on a pretzel roll with the best Gazpacho I've ever tasted. Wife had a great Flat Iron on Mac & Cheese, very, very  good. We sat in the \""Mural Room\"" trying to interpret the mural with Doug. very interesting. U must go and enjoy this unique grille. It's a fun place in a cool part of PGH."
"1","I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!\n\nWe went to Harris Grill for lunch, we ordered some entree and calamari for appetizer. It was calamari on top of some salad with Thai chili sauce dressing. Just when we almost finished the calamari, I found one entire cigaret in the salad. CIGARET!!!! I have no idea how a cigaret can be in the salad. IT IS JUST DISGUSTING. We left without having the resting of the food."
"2","Harris Grill is a restaurant in a house that looks like The Addams Family's home, but it doesn't mean you should be afraid to eat there.\n \nYou can either sit out front or hide away in the inside OR sit at the bar with giant TV's that usually have on something more interesting than the latest game, sometimes Discovery Channel or Animal Planet.\n\nThe food is a little pricey but the quality justifies the cost.  The mac and cheese is amazing and made fresh there.  The presentation and plating felt high end but the place is very casual.\n\nRumor is Tuesday night is all you can eat bacon night, I'll have to make it for that.  If you go or it's another day, let me know!\n\nTellem HITTofMCM sent ya!"
"2","With the wealth of breakfast and brunch offerings in the Pittsburgh area, it's great to go to one that isn't snubbing it's nose at the rest of the crowd. We were riding around, trying to find a place that didn't have a 4 day wait and would satisfy a monstrous appetite. And of all the brunch places in all the world, this one came walking into my life.\n\nHere's the deal that can't be beat: an unlimited Breakfast buffet with smoked salmon, eggs Benedict, an omelet station, and a frozen mimosa for $15. That's right kids! Add to that the great selection of beers and cocktails and you may need to move in. I was so satiated that I didn't eat another meal the rest of the day.\n\nThe bonus was that there was great outdoor seating so we could participate in some obligatory people-watching.\n\nNext time I am back in this great town, I will definitely be hitting this place up again. I just need to see where I can purchase one of those additional stomachs and an extra-stretchy pair of pajama jeans."
"2","Great evening. \nBasics:\nGreat service, \nVery good food..hamburger Helper ( not like I remembered )\nVery good beer with pumpkin for my wife and met with her approval!\nDesert ...homemade cookie with Ice cream and whipped cream was perfect\nCheers"
"2","Very tasty!  Casual, nice, medium sized bar.  \n\nGreat bloody mary.  Very, very good.  The bartender even made us an off menu blue cheese, bacon, and egg bloody mary which was just insane basically.  \n\nThe Jerk Chicken Mac n Cheese was very good too.  Spicy, spiral noodles in a lightish cheese sauce.  Not super decadent but that's good because it was a HUGE portion.  Everything everyone in our group got looked pretty good.  \n\nSlightly expensive for what it was but whatevs."
"2","Bobby and I stopped here for dinner on Saturday to celebrate his birthday as well as the anniversary of him dealing with me for 3 years (ha-ha)\n\nFor drinks, Bobby ordered a long island (you probably could've guessed that though) & I ordered a glass of sangria (The original. They also had pumpkin sangria). He didn't enjoy his drink too much and i offered for him to try mine because it was delish! Wow, they make an amazing sangria! Bobby also enjoyed it, so we ordered a carafe of this delicious-ness.\n\nFor dinner, Bobby ordered the Thanksgiving burger. It's a turkey burger with cranberry stuffing inside. It sounded really tasty! I almost thought about ordering it before he brought it up. He originally ordered the November throwback of a pork shank, however, someone from the kitchen came upstairs to inform us that it was defrosting since they didn't think another person would order it. It would've been an extra 15-20 minutes which is why he decided on the turkey burger. For his side, he ordered the Mac & Cheese.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered the ever so popular Henny Penny and a side of \""smashed\"" potatoes. The server informed me that the chicken sandwich was a little spicy. I honestly thought i could handle it, and for the most part i did.. but i honestly couldn't finish the last half. It was just so spicy even water wasn't helping. Bobby ended up finishing my other half of sandwich and he gave me his mac&cheese. PS- the mac&cheese is delicious and sooooooo creamy! \n\nFor dessert, we ordered \""The wrongest dessert ever\"" (Please see picture to see why it was given this name.) The dessert was on their November throwback menu and consisted of a fried twinkie, two scoops of vanilla ice cream with a raspberry sauce (maybe chocolate sauce as well).. complete with whip cream. I loved it and i don't even care if you judge me for the calorie intake that i took in at this restaurant. I have full intentions on heading back before November is over to enjoy that dessert again!"
"2","I came here with a few friends today for a late lunch after a race. The service was quick and very friendly.  We ordered Totchos (tater tot nachos) to start and they were delicious! The buffalo chicken dip disappeared within minutes as it was better than any buffallo chicken dip any of us have had at a restaurant.  The seasonal cocktail menu was also great- I had the rum spiced cider and a pumpkin pie cocktail.  To top it off, one of the people in our group has a severe nut/bean allergy, and the entire staff was very accommodating in making sure no nuts or beans touched our food. Will come back again for sure."
"1","I stay 2 blocks away from Harris Grill. I have been to shiloh's grill as well, a caouple of times. Harris Grill used to make awesome food an year ago..now its just boiled vegetablea..steak cut out for you..who would want that!!!!"
"2","PSA: there is a groupon for this place that is valid until May 2015!\n\nBurger was good. Mac and cheese was a little salty and not very warm but it wasn't terrible. Cookies and cream dessert was super yummy. \n\nService was very attentive and we went on a Saturday night. \n\nKinda dim and loud in there...it is a bar after all, and there is some interesting religious art work on the walls."
"2","I really liked this place!!  The atmosphere is inviting and cozy.  We ate upstairs at the table facing the window and it was a nice spot to relax and people watch. It looked like they had other cozy group seating arrangements up on the second floor too.  Our waiter was really nice and attentive.  \n\nThe menu is great.  Not so much that you get lost, but covers enough for everyone's taste....and it's full of jokes and hilarious descriptions.  Lots of comfort food, and tasty twists on classics.  They have a huge drink menu (...more like book) with lots of creative originals.\n\nI had the Cajun chicken mac special (the dish may have actually been titled \""Imagine the Rastabilities\"").  The serving was huge, and the mac was awesome.  It was a bit too spicy for me, but that's just my taste and I think it was a really cozy meal."
"2","I LOVE Hey Betty!  It is such a fun place to simply browse!  I warn you though, you could blow your entire paycheck here.  I play bass in a band (unfortunately, we're not as active as we once were) and most of the time I wear, well, whatever.  Every so often though, I like to wear vintage clothing that I've bought here!\n\nThe collection here is certainly eclectic enough.  They also have vintage accessories too.    They have retro jeans, but I'm really more into vintage dresses and costume jewelry.  They also have retro tee-shirts (and not the ones you can get at Target, either).  My brother once bought a Pittsburgh Gladiators T-shirt and a Pittsburgh Pirhanas jersey here.\n\nSo this is the place to be in Shadyside when you want vintage.  Prepare to empty your wallet here!"
"1","One of my favorite things to do is consignment shop. On a dreary day I decided to look up a few local shops to hit up and my finale trip was to Hey Betty's.\n\nHey Betty's seemed to be very organized. It was a small area, but had a lot to offer without seeming to give you a garage sale vibe. The men's clothing was next to none but I can still appreciate nice things even when they are not for my gender. There were tons of hat boxes and great jewelry pieces to pick from.\n\nThe reason for the 2 star review is the service. The woman working the counter who I'm assuming to be the owner was not friendly at all. We greeted her before she greeted us which I find rude. She did not ask us anything when we were shopping. She just sat there and read a magazine. The only time she interacted with us is when we basically forced her. It was quite the turnoff.\n\nTo me customer service is everything. If you cannot greet your customers or educate them about your items/services you're providing then that's one less store I need to go back to. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for vintage clothing but not to someone who is looking for a great customer service experience."
"2","Although Hey Betty pales in comparison to Eons, it's still one of the best vintage stores in Pittsburgh. The place is small and narrow, but has several floors, so it's bigger than it actually seems.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the selection is sometimes limited (mostly '60s-'70s), but what's for sale is unique and quality, and definitely well-priced.  I once bought a leather bomber jacket from the '70s for $30!  I tend to like their accessories more than their clothing: they have an amazing selection of footwear, ties/bowties, hats, jewelry, gloves and handbags on the cheap.  Hey Betty is such a fun place, and definitely worth a visit if you love vintage!"
"2","Hey betty I need a poodle skirt to go with my new bangs..... or a pink mohair cardigan to match my beehive hairdo. \n\nOr.... a twenties shiffon blouse to make my bonnie and clyde outfit for halloween. No problem found it here complete with its own glass buttons. The owner was helpful in showing me where I could try it on and offered to let me look at items in the cases. \n\nCute little shop more women's clothing then mens. The owner was chatty with me or clerk whichever she was. There are two vintage stores in this area so you can check one then the other if you don't find what you're seeking on the first try..."
"1","I've had a big change of opinion after spending more time in that gym. The equipment would often break down and never get fixed. Considering how small the gym is, it's inexcusable that two treadmills would be out of service for at least a month. I also had problems with the individual TVs on machines; sometimes they wouldn't work properly or would be completely broken.\n\nThe gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings, but it would be pretty packed after work. It was hard to find a machine. The staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy, which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessary.\n\nI was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month). I wasn't told that I had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month). Though they're technically right (it IS in the contract), I feel that their staff mislead me.\n\nIf you live in Shadyside (or nearby)... GO TO URBAN ACTIVE INSTEAD. It's cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than XShadyside... although I apparently have a membership at XShadyside for another month now, I am 100% done with that place."
"2","I love this gym everybody there is soooooo nice and helpful"
"2","I love this gym. The equipment is kept up-to-date. The classes are fun with very energetic and helpful instructors (Bodypump is my favorite).\n\nThey don't supply towels, but the gyms I've been to usually charge extra for a towel fee so I always brought my own, making this a non-issue for me unlike some people.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of parking, but that happens all over Pittsburgh so I'm not surprised. \n\nA huge plus is the staff. They are all super friendly. I recently started having sessions with a personal trainer, and I have seen a DRASTIC improvement in my fitness based on the exercises he has me do. Before I couldn't even hold a plank for 60 seconds. Now he has me using bosu balls and other nifty toys to make different exercises more difficult without piling up a whole lot of weight (weak shoulders).\n\nOverall, I love XShadyside. Unfortunately, I am moving back home (cancellation process was no hassle at all like I've read on here!), but I will definitely miss having a gym like this."
"1","I have been a member for a year. Pretty crowded, lot of machines that do not work and not open all time during week ends. Obviously, compared to a $10 membership at Planet Fitness, the choice is quick ... The reason you would stick to this gym is the classes. If you want a spin class or a yoga class, it coul dbe worth it. If you are only looking for treadmill and machines, membership cost is not worth it."
"1","This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area."
"2","This place is great. We stayed 2 nights and had a very good stay. The room was very clean and comfortable - you basically get your own apartment, which makes for a very relaxing stay. The service is great - they give you muffins, coffee and juice when you check in for your room. Location is great also. We stayed in the back building which was only two blocks from the very cool Walnut Street shopping district. \n\nOverall I'd absolutely stay there again. The only downside was that the heat in the room was up pretty high and we couldn't figure out how to turn the heat down (no room controls). Otherwise a great & very reasonably priced place to stay."
"1","Do you remember the crappy apartment you rented in college or grad school?  The one with the bad a/c and dirty carpet?  The one with the barely functioning electrical outlets and tiny, almost useless, kitchen?  Well if you ever want to relive that experience, stay at Shadyside Inn Suites!\n\nI spent six years of my medical training in Pittsburgh and found myself with a few days off last month.  Why not take my wife and young son back to my old stomping grounds in Oakland and Shadyside?  We've found that when traveling with a young child, staying at suite-type hotels (with at least some sort of kitchen facilities and a separate bedroom) is very useful.  The most convenient suite-type hotel to Shadyside is the Shadyside Inn Suites.  Unfortunately, since this business has a virtual monopoly on the area, it must believe it can put its clients up in deplorable, nearly unsafe conditions. \n\nThese comments are based on our experience with the building on S. Negley Ave.  I believe there are at least two other buildings the hotel maintains as well as \""Mansion Suites\"" which are reserved for VIP's or people staying for very long periods.\n\nGeneral Complaints:\n1.  Exposed electrical and cable wiring (see pics).  We tried to spend as little time as possible in the room because I didn't want our 19 month old to inadvertently touch exposed wires.\n\n2.  Dirt.  Everywhere.  When we were getting ready to leave, I did a quick last run through the room to make sure we weren't leaving any of my sons toys behind.  I made the mistake of peeking underneath the couch.  Yuck.  Food remnants, dirt and debris from who knows how long under there.  Disgusting.\n\n3.  General poor maintenance of the building and its parking lot (see pics.)\n\n4.  The furniture in the rooms looks like it has been there for at least 15 years.  Our dining table was strikingly similar to the one I had in college.\n\n5.  No dishwashers.  Not unexpected given the age of the building.  But if you're not going to give your guests a dishwasher, at least give us sponges so we can wash our own.\n\n6.  When you check in, the hotel bills your credit card for the entire length of the stay ahead of time rather than vice versa (completely the opposite of every other hotel in this country.)  Keep this in mind if you want to leave early after seeing the condition of your room.\n\n7.  Three separate keys are required to get into the building and your room.  Again, completely out of date and not particularly secure.\n\nAlso, the vaunted customer service that they crow about on their website must be limited to special guests and celebrities. \n\n1.  When we asked for an extra blanket to be delivered to our room, we waited for over an hour with no response.  Ultimately, we had to drive back to the main office and retrieve the blanket ourselves.\n\n2.   The remote to the DVD/VCR combo had no batteries in it.  I had to get the AA batteries from the main office (I didn't even bother to attempt to ask them to be delivered to our room) and had to wait while the office staff repeatedly found AAA batteries for me.  I was told the AAA batteries fit the flat screen TV remotes in the rooms.  I had to calmly explain that we did NOT have a flat screen TV in our room, rather we had a non HD CRT TV that was at least 10 years old. \n\n3.  Daily cleaning of the room costs EXTRA.  Be sure to read the fine print.\n\nPerhaps some of its other buildings are more modern and in better condition.  Perhaps we had the worst unit in the entire complex... but I doubt it.\n\nUnless you absolutely have to be within walking distance to a business, client or family in Shadyside do yourself a favor and find a more modern, cleaner, safer and better hotel.  Shadyside Inn Suites should be ashamed of itself for the condition of its facilities.\n\n\n(6/11/10) UPDATE... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay.  \n\nThey report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities."
"1","Update... Shadyside Inn refunded the charges from our stay.  \n\nThey report they are adding staff and upgrading their facilities.\n\nIn response to the manager's comments:  As I noted above, they refunded our stay.  The TV cabling is exposed... perhaps not as dangerous as exposed electrical wire, but not something to be particularly proud of if you consider yourself to be a business built on customer service and the impression of luxury. \n\nThe \""ongoing\"" repairs in the hallways were not touched during our (middle of the week) stay, so one must wonder about the urgency of those repairs.   \n\nThe building we stayed in was not full.  Why did they put my family in the oldest, most dilapidated room? \n\nAs far as moving to a different room, any one who has traveled with children would know how difficult  it is to move from one hotel (or hotel room) to another.  We arrived after a 3+ hour drive at 5pm in the middle of a thunderstorm with a very tired and cranky toddler.  Given the relative level of competence at the front desk at the time of check in, we weren't confident that any room we would be moved to would be any better.\n\nI stand behind my review.  If I could give the place zero stars, I would."
"1","Great location but low on amenities.  HVAC system is ancient and the noise factor on Fifth Avenue is problematic. The price is nice but that's all I can say about the positive."
"1","Our two-night stay at the Shadyside Inn involved three suites and was like a god damn roller coaster ride.\n\nFirst of all, it's a bizarre concept with a bizarre aesthetic. Our suite was essentially a small apartment in a decrepit, tacky building across the street from the main facility. After somehow making it up the steepest driveway of all time, and somehow stumbling across our rooms in the completely unmarked hallways, we actually found that they were quite nice looking.  Felt very much like college dorm rooms - but they were serviceable and clean.\n\nToo clean - it turns out. After we had barely settled in, my cousin came running into our room screaming like a banshee holding out hands covered in soap. \""IT'S NOT COMING OFF! IT WON'T COME OFF!\"" Turns out every single piece of brown furniture in all of our suites was covered with furniture polish that stained our clothes and stuck on our hands.\n\nWe called the office, and were put on hold for ten minutes.  Finally went over across the street, and the staff ended up being very gracious. Apologized profusely, offered to pay to have our clothes cleaned, and removed the guilty furniture from our rooms. Everyone received an apology letter explaining the oversight. We received special attention as the first guests to fall prey to this cruel trick, and received a handwritten apology from the management and two bottles of cheap merlot.\n\nEverything else went smoothly until check-out day. We were heading to a college graduation ceremony and intended to drive, but were forced to walk due to the Pittsburgh Marathon route.  When we called the office to ask if it were okay for us to leave our luggage in our rooms until slightly after check out time (HALF AN HOUR ONLY), they flat out refused to allow it.\n\nAfter shit-fits were thrown and our varnish-debacle resurrected, they allowed us to leave our cars in the lot with the luggage in the trunks, which they initially tried to refuse permission for us to do.\n\nNeedless to say, we did not leave happy campers."
"1","It's with some regret that I rank the Shadyside Inn Suites so low. We were there for just one night, and overall the accommodations appear quite pleasant. \n\nFor starters, we arrived at the office to check in and the gentleman in the office was on the phone. Although we stood there for at least five minutes while he finished, he never made any attempt to look at us, or indicate that he would be with us as soon as possible. As we waited, several other staff people passed us in the office, and never acknowledged our presence. When he finally got off the phone, he was very pleasant, but never even acknowledged the fact that we had been standing there waiting.  \n\nEven though it was almost 1p, we were told that our room was not yet ready, and that it might not be available until 4p, which was the \""guaranteed check in time.\""  I indicated that we had been on the road for hours and we had an important function that evening, before which we really had hoped to catch a short nap. I asked if he could please get us a clean room as soon as possible, and he said that he could call us when the room was ready. To their credit, they did call us within about 90 minutes.\n\nOur room was essentially a small studio apartment, with a bedroom/sitting room, kitchenette and bathroom.  When we entered we were practically assaulted by an overwhelmingly strong smell of some sort of floor or room cleaner - perhaps an artificial lavender scent - so strong it was like walking into a Bath & Body Works.  Almost immediately my partner developed a bad head ache and we had to leave the door open for about 20 minutes to air it out.  Though the scent diminished a little, it remained strong for the duration of our stay.\n\nThe furniture was modern and the room well laid out.  It included an open wifi network, a rather large flat-screen tv connected to basic cable, a queen sized bed, a large arm chair, and a dining table with chairs. There were a few tacky prints on the walls that appeared to have been designed by some Thomas Kinkaide wannabe.\n \nAs it was January, it was rather cold out, and so we sought to turn up the heat, which was provided via an old radiated steam heat system in the bedroom/sitting area.  There was no wall thermostat, so we had to fiddle around with the knob at the base of the radiator, but as anyone who is familiar with those older steam systems, they're touchy and hard to control. There was also a radiator unit in the bathroom, but it didn't work, which meant it was rather chilly when you stepped out of the shower. The entire evening we found ourselves trying to adjust the heat in the main room, and often opening the window just a crack, to compensate for excess heat, or closing it to allow the heat to build up again. It was bad enough that neither of us got a good night's sleep, because we found ourselves either sweating or shivering, and the temperature never evened out.\n\nI had some work to do while we were there, so after dinner, I sat down to use my computer and the wireless network, but at about 10P, the network shut down, and didn't come back.  I called the main office, only to get a voicemail saying that they were closed; there was an emergency number, but I didn't feel that I wanted to go to that trouble.  I kept checking periodically, but the wifi didn't come back that night.  In fact it wasn't on the next morning when I woke at about 7A.  I called the office again, but the same voicemail was still on, and still again at 7:30A and at 8A.  Finally after I got out of the shower at about 8:30A, the wifi was back.\n\nThe final straw occurred as we were leaving. There was no elevator in the old building, so we had to use the stairwell. Apparently someone had mopped the stairs, but good, shortly before we left our room, and they were slippery and wet, but we were not aware of this, as there was not \""Caution Wet Floor\"" sign, and the stairwell was not illuminated enough to be able to see quite how wet the floor was.  As a result, on the very first step down, my foot slid out from under me, and I landed hard on my backside. Fortunately I wasn't hurt, though I did spend several days with soreness afterward. When I stood up, I realized that the floor had been so wet that in the 2 seconds I was on the floor, my jeans were soaked through to my undies.\n\nWhen we got to the office to check out, the same gentleman who checked us in was attending the desk.  He asked how our stay was, and I limited my comments to my recent fall.  He apologized perfunctorily and made a note, but said nothing else.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I am sorry to give this low rating, because the place looks like it could be darling. In fact, when we were checking in, we saw they had received an award in 2009 for being Piuttsburgh's \""Most Romantic Getaway\"" spot from the local independent rag.  Nevertheless we experienced too many frustration, and we will not go back if we find ourselves in the Steel City, nor are we comfortable recommending it to anyone else."
"2","My husband and I went to visit my nephew at Carnegie Mellon.  It was our first time in Pittsburgh, so we wanted something close to him.  The Shadyside Inn was PERFECT for our stay.  We are very, very, well traveled, and are extremely selective about where we stay.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt that we will be staying here again the next time we come back.  In fact we tried, but the dates we wanted were completely sold out :-(\n\nThe location is perfect, and only a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants on Walnut Street.  You don't even need a car.  The Inn is a series of nicely renovated apartment buildings, so they are all equipped with well-stocked kitchens (my husband is a chef so he was very impressed by that).  \n\nThe front desk person was sweet and friendly.  Not only did he check us in immediately, he gave us a \""breakfast bag\"" full of muffins, juices, and granola bars!  Then he told us that he upgraded us to a suite, even tho we only booked a studio.   Well, when we got into our room, not only was it a suite, but it was a 2 BR suite!  I couldn't believe it.  It was bigger than our apartment back home.  Right then and there I wished we were staying longer - like a month!\n\nThe suite had a giant flat screen TV, a big dining area, with room service menu, free wi-fi, and super comfy furniture.  The bed was to die for.  The only thing that didn't go was the older, un-renovated bathroom tiles & fixtures, but it really didn't bother us at all, because the shower water pressure was great.  There is ample parking out back, and the service people out taking care of the gardens and rooms were friendly and courteous.\n\nWhen we checked out, they were renovating the main office, so it's nice to see that they are constantly striving to update and improve.  Checkout took less than 30 seconds.  I handed her my key, and they told me they would email me a copy of my bill, since I used my credit card to book.  Everything went so smoothly, and the staff was so wonderful.  We LOVED our stay here and would come back in a heartbeat!"
"1","Oh Shadyside Inn and suites I wanted to love you I really did, but the longer my stay got the more I just couldn't so its with a little regret that I write this review.\n\nPro's: good space for the price, and free parking. Seems like an oversight but when hunting for a middle priced hotel in pittsburgh, you would have thought by price range of the larger chains pittsburgh suddenly morphed into Paris. Major chain hotels  near downtown are ridiculouly priced and mostly all cheaper hotels are out the way for dirving purposes. Also most hotels offer no free parking, Shadyside suites did.\n\nPrice seems great, but for one thing the comfort level... see further in review,\n\nFairly clean, and renovated, cheap renovations but acceptable for the price of the hotel.\n\nNo issues with service or housekeeping.\n\nNice large space in room for the price, cable tv, and fully stocked kitchen.\n\nGreat Location close to downtown, oakland and the east end.\n\nCons:\n\nNoisy, they cannot help this but the cars whizzing by on fifth ave will not allow you to sleep well in the living room. I mean you cannot even watch television there in the middle of the day well due to car noise either. The bedroom however seemed to dull car noise a little better.\n\nParking lot is a bit cramped can be hard to get in and out of depending on how others park. \n\nHot water, not much of it low water pressure as well. \n\nOk now the deal breaker the mattress: Ours was a Serta 99Z i checked because i felt along the ouside and I could feel the springs nearly poking out the side of it. Because after hurting out backs I suspected the thing had not been manufactored in this decade or possibly last decade and I was right. \n\nHave you heard of a Serta 99z? no me either so I dubbed it the 0 z and moved on, they had placed a memory foam pillow on top of it, which didn't help matters and when we complained it was too soft. We were told oh if you take the memory foam thing off that makes it less soft, and we could have asked for that. Sorry genius at the dront desk but that wont help matters. \n\nI understand hotels cannot always know your preferance of mattress firmness but they can provide sleep number mattresses, or newer mattresses. I thought at first maybe this hotel had not been in business that long, that was why they were you using a 25 yr old mattress. Then I saw the yelp reviews and see that they have been there a few years."
"2","Once a year for the past 10+ years we've been staying here.  You canNOT beat the location.  You can walk to shops and restaurants and the area is safe.  The staff has always been above average.  A few years ago the rooms were rundown but since they have renovated and the rooms couldn't be better.  A hotel doesn't give you that much room - you literally have your our own apartment.  I was there last week because a family member died.  We were having relatives visit us at Shadyside Inn and the staff went out of their way to deliver chairs to our rooms.  Our rooms were cleaned every day and there are very few places that allow dogs - and they do!  Their prices are reasonable and I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in PA.  Thank you Shadyside!"
"1","I'm granting one star because there's no way to give none.\n\nAs I write this, the door to my room is open, and two burly gentlemen are drilling and hammering and drilling and hammering--I just checked, and it's going to go on all day. Evidently, the inn is installing a new lock system, and for some reason it was impossible to wait until I checked out later today. Counting on solitude and quiet, I'd brought work to do, but it's now utterly impossible to concentrate. I stayed here once before and loved it, but this lack of concern and respect sets a a new low."
"1","We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review, but the experience was disappointing. \n\nThe quality of service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).  And the elevator did not work at times.\n\nWe will not stay at this hotel again."
"1","Nothing special about this place. Great location but the facilities are a little tired."
"2","I am in mood. I am reminiscing about my favorite haunts in the burgh. I live in los angeles, one of the tastiest restaurant havens in the world. And yet, i left part of my stomach in pittsburgh. \n\nI loved the calamari for a starter, the talapia in a sweet nutty white sauce, and the apple crisp for dessert. those were just my favs, but i did try other things, everything YUMMY. cool atmosphere and cocktails as well. \n\nFrom my understanding this place has been around a long time, doing their thing. Check it out!"
"2","Comfortable place that is our most frequent and favorite dining spot......if Norm and Cliff ever moved to Pittsburgh, this is where they would hang...........we like all of their food! Finding a place to park is my only complaint."
"2","Came here for dinner on my birthday (back before I turned 21) and also when my parents were in town for dinner.  The food was decent each time, but nothing really standout.  I enjoyed my fish and chips, but my boyfriend didn't care much for his pasta--too rich and overwhelming.  I like the homey decor a lot, though!  It really feels like a neighborhood place.  Coming from the suburbs, I'd never seen restaurants done like that (except tacky imitations).\n\nLuckily for students and other carfree residents, it's on the 71C route and close to the 71A!"
"1","I've been here twice and I'm just not crazy about it.  Nothing is BAD, per se, just not really impressive.  The service is fine and the food is certainly edible, but missing something - at least, their vegetarian food.  When I ordered sweet potato fries, a lot of them came out burnt.  The Big Green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks.  Their French onion soup was pretty good, but when is French onion soup not good?  They have a hot vegetarian sandwich, but it sounds gross.  Does hot hummus and alfalfa sprouts sound good to you?  As for non-vegetarian food, my dad was very satisfied with his hot grilled chicken salad.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back for brunch.  Since it's just around the corner from my new apartment, I'm sure I'll end up going here with my parents fairly often.  I'm not crazy about it, but if they're paying, I'm not opposed to it."
"1","Been there twice in the last year.  The service was mediocre once, and embarrassingly bad the second time.  The food is good; it's Meatloaf-Centric American.  It's a place you'd take your conservative parents.\n\nThat said, the first time I was in, some of the regular customers were being ridiculously outgoing about politics, and decided to group-hate some things I find pretty reasonable.  Didn't seem reasonable to argue with a large group of folks in their regular spot, so, ah, that's that.\n\nIf you can't find plain-to-upscale American food in Pittsburgh, you're really not looking very hard.  Reading another review, I'd be baffled trying to figure out why anyone would take the bus here."
"2","Extensive wine menu and average service.  They have an in-house wine specialist that helps you with your wine selection - impressive. The food is the high point of this place. They always seem to have a great selection of seasonal foods - gnoochi stuffed with sweet potatoes and topped with goat cheese and cranberries. \n\nWhen warm weather gets here, stop by and check out the outdoor patio. It's a nice place for a summertime date."
"2","Great place to have a relaxing lunch / dinner outside in the middle of the hot summer or cool fall - the food is good and the prices are reasonable.  I'm a big fan of the steak salad, although the fact that it has fries in it really does weird me out.  It is most likely just as fattening as a burger, but it sure does taste good and gets me craving it to come back!\n\nThey also have a great wine selection that is worth checking out.  In a pinch (or during snowpocolypse) they will also sell bottles to-go, but they do have to de-cork it for you before you leave, which is midly annoying, but better than nothing."
"1","I met a group of girls here for dinner last night, and my initial first impressions were very positive.  The space was attractive, with a nice bar area and bottles of wine decoratively placed on display.  Some of the wine was reasonably priced, and the wine list included descriptive words below each type, like \""dry, food-friendly, hints of pear.\""  Very helpful to a wine ignoramus like me.  There was only one bartender at 730 pm, and he was quite busy so it was difficult to get his attention.  One of my friends also was given a dirty glass with smudges on it at first, but as soon as we managed to signal the busy bartender, he fixed it quickly.\n\nOur server was very friendly and cheerful.  She didn't rush us, and made good wine recommendations.  We had to ask for water, which I thought was a bit weird since the table was pre-set with empty water glasses.  I just assumed someone would be round with a pitcher, but that was not the case.\n\nWe started with the artichoke dip, which was pretty good - your usual creamy dip with artichoke hearts and spinach.  It was served with some little slices of french bread, and was a pretty decent appetizer.  For my entree, I got the Danish burger, and here's where things took a major tumble.  The burger supposedly had \""herbed caper relish and bleu cheese.\""  Now tell me - how flavorful does that sound?  It sounds pungent, sharp, and just what I was in the mood for.  What I received was one of the most bland burgers I had ever eaten.  Seriously.  What.  Was.  The deal?\n\nIt was cooked the way I asked, and taking the bun off revealed that there was indeed caper relish and bleu cheese on the burger.  But there was a very small amount of it - when I ate a crumble of cheese by itself it was delicious, but on the burger, the flavor just vanished.  The burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef.  I couldn't taste salt, pepper, garlic, anything.  I had to put ketchup on it!  KETCHUP!  Normally that's not weird, but on a burger with bleu cheese and caper relish, I shouldn't need other condiments.\n\nI lost interest in it very quickly, and focused on eating my sweet potato fries.  I should say that those were pretty tasty, and I was happy to spend my time gobbling them up.  I took most of the burger home, and fed it to my boyfriend, who agreed that it was a super boring burger.\n\nMajor bummer.  I considered giving this place a 3 since it's a cute restaurant, the service was good, we enjoyed our wine, my sweet potato fries were hot and crispy, and the appetizer was all right, but UGH that burger!  I can't with that burger.\n\nThat being said, I'd go back for wine and I'd hesitantly try something from another part of the menu, but I'm done with their burgers.  Their burgers are dead to me.\n\nThe hunt for a decent burger in Pittsburgh goes on..."
"2","This was my first time at the Elbow Room at their new location on Walnut Street (previously located on Ellsworth Avenue.) My friend and I met for a low key Friday night dinner, but when we arrived at 6:30pm, to our surprise - it was PACKED!! It was really nice to see it so lively and bustling with a ton of people. It was a 30 minute wait for a table, and in that time we grabbed a drink at that bar. By the time we did that, our table was ready. After we ordered, our appetizer, salads, and entrees were all out within 15-20 minutes. The service was amazing, from our waitress, to even the owner coming out to make sure everything was ok. We ordered the fried zucchini for an appetizer, which was good but I thought the breading as a little bland, a great side salad, and I had the mediterranean pasta for my entree. Everything was better than I had expected it to be and I will definitely be returning for happy hour and dinner, hopefully very soon! 2 thumbs up!"
"1","Well, my update has half of my original rating. Not because of their food, but because of the service. My friend booked her birthday party there this past Saturday night in their tavern room. When we got there, the room that was supposed to be set up for her party and guests was completely full of other restaurant patrons. She had called in advance to confirm party details and they assured her that everything would be fine. Not the case when we got there. The person she set the party up with wasn't working that night, and it took the hostess 15 minutes to find his \""note\"" that was left about the party. It took another hour for them to clear somewhat of an area for the party, which was now squeezed into the bar area. The whole area never fully got cleared out for her party, and we had to share space with people who they had sat in that hour that we had waited for it to clear out. They also put only one server on staff, which was insanity and chaos because there were 30 of us at this party. I think she got 1 out of every 4 drink orders correct. I would still go here to eat for dinner, but I would never recommend it to anyone looking to have a party or event here."
"1","Went to Elbow Room for a nice Sunday brunch experience. It was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly. My girlfriend ordered the album pancakes while I ordered the crab Eggs Benedict.  Her pancakes were absolutely inedible, with such a bizarre after taste that we had to say something to the waitress. The kitchen also forgot to put any hollandaise sauce on my eggs and it looked like a 10 year old had poached them. The asparagus was raw and there were a few bits of crab, so little I thought they had forgotten that too. By the time I got any hollandaise the eggs were cold and the whole plate was ruined. When we said something about the pancakes the waitress apologized profusely and brought out some fresh French Toast, but stated that the cooks also thought something was wrong with the pancakes - - - why did she let us order them, then?? Makes no sense.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and very attentive, but the cooking left a lot to be desired. We won't be going back there for brunch anytime soon. Worst Eggs Benedict experience I've ever had."
"1","use to be a max and erma's and if that bar wasn't low enough it now misses the mark"
"1","I was promised a room full of elbows, and the Elbow Room seriously under-delivered.\n\nAdditionally, I was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection. When I asked our waiter what was on tap, he could not name a single choice. Its not a huge problem for me, but considering this place is somewhat of a pub, it would probably be wise to memorize a few choices. I had the Norman Rockwell Burger which was actually very good. The egg was perfectly fried and the burger was cooked precisely how I requested. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the crappy bun detracted from the burger as a whole, but overall I was happy. The fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course. My lady-friend's turkey-whatever sandwich was okay, nothing to get excited over.\n\nThe food itself deserves 3 stars, but the overall environment felt strange to me, hence 2 stars."
"1","I have continued going back to Elbow Room hoping for a different experience. No matter how many times I order from them they always leave something off my burger. I do not understand how a burger with apple, cheese, and bacon always end up missing at least one of the 3 items. I am just happy it has the burger on it. \n\nSo tired of this place. I have talked to their chefs and managers about this issue and it has never been resolved. If you get takeout from this place I suggest always opening your box before you leave to make sure it is all there."
"1","I have dined at the elbow room twice now. First time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, and believe it or not, it was the worst grilled cheese I have had. I know what you are thinking......how can you mess up grilled cheese? I am still asking myself that question. I gave it another try last night because I did like the decor and the service was good. I thought maybe the cook was having a bad night. I had the Norman Rockwell burger and although it wasn't prepared as rare as I prefer, it was tasty. I was beginning to change my mind about this place until I decided to use the restroom.  Walking into this place, you would never imagine that the bathroom would be filthy. The decor is nice, the service is great, the food is average, and the bathroom is undescribable."
"1","I had brunch here with two of my friends, one of whom had brought her daughter with her.\n\nThe bloody mary was COMPLETELY disgusting.  And there was no alcohol in it.  It was god awful.\n\nMy friends daughter had ordered lox & a bagel, and her bagel was ROCK HARD and cold.  We asked for a softer bagel, and they brought one out.  It was the same bagel, they just stuck it in the microwave.  \n\nMy friend ordered a salad and it was all iceberg lettuce, nothing to spectacular.\n\nI had a reuben and it was ok, but I was so grossed out by the bloody mary I couldn't eat it.  \n\nThe manager could not have been nicer, he comped the bloody mary and asked me how I make them for myself when I'm at home since he didn't think his recipe was that great.  \n\nI'm still so grossed out by that bloody mary i'm never going bac."
"1","\""Bland\"" is probably the key word in describing this place. A local Applebees-type feel.\n\nI was here for dinner one night, and the sandwich I got was unbelievably bland, so was the side of cole slaw. The artichoke dip was ok, but very greasy. The pasta a bit dry and bland as well.\n\nThe reverse happy hour concept from 9PM-11PM is cool. There is an OK number of beers on tap. The service is friendly and efficient.\n\nHowever, the food is sub-par, so I won't be returning even if I were in the area."
"1","I fully agree with reviewers who call the food bland, and overall, I think there are much better dining options for the money in the vicinity.  I have tried a number of items on the menu here and found them to be all underwhelming, despite the fact that their average entree costs nearly $20.\n\nFor example, the hanger steak has come out under-seasoned and chewy, the braised short ribs tasting no better than ones you can easily make at home -- again despite being roughly $20 or more each.  The starters that I have had were also very uninspiring, such as the hummus which is, at best, on par with store-bought hummus.  For a restaurant at this price point, it is simply not worth the money.\n\nFor \""cheap\"" eats in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh, I prefer options like BRGR or Dinette.  At either of those locations, entrees are less expensive while much more consistent and flavorful."
"1","Drinks are good but food sucks. I tried the food multiple times and I think only the french onion soup and salads are descent. The main courses are very low quality."
"2","Wonderful brunch. The food and service was great. The waiters were very friendly and the food wasn't too pricey. Really a great option for brunch."
"1","As we strolled up Walnut Street this morning we were greeted by a large sandwich board sign advertising brunch.  Spirits lifted we raced inside for the sidewalk advertised  breakfast glories...sat down...and were told brunch was only on Sundays. My lil heart fell. \nRegroup. I ordered the half sandwich and chili and my partner in this mess ordered a chop salad.  \nThe chili should be renamed Alpo & Cheddar. The salads are better at Get Go.\nAnd direct quote upon our server checking on us..drumroll....\""From what I see I presume you are okay\"" and a quick exit stage left.\nWe shall not be returning. Even as tempting as the $10 sangria made of pure canned fruit juice appears."
"1","It's a nice enough place with a decent selection of drinks (and a not-bad post-9pm happy hour), but I'd steer clear of the food.  If the portions were large and delicious, the prices would be more than reasonable, but sadly that's not the case.  I've never really enjoyed anything I've eaten here, and the downright terrible burger is what prompted me to write the review warning folks away (\""medium rare\"" came out \""well done\"" and no one noticed or even asked how it was).\n\nSo come here if you want to grab a drink with your friends on Walnut Street.  But I, for one, will be going someplace else first if I want dinner too."
"2","A couple things about happy hour- late happy hour is awesome, martini happy hour is awesome, but the happy hour menu is super limited. For such a delicious dirty martini, though, full price was ok- occasionally. Maybe they keep it off the half off menu so I don't move in. We only had dessert, so I can't comment on rest of the menu- but it all seems relatively well priced. The carrot cake was bomb, but to be fair, it's hard to mess up anything with cream cheese icing. I'll definitely be coming back to get a more rounded experience. But so far it's the bee's knees!"
"1","My wife and daughter and I walked in and were seated immediately by the hostess.  We sat down and browsed the menu and made our selections.  Ten or so minutes passed by as various wait staff passed by our table. At about the fifteen minute mark, without even as much as water service, we got up and left.  The hostess, as well as  the wait staff that we passed by on or way out the door made no attempt  to engage us in any way.  There wasn't much of a crowd there and I don't expect, with this type of service, business to be picking up any time soon."
"1","Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of \""cheers\"" because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad, but she got everything.food wise right. It took awhile to bring our drinks. I split the check with my friend, and she didn't divide the items correctly.I probably wouldn't come here again because it wasn't \""special\"". If I'm coming all the way from Monroeville, then I want more bang for my buck."
"1","The drinks were fantastic... When we could get a waiters attention.  However, the bar closed at 12:00 on a Saturday night.  Furthermore the waiter took almost 20 minutes to sort out our tabs.  I usually love the elbow room, however on this particular night it was impossible to get a drink or pay our tab .  I'm not sure we will be back."
"1","Bad,  very bad.    Ordered Gin and Tonic.....tonic water was as flat as water.   Returned drinks and ordered wine.   Wine was ok but overpriced.    Ordered an omelet which was basically an egg pancake with the omelet stuff dumped on top.     Home fries were undercooked.   Biscuit had overpowering flavor of artificial butter.   \nThe chicken on the salad was entrenched with artificial flavor.    I think this restaurant does not use 'fresh' ingredients and buys a lot of things already prepared and all they have to do is 'heat things up'.    So their lazy way of doing things certainly has lost us as a customer.   Also....the waitress was wearing cologne or perfume...lots of it...her scent lingered on and on.   NO Server should be wearing a scent at work.   I would equate their food with a fast food restaurant.   Not a compliment."
"2","This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!"
"2","I have been to the elbow room a few times.  The food and the service meet good standards.  Do not expect a gourmet, extraordinary menu but it is serves normal American bar/restaurant food.  The Sunday brunch menu is also nice (the Greek omelet is highly recommended if you are into omelets).  The biggest advantage of the place is its location and the atmosphere.  The new venue on walnut has a nice feel; something between a classy, upscale restaurant but at the same time casual, family-oriented.  I always enjoy having a grub here and I will definitely go back many times."
"1","Walking by on a Saturday morning, I was pleased to see that they offered a weekend brunch, and an alternative to the overcrowded and overrated Pamela's next door.  I ordered an omelette for $9 and a fruit plate for $7 and my wife ordered a grilled chicken salad.  My wife's salad was good.  My omelette, however, was inedible -- a round, rock-hard disk smothered in cheese.  In a addition, we ordered a fruit plate for $7 which was a complete embarassment of several tiny pieces of fruit strewn about a plate with a tiny souffle cup of yogurt.  I hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad. I told the server as nicely as possible that it wasn't her fault and I didn't want to appear difficult but I just could not eat the omelette and the fruit plate was really unappealing and overpriced.  She gave me an icy cold look that communicated \""You are a crazy, difficult, demanding jerk,\"" but took the food back and took it off my check.  Upon reading some of the reviews here, it seems like I am not alone."
"2","Always enjoy coming to The Elbow Room. Atmosphere is great. Food is great. Jason was our server. He did an excellent job! Highly recommend asking for Jason."
"2","So... I would have posted pictures, but devoured everything before I could remember, lol. \n\nThe food is AMAZING! The service is great also. Salmon burger, french fries, apple crisps, regular burgers, and the list goes on! I haven't even told you the best part... THEY DELIVER!!!!! Unfortunately, this will be an overweight summer... but a happy one!"
"1","This place is hit or miss. It'll depends on who is in the kitchen, I think, and whether or not management feels like taking the job seriously.  I've had good meals here, and I've had really bad ones. I've had enough bad ones that I try not to go here unless there's no other choice.  I got a piece of fish once that you could drive a nail with. The Rubens are always stringy and it's impossible to take a bite out of the sandwich without dragging all the meat out in one big glob. And I don't think I've seen the same waitstaff here more than once. Big turnover. There's no pride in the service or the food at all.  This place is never been truly \""good\"", things just seem to keep getting worse."
"2","I used this place for a while, but now having moved to Shadyside, I can't see myself making the trip down to Forbes. Anyway, the biggest plus for this place (and why I went there in the first place) is that they have same-day service. In by 11am, done by 5pm. Fantastic! That alone makes it worthwhile.\n\nOn the other hand, they wrote my last name in black permanent marker on the bottom of the button seam (no clue what that's called) every single one of my dress shirts. Why?? This wouldn't be such a huge problem, but they did it on my white shirts that I don't wear tucked in! And the black bleeds through to the front. Not cool at all.\n\nSo, go here if you need a quick turn around, but ask them not to mark up all your clothing!"
"1","Took my boyfriends suit to get dry cleaned, when I picked it up I had to wait a really long time which was petty absurd because I was the only one there and they had 3 employees behind the counter but only 1 doing work. The price was reasonable but when my bf put his suit on, he noticed they had written his name in sharpie inside all the pieces - even the back of the tie. Even though the markings weren't visible, it was sill irritating. \n\nWe found a really awesome dry cleaner (Runners) which was always reasonable, the owner (or manager) was always friendly and remembered your face and name. We did a lot of business here but sadly the Greenfield location closed. \n\nFooters has so many locations in Pittsburgh in convenient locations but it is definitely worth seeking out some other place."
"2","Such a pleasurable experience! Everyone one from Jason at the front desk, to Katherine the stylist's assistant, to Richard the stylist were sweet, attentive, and professional! I came in there with a curly mess of long hair that hadn't been attended to in 9 months, and I left with hair worthy of an Herbal Essence commercial. I couldn't have asked for better service, a better style, or a better stylist!"
"1","I'd heard great things about one of the stylists, Richard, so I booked an appointment.  The wait wasn't bad, maybe 10 minutes on a Wednesday afternoon around 4.  The girl who shampooed my hair was great, but sadly Richard was not.  He made a point to tell me we were going to have a \""professional consultation\"" after my shampoo, which turned out to be an exercise in frustration.  He went on and on about how I was a new \""guest,\"" and he appreciated this opportunity to grow the business.  Then when I told him I was growing my hair out, didn't like anything flippy or layered, was willing to lose some length to clean up the back, and just wanted it to look really polished, it was like talking to a brick wall.  What I got were more layers in the front, and he didn't even touch the back.  Then he had a third person blow dry my hair, which turned it into the Rachel from friends, circa 1997 - huge, like a mushroom.  He kept going on about how great it looked, but all I could say was, \""...It's big.\""  His response was, \""You're not used to brushwork, it's okay, we'll do it how you do at home.\""  Could not have been more patronizing.  And I'm from the DC area; I've been to a few high-end salons in my time, and had a few blow-outs.  It's not brushwork in general that I'm against, it's being made to look like a human lollipop that I take issue with.  So a fourth (!) guy wet my hair again, then Richard put more product in, slicked it down to my scalp, and stuck me under a hairdryer machine.  Then he had the shampoo girl blow dry it out for the second time.  All in all a really frustrating experience - one of those haircuts where you get back to your car and want to cry.  I got the impression that the salon was trying to be high-end, but they're all pretension and nothing to back it up.  I wouldn't recommend Richard or the salon to anyone."
"1","I've since had two more haircuts from Richard. The second haircut was great, but styled horribly. When I left I literally looked like I was wearing a wig from the early '90's. Once I was able to fix it myself and style it totally differently than he intended, I really loved it. The third haircut was just awful: styled awful, looked strange. I just hate it, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm now on the look out for a new haircutting home!"
"2","I've been seeing Richard at Dean of Shadyside for 2.5 years.  There have been some awesome haircuts along the way, and a couple duds.  The duds were just a bit more \""experimental\"" than I would have liked.  Five years ago I might have been more okay with an edgy haircut, but now that I have a \""real job\"", I feel more inclined to have normal hair.\n\nHere's the thing, Richard is an awesome stylist if you give him a lot of leeway and let him do his thing.  If you just want a simple, straight across the back haircut, go to supercuts.  Richard's haircuts are best when you  give just a little bit of direction and then let him do his thing.  My best haircuts have been the ones where I just let him do whatever he feels like.\n\nI have fine, curly hair and Richard really knows how to handle it.  He does a great job thinning it out so that it has lots of definition and doesn't look like a 'fro.\n\nBottom line, Richard is a talented stylist, but he does best when he's given some freedom.  If you're willing to let go, give him a shot.\n\nAlso - Dean of Shadyside has a referral program, you get these cards which entitle new clients to a free haircut (and you get a kickback coupon in the mail).  I get so many random compliments on my hair from total strangers that I've given almost all of my coupons away.  That's like one random-person-compliment per haircut, and that says something."
"1","I went into Dean of Shadyside salon to get my hair colored. My stylist was nice and friendly however that was not the problem that I encountered at this salon. My stylist rushed through the process of coloring my hair as she had another client during the same time as my appointment. In addition, my hair was just left to hang (not pulled/clipped back) while my hair was being colored making the dark hair dye smear over my ears, neck and face. The worst part was checking out. The charge for the hair color was a decent/normal price around $50.00. However this salon charges you extra if you need more color (if you have thick hair). Are you kidding me? On top on that, they also don't include the blow dry, which yes is more money. Not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service. Won't be back ."
"2","I recently took advantage of a Groupon deal that was made available for Dean of Shadyside, and let me tell you-I am hooked! My Groupon provided me with a cut, conditioning treatment, color, and mini manicure (aka polish change) for $50. How could I refuse? \n\nWhile Courtney was not as chatty as I prefer (what can I say, I like to dish...I want some witty banter in return!), she helped me pick a fabulous color toner and gave me the exact cut that I wanted. My hair feels FABULOUS. The manicure was nothing to write home about...because it was just a polish change-which I do basically every other day anyways. But my hair? Amazing. The color is fabulous. The cut is edgy and perfect. And I left with a great deal on some new products. I am already booked for my next visit at the end of the month...right on time to get sexy for New Years Eve. \n\nThey share parking with the Mozart apartment building on the corner of Centre and Aiken, and it's easy to miss. It's easy to miss, but it is right across the street from Shadyside Hospital. Hit the \""dean\"" button on the buzzer and they will let you in. Made me feel like hot stuff.\n\nSide note-be sure to bring cash for your tip-you cannot add tips onto your credit card/debit card, so you must have cash for tips. There is a generic ATM that charges $2, so be prepared.\n\nChatty or not, I have a girl crush on Courtney for making my hair look so hot. Thanks, girl."
"2","My roommate and I refer to Courtney as \""Courtney Copperfield\"" because she is a legit magician! I gave her a picture of the haircut I wanted and it actually looked better than the picture when she was done. She also knew exactly what colors to put together to achieve the shade I wanted for Fall. Sadly, I moved out of Pittsburgh and I know it will be a struggle to find somewhere as fabulous as Dean."
"1","If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service, this is your salon."
"1","Terrible! I purchased a groupon, but after all of the additional fees (upgrade to a higher level stylist because no one included in the groupon was available for a month, etc) I paid full price without full price service. If you make the mistake of going here, bring cash to tip your stylist. The receptionist cannot handle tips at all. They do offer a shady ATM that you can use and pay the surcharge, then put the tip in an envelope in a comment box. Haircut was ok, but certainly not near what I expected after reading the other reviews. I left extremely upset and no one cared. Terrible customer service!"
"1","Just moved to Pittsburgh a week ago and I needed a place to get a few platinum pieces weaved into my more honey-blondish locks.  I know a fair amount about hair, and could have done it myself, but I love the ritual of going to a salon and having 'a girl.'  Dean's was basically the only place I could get an appointment same-day that looked halfway decent.  \n\nI had a Level III stylist who was nice enough, but certainly not a conversationalist.  I don't think English was her first language.  That's no big deal, but a little good cheer would have made it less boring.  Also, I love (LOVE) my former stylist in Michigan so I have high expectations for fun at the salon.  I had no fun at this salon.\n\nDean's is kind of a mid-range pricing scheme.  Not too bad.  I paid $60 for a partial.  \n\nThe concept of the salon is very bland--nothing remotely original about the place.  Judging from the name, I thought it'd be kind of funky (I was thinking Dean of Shadyside as in academic dean and thought it might have a bookish vibe).  They had one interesting product line I'd never seen before, but I can't recall the name.  \n\nI think I'll find a place that's a little more... me."
"2","Love my hair!  I bought a Groupon for a cut and hairline highlights because I was looking for a place that would give me a good haircut.   My hair is naturally curly so I've had more than my share of bad cuts... them they try to style it and it gets worse. Not Dean of Shadyside!  Ally took the time to discuss my the color of my highlights and make sure that I was comfortable with everything before she started (I have only had highlights done once before and they were bad).  The end product was great!   She listened to what I wanted and did it!   This is the first time in a very long time that I didn't leave a salon and pull my hair back.   My next appointment is already scheduled."
"1","The first time I went to Dean, I was content with the haircut I got for about the first three weeks. A men's haircut is pretty straightforward, generally speaking. After about three weeks, though, my hair started looking as though I had just received a bowl-cut - the hair from the top of my head was longer than the hair on the sides of my head, and it was growing down over the sides! The next time I returned, I made an appointment with a different stylist. Again, great haircut at first, but after about three weeks it started happening again, albeit to a lesser degree. The next time I went in, I decided to stick with the same stylist - Erika - as she was friendly (unlike the first, rather quiet and somewhat abrasive stylist) and seemed to be eager to give me a haircut the I liked! I let her know how the previous haircut went wrong, and she actually took what I told her and made changed. Apparently my head is somewhat square-shaped at the top, and if the top is cut a different length from the rest, then it must be done with a narrower section to avoid the issue I'd been having. After all said and done, I left with a great cut that looked great for a solid two months before I went in again. I got one more cut with Erika, and then pre-booked my next cut.\n\nWhen I went in for THIS cut, I got to the front desk for my appointment time, told them I had a 12:15 with Erika, and was then told \""Oh. Erika left. Let's see if we can get you in with someone else.\""\n\nThey didn't call me to tell me that Erika had quit. They didn't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did. I was lucky enough to get in with one when I showed up, but it was back to square one with another haircut-turned-bowl-cut.\n\nIt's no wonder Erika quit - she was too good for the place! Needless to say, I will not be back."
"2","I an very happy with my haircut :) Staff are very polite too."
"1","I've tried to like Dean's several times over the years.  Because if you go there and then don't come back for 9 months they offer you a free haircut.  No joke.  \n\nAnd each time I've gone, my haircut has been.... fine.  Not earth shattering, not life changing.  But just fine.  \n\nI also went to get my nails done for my wedding- because they have a nice big space and my experience there has been.... fine.  \n\nBut I swear, it's like no one there considers it their job to actually make you comfortable.  They go through the motions- they've got their coupons for repeat customers and they kind of offer you beverages and they take you back to your stylist- they act like customer service is really really important.  \n\nBut every time I've gone, I have to fight to get someone to pay attention to me.  Last time I was in (today) I walked in and there were two girls sitting at the front desk.  I tried to get checked in and the girl cut me off and said \""I'll get you checked in in a minute.\"" and then told me to take off my coat and put on a service robe.  Okay.  So I take off my coat and go to where the service robes are, and there's an employee in there hanging up clean robes.  Doesn't look at me or offer me a robe, just takes her sweet time to hang up her robes.  Then she walks out without so much as looking at me.  \n\nSo I go to get checked in, except there are other people at the counter and they check them out while I stand there, now late for my appointment, because no one will check me in.  FINALLY one of the people waiting to check out said \""Oh, I think she was here before me\"" and the lady who initially told me to take off my coat asked my name, and the other lady took me back.  \n\nI go to check out after my haircut (which was fine, by the way, Courtney is lovely and gives a good haircut- and a very relaxing shampoo)- same thing!  They take my info and then do god knows what for a few minutes before telling me what I owe- which in my opinion is way too much for a haircut of this quality ( it was $25 but they took off $20 for the discount plus another $5 for my birthday which means they charge $50 for a haircut?!?).\n\nAnd then, turns out you can't put your tip on your card, which they do not indicate anywhere or tell you about at any time before you show up.  By some miracle, though, I actually had cash on me, though I did have to ask the lady for change.  \n\nOnce I was paid they no longer had any reason to pay attention to me, so they didn't.  Which, you know, fine, but have you ever been to any place of business, let alone a hair salon, where they didn't say goodbye when you left?  I was just at Great Clips with a friend and THEY said goodbye at the front desk when we left.  \n\nSo yeah.  Moral of the story:  They will cut your hair, and it will look fine.  Your stylist may be lovely.  But the overall vibe is weird and the service sucks."
"1","Given the big salon, I think your experience will be highly related to which stylist you chose. I bought a Groupon for a level 3 haircut and moisture treatment. The stylist Ken spent 5 mins for the cutting, 40 mins to blow the hair dry and chatting and forgot the moisture treatment. The technique of the haircut is so poor. There is no layer of the cutting and it is not horizontally on the same level. I think he is not serious about what he did. I will not come for the second time. MCN is much better in this sense. You should definitely try to avoid him as your stylist if you choose to go to Dean of Shadyside."
"1","Pros: convenient location in Shadyside, sufficient lighting for the mood\n\nCons: Crowded, full of frat-boy types, bartenders would kick everyone out at closing time\n\nPerhaps, I didn't have a great experience because I got dragged here against my will.\n\nBut it was unbearably crowded and loud.  The kind where it's most likely that you'll spill someone's else's drink.  It was more than once that I heard glass breaking.  It's a kind of place you would go to meet random people than a place you would go to just hang out with friends. \n\nMy friends enjoyed their drinks, so I grant the bar that.  At closing time however, the bartender yelled that we had to get out since it was closing.  They turned on the bright lights, cut the music and stopped the heat to force us out.\n\nSo I might not be the target audience.  This is my friend's favorite bar.  I am not sure why.  The frat-boy like atmosphere may be it, but I have always preferred the low-key type bars."
"2","Good Food, Good Beers, Better Prices.\n\nTry the Patio outback, you'll love it."
"1","First of all the website, as I was told, \""has been down for 4 years\"" - even though it is very up. The specials and menu prices are apparently wrong.\n\nMy friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50.\n...really, it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass, it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place, and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city. \n\nThe guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising, and it's a dick move, Mr. William Penn."
"2","Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.  \nPreacher Haggard/Twinkie Ted\nWilliam Pen Tavern before 10 p.m. /after 10 p.m.\n\nYes, there are two William Penn Taverns.  Two personalities.  \n\nOne that is a local bar with a cast of characters hanging out, reading the paper, making jokes, all on a first name basis.  Good bar food.  \n\nThe other is hormone fueled meat market kind of place for the under 25 crowd.  \n\nAnyway, both are fine institutions, depending on your flavor.  But make sure you pick the right one.  \n\nI'm personally in bed by 10.  I do like the \""south jersey cheese steak\"" an awful lot."
"1","Great food and normally great atmosphere, but today thus music was the nastiest hardcore rap that was just offensive. How many F-bombs can you realistically listen to while eating lunch and watching sports. Dropped 2 stars from what I would last night whenit used to be my favorite place in shadyside."
"1","Weirdest nights ever.\nWormhole tequila black-out.\nToo crowded/hot/cold.\n\n(b)"
"1","The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life."
"1","Probably the worst bar in Shadyside to go on Friday/Saturday nights. Waaay too crowded and loud. The clientele sucks - it's people in their mid to late-20's desperately trying to cling onto their college years by being loud and obnoxious. \n\nIt does have a nice back patio that is heated during the winter and smoking is permitted, which is nice. If you are there on a week night, it might not be so bad.\n\nDrink prices aren't anything special and cocktails aren't that strong.\n\nI'd venture a guess that this is a good hang-out spot during sporting events. It feels very sports-bar oriented.\n\nI would say this is a good bar to go with a large drunk group, and that's it. If you are by yourself or in a small group, Cappy's or Mardi Gras would be much better IMO."
"1","It's a sports bar... I've heard the wings were good, but the bad hip-hop was too loud to be worth staying for more than one glass"
"2","If you are looking for a good place to catch a game and have some pub food and drinks with a Pittsburgh flavor, this is your place."
"2","Fries: 5 stars \nCheesesteak 5 stars\nno non alcoholic beer 0 stars\nLocation 4 stars\nInterior:  2 stars\nBonus points for service and longevity"
"2","What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get"
"1","This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best, less than mediocre breakfast. Pamela's was closed and we were really hungry. Service was slow but they were nice about it. I don't plan to return and would choose an alternative."
"2","Best bar on Walnut.\nGo here anytime of day,\nThey will have your fix.\n\n(b)"
"1","Can't comment on food since I was just in for beers.  \n\nOkay crowd, friendly bartender, okay beer selection, but it's pretty tacky, and not really in a good way.  Looks like the last time any money was put into the place was maybe 1979."
"1","Crappy's is more like it... sorry I could NOT resist!\n\nThis place is very below average.  The bar is small, good luck getting a seat, it's normally filled with regulars, who I have a sneaking suspicion drink for a reduced rate ;)   Also, the food is blah; they advertise that it is healthier because it is all baked. Um, this results in super fattening foods baked.. this does not mean it is healthy by any means, who do they think they are kidding?? LOL\n\nAnyways, as other reviewers have mentioned the decor is 1975 and wicker all over.  \n\nWith so many options in Shadyside, I don't see any reason to go here."
"2","I could be considered a Cappy's regular.\n\nI love this bar and I'm a little bit obsessed with their Sonoma Turkey wrap--try it, it's very good! \n\nWednesday is Trivia Night at Cappy's at it gets PACKED.  You must be in the bar by 7:30 to get a table, and even then it's iffy bc what the other regulars have started showing up that early and eating dinner before trivia. \n\nIt's not the cheapest place to drink at; it looks like a dive but it's not priced like one.  the food is good, the bartender is great, and it attracts a crowd of nice people!"
"2","I was surprised how good the food was. Great service very friendly people."
"1","How does this place survive in the middle of Walnut Street?  I understand how people like to wait in line for hours for breakfast on a Sunday but I WOULD NOT do it for a place like this.  Given, our first mistake was going for breakfast at a place labeled a \""dive bar\"" on yelp---but still.  Perhaps the wait wasn't meant to be an hour but our waitress definitely FORGOT OUR ORDER and we sat there wondering what could be so tricky about some eggs and toast.  \n\n...one hour and one complaint later...\n\nThe food arrives.  Hot sauce was more difficult, took two requests before it came.  Of course I arrived last and ordered 30 min after everyone else but my food came first.  The food is basic and inexpensive, you get what you pay for.  In summary my Shadyside friends, unless it's a beautiful day and you just want to sit outside (their only plus is they have a few outside tables), keep on going down Walnut for some better options."
"1","Avg food, too salty."
"2","Cappy's is a rarity on Walnut Street: it's as close to unpretentious as you'll ever get in this affluent and often snooty shopping district.  As others have noted, it's a dive bar that happens to serve pretty decent food; my wife thinks that the Big Mountain sandwich is to die for (and I'd agree).  The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places (Shady Grove, I'm looking at you).\n\nI know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols.  I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear (or are made to wear) at some other places to be rather insulting -- these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area.  So thumbs up, Cappy's, for treating your female employees with some respect!\n\nMy wife and I moved away from the Shadyside area a few months ago.  Cappy's is the one thing we miss.  Big Mountain forever!"
"1","I came\nHere for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place, I was .... Starters food is nothing outta the ordinary,,one funny thing that stood out was when we asked our server if they served any other meats aside from pork based meats she responded BACON! And no not turkey bacon... So clearly lil off there...  Other then that we order common breakfast .. Which was ok... I had the western omelette with turkey sausage ... The peppers and the onions were not sliced small enough and were overpoweringly huge ... Lil less On that lil more on the egg,,.. Which I wonder if the eggs were made from liquid base out of a carton ... Yeah so place was ok if u wanna eat in desperation ..."
"1","In my opinion, the is a prime example of a bad Shadyside bar. It's right on Walnut, too small, always too crowded, and I feel like I'm a 21-yr old college student when I go out there. It's miserable to be there on the weekend when it's so crowded because it's such a small space. The only reason I'm giving this bar 2 instead of 1 star is because the karaoke on Fridays (if you can handle the people and the crowd) is pretty good- although there are half a dozen better places to karaoke in Pittsburgh. Furthermore, I have sat on the patio table for a nice chill happy hour once watching the craziness of Walnut Street happen in front of me- which was oddly relaxing."
"1","Horrible service. Waited 50 minutes and had no food and had to ask continuously for more coffee. Don't come here"
"1","I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go."
"2","Yum! I just picked up a cookie platter ($32...see photo) for a party and it looks awesome. Can't wait to have my guests drool over the buttery goodness that are Prantls' cookies. \n\nOther than the treats, this place makes some really decent bread. I've tried it a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed. If you live in Shadyside, make sure to check this place out.\n\n...oh and they sell Enrico's biscottis. Can't go wrong with those!"
"2","Come here for the jelly sandwich cookies. BEST jelly sandwich cookies ever. they're round, 2 layers, powdered sugar, and you can see the jam in a little cut out circle on the top layer. Their \""burnt almond torte cake\"" is supposed to be really famous, but i always got distracted by the cookies..."
"2","Oh. My. God. So. Good."
"2","first, i'd like to note that i'm so ocd i had to change the name from \""prantls\"" to \""prantl's\"" because there IS an apostrophe there! now i can write my review.\n\nthe service is so-so, seeing as i had one girl who had no idea what goods they had to offer me with the keyword i gave her (cinnamon, obviously) and the cash register broke as soon as she swiped my card..adding another 10 minutes to the trip, but all in all, i'm am very pleased with what i left with.\n\none chocolate sour cream cup. different, definitely, with a nice crunch. but i wasn't too sold (i'm not really a chocolate pastry kinda person..unless it's chocolate mousse or flourless chocolate cake or has the words \""molten center\"" in its name).\n\nthe pecan tassies. OH LORD. these miniature tarts are 85 cents of pure joy. i bought three. one wasn't eaten until several days later, and even though it was cold from my refrigerator, it was just as soft as the day i bought it. perfect amount of pecan filling (and sweetness) to fluffy pastry foundation. NOM.\n\none poundcake. my biggest apprehension about buying poundcake in bakeries is the fact that sometimes they are laced with lemon flavoring. i hate lemon flavoring. this poundcake had none of that nonsense. perfectly baked, perfectly golden, and firm but moist days later.\n\nand, of course, the almond torte, which is essentially their yellow \""scrap batter\"" cake, creamy custard, and homemade buttercream formed into a little log and rolled through loads of secret-recipe-toasted almonds. it isn't heavy or too sweet at all, and holds up very well if you're traveling. in fact, prantl's is so famous for them, you can order them online! i'm a firm believer in absence makes the heart grow fonder, so i'll just wait until the next time i'm in the area to have another.\n\nthe treats here are definitely worth taking the next week off to exercise and detox on veggies (as i sit here, eating broccoli)."
"2","I'm not really a dessert person, but I was going home to visit and I always like to bring a little bit of Pittsburgh home with me so I stopped in for some goodies. I got an assortment of their mini pastries which was perfect because you get to sample a little bit of everything. Everyone was impressed. In fact, so impressed that I'm not allowed home without a Prantl's box in my hand.\n\nThe burnt almond torte with vanilla icing is simply to die for. I've had it several times and it's always been moist and an explosion of nutty goodness with every bite. Let me stop myself... this is starting to sound dirty.\n\nIn addition to wonderful pastries, they also offer a decent selection of breads and rolls which are tasty as well, but I wouldn't go out of my for them."
"2","Yumster in my Tumster!  I first got introduced to Prantl's a few years ago when I lived in Shadyside.  I tried their decorative cookies and I was hooked.  Since then I've tried many of their delectable pastries and some noteworthy ones include the decorative cookies, almond torte, and pecan tassies - I'm sure everything else is also wonderful!\n\nI'm so happy they recently opened up their downtown location, now I don't have to worry about hours of operation b/c I work so close to them downtown, but I still think fondly of the Shadyside location.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place for a quick sugary snack or if you need to buy pastries for a group of people.  It is more expensive than some other bakeries, but I think this is the type of place where \""you get what you pay for\"" is applicable."
"2","White chocolate raspberry cup, chocolate peanut butter bar, burnt almond torte, oh my!"
"2","This is always a treat... the beloved burnt almond torte lives up to the hype and is never a disappointment.  Seasonal items like pumpkin gob is enjoyable as well.  Prices are affordable, though you may need to go elsewhere for the perfect coffee to pair with your dessert :D."
"2","If you have not tried their Burnt Almond Torte you must comehere! These are like crack, get one for someone's birthday if they love almonds, they'll love you for sure! They are frozen so make sure you take it out of the fridge a little bit ahead of time before serving, it'll be a huge hit for any parties or holidays!"
"2","Wow! Their burnt almond torte is a Pittsburgh staple, and the few other things that I've tried from them have been equally delicious! I highly recommend checking out this bakery."
"2","They have the best Burnt Almond Torte, so Good!   And if you like lady locks their the best I've had also.  Another of my favorites are the little cake cups they make .  There are a variety, like Burnt Almond Torte, Cookies and Cream, Pumpkin cheesecake, Vanilla Raspberry, German Chocolate, and so on.  Its the perfect miniature dessert!\n\nFor my daughters wedding I ordered five dozen of these for the cookie table. They were a nice addition to the cookies and display beautifully.  They were a Big Hit!"
"1","Meh is right. My whole family is in love with Prantl's enough so that they convinced me to get my birthday cupcakes from there... First of all. They don't have cupcakes they have these little mini cakes that cost an arm and a leg, and are mostly fluffed up icing...bleh.\n\nThen, they aren't even that nice! My mom ordered the cakes, and I didn't know what name they were under... I understand that you have a line, but there is no reason to tell me i am wasting your time, when I am obviously buying something. MAYBE they could have know which order was mine by my telling them what was in it, but nope they needed the name. So I had to guess through a few before I got it BFD! \n\nRude, crowded, and most importantly not that great!"
"2","Prantl's is my favorite bakery.  I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and I've always gotten my birthday cake here (well over 2 decades worth of cakes!).  Prantl's always has a place in my heart.  After the change in ownership, the bakery has seemed to gone downhill a bit.  The most obvious was the increase in prices.  Still a great place for baked goods! Try the Burnt Almond Torte if you haven't yet!"
"2","I don't even like cake, but, the best dessert I have ever had is the Burnt Almond Torte from Prantl's! It is so delicious, nothing compares!"
"1","Nothing stood out, including the famous burnt almond torte."
"1","Nope. Sorry, I grew up in pgh. Heart of a true pittsburgher. But my gosh. One word for prantl's: crisco. Seriously, my arteries hurt after eating a desert from this place. Not half as good as a few of the French etc bakeries around. Why waste your cardiovascular health on this place--go get gelato next door and you'll be better off!"
"1","I had such a discouraging experience today at Prantl's.  A girl offered to wait on me, but then walked away without filling my order.   I waited several minutes, and then spoke up to get waited on.  It really wasn't worth the wait.  Pay attention to the other reviews on here about rude staff.  I will not be returning."
"1","Almond torte cake is way too overhyped.  I ordered one after seeing an article on Huffington Post so with a description like that who wouldn't want to try it!?  It's a diabetics worst nightmare, sugar overload. The filling in the middle had a bland taste, nothing special about it. Maybe it's because I ordered the cake and had it shipped to MD that it tasted bad.  People raving about this cake should try middle eastern or Greek bakeries! I gave a two because they have great customer service when emailing back."
"1","If you want to get pastries while being yelled at by the staff and treated like dirt, this is the place for you."
"2","Prantl's very disappoints me. My favorite is the mini version of their famous burnt almond cake. They somehow compact all the flavor of their sheet cake into one little cupcake and do not skimp on the burnt almonds as well as the icing. Some of the cupcakes are too sweet for me but they please my friend so it is just a matter of preference for sweetness."
"2","Very good doughnuts! Only purchased the glazed but if you heat it up it's oh so good. Also, the cinnamon roll was delightful. Not a fan of their cookies, but hey everything else is very good. If you have a sweet craving, this is definitely a top spot to come pig out at."
"1","Like many others,  I saw the Huffpost article calling Prantl's burnt almond torte the best cake in America.   Being a pastry chef myself,  I had to try it.   I was not impressed.   The cake itself is light, fluffy,  and pleasant enough (which is the only reason I didn't go for one star),  but the filling was,  well,  if I didn't know it had filling I wouldn't have been able to detect any from the taste.   The frosting was average bakery fare (which,  to me,  is a below average taste).   I did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping.   I ate one slice,  and gave the rest away.   Might be fine to serve with coffee,  etc if you are a local,  but definitely not worth the price and shipping.  I doubt this is even the best cake in Pittsburgh,  much less the entire USA.   I wonder which Prantl's family member has a friend at Huffpost?"
"1","While I still like the almond torte, I just can't justify my original rating when the overall selections are just subpar. After trying a larger selection of their baked goods, especially the mini cake cups, I realized they all look delicious but when you bite into them, they're really dry and full of generic cake frosting. \nIf you're still tempted to get one,  go with the tiramisu since it has the redeeming factor of having a strong coffee flavor."
"1","I really wanted to like this bakery! I came in with high expectations, I'll admit, because I thought I had heard good things about it. I bought about four different pastries to sample with a friend so we could eat them with our coffee across the street. Though the presentation of the treats were lovely, every single one I picked out was sickeningly sweet and tasted the same as the next. Far too much frosting on each pastry and we only could finish one small pastry between the two of us. Overall, unimpressed. However, it probably doesn't help that I had just come back from Austria which arguably has the best pastries in the world!"
"2","So glad I popped in here! I love local bakeries and this one is tremendous! The almond torte is too die for! Also sampled the cookies and cream, red velvet and peanut butter. Ranked:\n1. Almond torte\n2. Red velvet\n3. Cookies and cream\n4. Peanut butter (wasn't anything super special, but the flavors above were superb!)\nI binge are three & didn't feel guilty."
"2","Best doughnuts in Pittsburgh. \n\nI generally pass on other baked goods. Mediocre bread.\n\nGenerally unfriendly staff, but Walnut St. attracts pretty arrogant customers - so it makes sense."
"1","Horrible service. I have never been treated so poorly in a cafe. The coffee wasn't spectacular, and it was fairly expensive for what it was. Head down to Starbucks or the Coffee Beanery."
"1","I see people sitting in Jitters' chairs outside all the time and I like the decor so I really, really want to like this place but the first time was the last time. The service was horrible and their coffee didn't taste great. I waited for ten minutes at least before the two people manning the cashier/bar before I was paid attention to and serviced as they were busy chatting with one of their friends who had stopped in. After getting my coffee, they were low on the sugars and milks and other fix-ins so was not pleased even further, especially for what I paid for a small coffee."
"2","Big fan!  First time i have ever been to this place, and the milkshake I got was delicious.  My mother also got a frozen coffee, and I think I wound up drinking all of it for her.\n\nThe cookies that were there also were great.  I am not sure whether they cooked them there fresh or not, but they were delicious.  \n\nDefiantly the best stop my mother and I had while we were on Walnut street, and i would venture back to the place in a second.\n\nPS the wait staff was also very pleasant and kind."
"2","Best coffee on Walnut. Ice cream is excellent. Like the other commentators, I feel the service can be hit or miss, mostly because the lack of a clear location to form a line, but it is generally excellent. The venue isn't as cool as Coffee Tree, but the staff are always friendly, and again, the coffee is better. This is my go-to coffee place in Shadyside."
"2","Awesome staff, quick and accurate service, great tasting coffee and free wifi... Umm, what else do you need?  I avoid the other coffee spots on Walnut either because the staff ain't so hot or it's always jam-packed.  Jitters is cozy and clean, check it out if you need a quiet little place to work or study.  The baked stuff always smells delicious, but I have yet to indulge..."
"2","I generally hate flavored coffees, but I always enjoy the flavored coffees here, especially the Hazelnut and Coconut when they are featured.\n\nThe remodel makes the place much more inviting than it was in the past, and I love going in the mornings and seeing all the regulars. \n\nIt's definitely comparable to Coffee Tree Roasters a few storefronts down, and definitely better than Starbucks. Fun spot for studying I would imagine, but those days are behind me thank goodness."
"1","This place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners. It used to be simple to buy coffee. They used to have a white mocha but not anymore. I miss the old owner of the place. \nBut still support small caf\u00e9s!!!"
"1","Pamela is a bad representation of this location! Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this \""employee.\"" I will not return."
"1","I was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends I traveled all the way from Milwaukee to see. Upon arrival, the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often. We don't have many Bruegger's in Wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the least.\n\nIt began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread. The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel. I politely stated my preference and moved along. The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got. I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees. The cashier responded with, K..... I asked okay? and he responds with, I need to know what size.... I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he's bummed to be working on new years.\n\nThen, when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it, which I politely asked for it without, yet was interrupted. The man literally says, \""Ma'am I don't know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD. Like I'm sorry... WHAT?! the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato.. pretty sure that's impossible to get confused with. I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too. He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn't so rude when we were paying I probably would've shrugged it off. I had too much pride though.\n\nTHEN, he comes up to me and says MA'AM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly. You shouldn't do that next time. K. Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a Bruegger's.\n\nAnd to put this into perspective, I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone. It sucks but it's not my fault...."
"2","I love love love this store. It's a mecca of kooky gifts, books, cards, calendars, tshirts, jewelry, candles... pretty much everything you could ask for. I've spent over an hour just browsing, and around the holidays or birthdays, it's the best place to go if you have no idea what to get. You can pick up anything from a barista action figure to chocolate body paint to the complete set of Harry Potter hardback books. And don't forget the fizzy bath salts or the stick-on mustaches. You'll be hard pressed to NOT buy anything before you leave."
"2","Despite the kooky spelling, Kards Unlimited is a great place to shop for a gift. The card selection is extensive, so if you go there in search of a card you're unlikely to head home empty-handed. Even better, there's a wide assortment of knick-knacks and books that are perfect as gifts or impulse purchases for yourself. It's easy to lose track of time as you wander up and down the narrow aisles."
"2","Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING), including: cards, hand puppets, necklaces, books, etc... Kards Unlimited seems to take great care in choosing store products for sale. Definitely my favorite store on Walnut."
"2","If you are looking for an outstanding comedy gift, this is the place for you.\n\nAlso: a strategically hip book selection, high quality puppets, a wall of giggle-worthy novelty shirts and a jewelry case.  Oh, and KARDS.\n\nFound along the wall: bacon band-aids, insta-Irish accent mouth spray, famous philosopher finger puppets, librarian action figure, vulgar piggie banks, zombie plastic animals, etc.  A tiny sampling of the silliness."
"2","They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back, but I've usually come here to browse the books (lots of Kurt Vonnegut) or the stationary and other gifts like that (notepads like \""While you were out\"" but with snarky commentary). Not only do you have a ton of options here, but they're very well curated options. One of the very best gift shops around!"
"2","A door sign reads \""hiring enthusiastic, energetic and humorous employees\"" , so I walk-in. Immediately my expectations are exceeded as a lady behind the desk responds to a radio call from the staff upstairs announcing that her radio (which is strapped to her body) vibrates every time someone calls her and she \""kinda likes it\"". I couldn't help but laugh out loud the first 30 seconds I walked through the door.\n\n Super savvy, humorous and fun: This is one novelty shop you don't want to pass up! I left with unique childrens books & hand puppets for my son, silly sticky notes for my secretary's desk, witty comic novels, and an irresistible coin pouch. It's more than shopping in here, it's a whole experience. Go in, get lots for awhile..."
"2","kards unlimited is similar to pulp in dc in that it features offbeat gifts and unique cards, but adds jewelry and literature to the mix.\n\nwhile i've found gems here in terms of cards, i really had to *search* for them, unlike other stores where i find so many awesome cards i don't know which to pick..and end up leaving with seven birthday cards, spending more money than anticipated, and no money for food*. the back area has more mainstream cards by hallmark and shoebox (read:: cheaper), as well as posters, gift bags, and ribbons.\n\nthe gift selection are great and span from make-your-own-porno kits (do you like to do it yourself?) to cookie cutters, noveltees**, journals, children's toys, and items only locals would understand and find amusing.\n\ni appreciate the space dedicated to graphic novels, the corridor of books, n'at***, but this place is brimming with so much product, it's damn near impossible to navigate through the twists and turns, even when you know exactly what you're looking for and where it is.\n\nstill, stopping by is a must when on walnut.\n\n---\n*priorities, people. at least all my friends will have epic birthday cards!\n**seewhatididthere.\n***i'm basically a local now."
"2","What more can I say about Kards Unlimited that hasn't already been stated?  The reviews are glowing and well-deserved!  More than just stationary and cards, Kards Unlimited is locally-owned in Shadyside and has a quirky selection of everything from books, jewelry, toys, posters, games, bath/body, and novelty gifts.  I have found many a birthday and Christmas presents here, as well as plenty of knick-knacks for myself.  Since I moved from Pittsburgh, I haven't been back, but I am going to make a point to visit next time I'm in town!"
"2","Large selection of unique/cute-tastic gifts.  Humerous knick-knacks/books galore.  Very adorable and staff was very pleasant.  Looking forward to going back again."
"2","I found myself in the Pittsburgh area this Christmas season on a quest for an ornament to exemplify our trip and mark the year.  Of course I immediately turned to Yelp for help and Kards Unlimited popped up to the top of the list as a place to find ornaments.  A quick read of the reviews, a tap on the directions button and I was on my way. \n\nI was there two days before Christmas and the store was all a buzz. There was a line halfway through the store which moved quickly. \n\nThis store has tons of choices. Books, cards, toys, jewelry, knick knacks and - ornaments. The first one to catch my eye was two turtle doves. It wasn't what i was looking for but it did satisfy another quest I am on.  I also liked a set of decorative yet functional measuring spoons. I thought it would make a nice ornament. \n\nThey displayed their collection of ornaments with fishing line tacked to the ceiling with plenty of \""ask for assistance\"" signs.  I also noticed a sign that explained the meaning behind their pickle ornament but unfortunately they were out of these.  Had they had these in stock, I suspect my quest would have been complete. \n\nThe sales Team was helpful and polite without rushing even when the store was full. The shelves were neat and the store had a pleasant atmosphere. If I lived in the area I would definitely be a regular.\n\n[On the Second Day of Christmas my true love gave to me... Two Turtle Doves\nDecember 2102 Yelp Challege]"
"2","Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!\n\nFrom Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.\n\nIt may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. \n\nThe structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house'?) is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.\n\nWhere this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?\n\nThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.\n\nThere is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back)."
"2","I met a friend for high tea on a weekday so we were the only ones there which we didn't mind at all given that we both brought our two year old children. We were served by Chef Jackie who I found to be friendly and informative. I was very impressed with the large selection of tea that included both loose and bagged options. We were told we could try as many as we wanted. \n\nI must admit I was a little disappointed with the quantity of sandwiches given. We were served an egg salad sandwich, a ham with avocado, and a take on a BLT which was bacon, tomato, and julienned spinach on top served on a piece of French bread. I wanted more. The second plate had fresh fruit and two scones- citrus and vanilla cream. Both were delicious but small in size. The final plate had a brownie, sponge cake, and small cupcake. Everything was delicious but I would have rather have had another sandwich or two over the last plate and larger scones. All of this cost $21pp."
"2","Absolutely adorable!  On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!\n\nThis is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!\n\nLet's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a \""ladies who lunch afternoon\"" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!\n\nThe tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!\n\nThe one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  \n\nI've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  \n\nThere were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!\n\nThe last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??\n\nI can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!"
"2","Amazing!\n\nI recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. \n\nA++++!!!"
"2","I've never had the pleasure of staying here but this is where my boyfriends mom stays when she is in town. They've been very nice to accommodate my boyfriend and I even though we are not staying so I've had a few breakfasts here. They food is always delicious- usually a sweet or savory option plus a classic eggs, toast, meat, bread. The French toast is delicious. The bacon is so yummy crispy delicious. Coffee here is really good! \n\nThey have a beautiful back patio and a station with coffee and tea out all the time. So I've spent a few afternoons enjoying that. All the staff has been very gracious to us."
"2","Went for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time!  The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!\n\nService is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee and/or tea!\n\nAll the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  \n\n\nThey also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!"
"2","First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING"
"1","Didn't havana go out of biz? I think this is the place with the purple awning. If not, oops! This place is OK. It does have a swanky feel and the martini's are OK but overall it is nothing special. Usually the place is very empty compared to the other bars on Ellsworth."
"1","Tokyo Japanese Food Store is the only Japanese grocery in the area with a nice selection of produce, fish and processed foods.  Not all, but many things are overpriced, and I would check out Lotus (Asian market) in the strip district for certain items such as sauces, noodles, etc.\n\nThey are known to sell things past expiration dates: sometimes in the form as a \""sale\"" without explicitly notifying the customer of the condition.  Now, I don't have a problem with buying slightly expired non-perishable (boxed, canned) foods for less... but I expect an honest business.\n\nMany of their raw fish look discolored and old, making me ponder the honesty of the packaging dates...\n\nIn the end, many of the Japanese items can only be attained here, in Pittsburgh - having a small, but formidable selection to suit your needs.   I would just be weary with expiration dates and the perishables they sell."
"2","This is a pricey Japanese grocery store with a wide variety of goods.  I know it better as our Saturday go-to place for BENTO BOXES.  Oh yes, they are so good.  They are made fresh daily by the nice Japanese mom and pop that own the place.  They make sushi as well and it is expensive but it really does taste a million times better than the Giant Eagle stuff.  They also sell SASHIMI grade fish so we tried our hand at sashimi cutting one afternoon as well."
"2","The bento lunches made by the owners at Tokyo Japanese Food Store are the bomb!! They satisfy any Japanese food craving that I might have. They typically either have something fried or grilled along with a small salad, rice and some other tiny sides, which can be found in the fridge in the back of the store.\n\nIf you want to make any type of Japanese food this store would have anything that you would need though a little pricey. However their fresh fish is out of the world if you want to make your own sushi or sashimi. I also bought the largest carrot that I have ever seen (for under a buck!) to go with a cold soba noodle dish that I was making. \n\nYou won't regret popping in here as the owners take pride in their shop and keep it clean and all food fresh though note there is a $10 minimum for credit card."
"2","I was looking for something Japanese around me but had no luck until I came across this place, the prices are fair. I don't understand why people are complaining about the price, it's coming from japan! Of course it will be more than the American junk candy. The food is very fresh and extremely good for the price, I bought a big list of stuff and I would buy out the entire store if I had the money. They are very kind and nice, polite and funny. They are willing to help you out and they give you a nice verity of food and items for a little shop they are. I would highly suggest going there, the food is healthier for you and isn't much more than our typical everyday food. They have certainly got me wanting to go back for more."
"2","I like coming here with a group of people. I think this place may be able to claim they have the cheapest prices in Shadyside. Although many have said that this is pretty much a 'meathead' joint/sausage fest, I think the same could be said of other shadyside bars (william penn, doc's, etc.) \n\nI give the saloon four stars because it's near my house, has cheap drinks, and plenty of space. Usually dead on the weekdays."
"1","This bar smells like a smoky urinal cake, all the time.\n\nI only go in to buy six packs.  The bar staff seems nice enough.  It def seems like a frat crowd.\n\nThey get 2 stars only bc there is a skee ball machine."
"1","I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that."
"2","So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe's.  (Note: The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ doesn't stock dry beans).  So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods (see past review).\n\nI have been to the South Hills GE Market District before.  I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things.  Thus is the experience of GE Market District.  You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels.  AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans.  Fantastic!  They give you a map of the store, which is truly needed, because the variety and stock is endless.  The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic.  Making a left out of the parking lot is pretty difficult.  I enjoy these new Giant Eagle grocery-monopoly attempts."
"1","The nicest full-range grocery I've ever seen.  With, well, a catch.  \n\nIt's the flagship store for the Giant Eagle chain, and they're strongly competing against the Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, both less than a mile away.  They stock a large number of quirky items you normally would only see at specialty stores, and the produce section is amazing.  The employees in the produce section are also amazing, as many of them can spout off a recipe for any particular item they sell, with a story and a smile.\n\nThat said, the traffic in and out of this place is pretty rough, and the prices on random items are much higher than you might expect, while the average price of items are actually pretty darn good.  Hummus is ridiculously expensive.  Juice is cheap.  Dunno.\n\nEvery time we go here, we come out highly stressed, which sucks.  The parking lot, traffic, and lines all make for a bad time, so I shop elsewhere unless I really need something that other places don't stock."
"2","Dude, the other reviewers were NOT kidding about the parking.  I'm not a big fan of carrying orange juice up hills in the rain, but I think it would be worth it to not have to attempt to park in that insane asylum known as the giant eagle parking lot.\n\nGiant eagle pita chips lose to Trader Joe's.  They got groceries though, lots of groceries!  I like being able to buy marketplace hummus dip AND toilet paper.  This place might beat out trader joe's for me for regular grocery trips, when I have to buy like, lettuce, and shampoo."
"1","Drama, Drama, and More Drama.\n\nThis review is for the event planning/wedding cake departments only.  I actually like the rest of the store.\n\nWe had previously arranged for an appointment to talk with the cake department, but when we arrived, we were told that the cake decorator had left for the day without plans to return.   We were then shuttled to talk with the event planning department about cake pricing options.   The event planner was cold, and odd, and definitely not in a good mood.  (For brevity and to protect her anonymity, I'll call her stormy.)\n\nStormy then gave us a wedding cake catalog with decorating ideas and pricing.  This is a bit of an overstatement, actually, since they make it intentionally difficult to figure out the price, hiding charges in five or six components and not being clear about any of them.\n\nI went to ask for help from stormy, but imagine my surprise when I found she was busy frantically scribbling a letter to Giant Eagle H.R. about how she absolutely can't get along with another person in her department and how they were always cold and frosty with each other and storming in and out of workplaces when they were around each other.  I didn't see the whole letter, but that was the gist of it.  As I was trying to ask a question, stormy excused herself and said she \""had to get something for us.\""   She took the hand written letter away and came back a good while later, having delivered her letter but not with anything to help us with our search.\n\nEventually, a replacement cake decorator came to our table with samples (good cake, by the way.)  The replacement decorator apologized for the \""drama in the department,\"" which I appreciated.  We asked her to help us decipher the pricing, and she gave us some quotes, but then stormy said those quotes were no good, and she would have to look them up in her book.  And then stormy herself became confused and couldn't figure out how much a particular cake would be, since they seem to have recently instituted a more expensive pricing structure.\n\nBetween the two employees, they weren't sure if filling was extra or not, and if it was extra, much it would cost.  Same with whether the cake structure could be modified, and if so, how much that would cost.  They weren't sure how many servings were in a particular cake, (which seems to have changed recently) and thus, how much it would actually cost.  \n\nBut the general gist is that the cakes are overpriced and about 40% more than local bakeries.   \n\nThe sad thing is that we really liked the cake there, and we would have liked to buy it from Giant Eagle.  But considering the ordering drama, we couldn't trust them to deliver a good wedding cake, so we ordered somewhere else."
"1","The parking lot is a clusterfuck.\n\nThe entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk. \n\nThey usually have everything except what I am looking for and/or I just can't find it because it is not placed with similar things. Like when I went looking for organic hot cocoa mix...a week later I found it, not with the other hot cocoa mixes, but very randomly on it's own display at the end of the Asian foods isle. Gnocci? Not with the frozen Italian things, but with the other frozen Italian things...\n\nAnd then when I finally find that one item that I desperately wanted enough to look for it here, I face the crazy check out lines where one has plenty of time to analyze a disturbing cross-section of consumer society, at which point I often re-think my desire for the superfluous item in hand, set it down and swear to never return to this store again."
"1","If they actually actually kept the store stocked, this would be a 4 star review.  However, I fight the traffic, parking lot, people with baskets, elevator, and rest of the customers to get to the bulk spices, Mexican section & produce only to find 100% of the things I need not stocked. So incredibly frustrating!\n  They do have a nice cheese section, bakery, prepared food section & juice bar."
"2","Gotta say, this particular location of Giant Eagle (Market District) was the best Giant Eagle I've been to. Impressive selection of cheeses. Decent international section (although, Wegmans always surprises me! I'm talking mainly Asian stuff.)  Also was the place I became addicted to redbox DVDs.\n\nI always enjoyed the festive events they have going on once in a while. The one that I went to was in celebration of fall - they would decorate the store, even had some live musician near the doorway, give away samples of pie and cookies. Felt really nice to be welcomed into the store that way. \n\nThe only bad thing I'd say about this Giant Eagle is the clusterfuck of a parking lot they have. It's right off of a fairly busy street right by an intersection. They do have a parking garage, but you still have to wait in a line to get there because you're waiting for other people to park/reverse out of their space in front of you."
"1","Selection of specialty and regular items is quite good. BUT, the layout, checkout and parking lots are literally the worst clusterfuck I've seen outside of New Delhi. Not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow."
"1","Ugh! Today is dark, dank, and dreary! I woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup. So out into the gloom I go! I shop here often so this review will probably be modified the next time I visit because I usually really like it here. \n\nEarlier in the week I stopped to pick up a salad and two vegetable panang curries. I like them for lunch when I work at the office. They are not the best ever but I like them because they are pretty spicy and fill me up. This time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies. I pretty much gagged when I attempted to lunch. \n\nSince today I was in need of hot foods I decided to take back these lunches. I don't know if anyone else returns things to grocery stores but $10 bucks is $10 bucks that would go towards my lunch today. Better they pay for the crappy food instead of letting it sit in my fridge while I watch it go bad with a grump face. I had my receipt and took it to customer service. \n\nThe lady was not very nice about it and questioned \"" is that normally packaged like that?\"" to two other employees. The one guy said \"" looks like she ate it and spit back out\"" Seriously?! GROSS! Then she wanted me to go with her and talk to the hot foods department. I declined because I didn't want it!!  Plus I didn't feel great! What more to the story is there?  I won't ever get it again and the attitude towards me because I dared to return poor quality food was not needed."
"1","ETA 2/23/12: Rather than shop here once a week for $25 (down from my 100-200 bill 5 years ago) I now shop exclusively Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and the new Target. There is never any reason to set foot in this Giant Eagle ever again.\n\nI've been a resident of Pittsburgh since 2006 and been shopping at Market District since it opened. Steadily over the past 5 years it has declined in quality. Here are some reasons why:\n\n-The staff and workers surly, unhelpful and downright arrogant. If I have trouble scanning a coupon in self-checkout (which they always manually input and is *always* the machine's fault) it takes me 5 minutes to fla a person down. They're chatting or BS'ing with each other and ignore me. Although there are 20 some checkout lanes, there are never more than a dozen checkout people. This is nonsense. I've shopped early in the morning, lunchtime, 3pm, 7pm and late at night and there is ALWAYS a line for checking out. The lone good employee is Jay, a kindly older man with white hair. Jay is competent and runs circles around others. Jay once loaned me his cell phone to call someone when my wallet and phone were stolen in the parking lot years ago.\n\n-The food is constantly, insanely rearranged. Why do stores rearrange food? So you get distracted and buy more stuff. This is a proven marketing strategy. However, it has gotten to the point in the last 6 months where they move things around SO often and at random that the employees can't keep up. I have to ask for help to find basic vegetables I buy every week (broccoli & cucumbers, for example). In the past 6 months half of the time the poor staffers themselves don't know. I blame Giant Eagle's moronic \""middle management\"" types for abusing market research. \n\n-The food is rarely replenished. For awhile I would have to ask a stockperson to get whole wheat tortillas from the back EVERY WEEK and I don't shop on weekends when it's super busy. This went on for 3 weeks until I finally started buying Trader Joe's whole wheat tortillas - which are always in stock. This has happened for the milk I buy, the shredded cheese, cereals, canned goods, etc. \n\n-The selection is getting crappier while prices rise. More and more products are stocked that are low-brow and fewer new products are stocked (or current products kept in stock) that are more expensive. For example, the rows of Kraft mac n' cheese expand while organic Annie's mac 'n cheese decline. Giant Eagle Market District is serving a well off population. If people from Oakland and the Hill are coming in, build another store for them. I don't wish to shop at a store with more Shurfine products. I understand that food prices have gone up 10% this year HOWEVER I don't see prices increasing at other grocery stores.\n\n-The prices on frozen vegetables is insane. Whole Foods has their house brand of vegetables for $1.25-$1.50 whereas retail Birdseye at GE are $2-2.50. Prices on Hagen Dazs and other high end frozen goods are slightly cheaper or the same price at Whole Foods.\n\n-Overall I find the prices on fruits and fresh vegetables as well as frozen vegetables to be lower and more stable at Whole Foods. When canned goods like whole canned tomatoes or organic beans are on sale at Whole Foods, the deals are better than at GE. This was a place that in 2006 was known as \""Whole Paycheck\"". I spend more and more at Whole Foods these days. Those mini babybel cheese rounds? $1 cheaper at Whole Foods. \n\nIn short, instead of spending $100/week at Giant Eagle, I am minimizing my budget there as much as possible to $25/week. I shop mostly at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's now and even a bit at Target, which had 1.5 pounds of Wild Alaskan Salmon for $9 the other week. The farmer's market serves my need of fresh vegetables in the summer. \n\nGiant Eagle has really screwed itself lately. Their employees are surly and useless. I find the most helpful employees and clean, well stocked stores to be Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. As it is we spend nearly as much on food as we do on rent. We are a target demographic that is disgusted with Giant Eagle.\n\nAs for the girl who says she has a \""foodie boyfriend\""? Please. If they required specialty ingredients they would be going to Whole Foods and the Strip District.\n\nBad move, Giant Eagle. Bad move."
"2","So I decided to go on a cooking and baking frenzy and this place had everything I needed in the recipes I had. I had to find these three different types of cheese to make my lasagna from scratch and the guy working at the cheese area was very helpful. He even helped me get a grated version of one of the cheeses since I didn't want to go through the hassle of grating the block of cheese. The worker at the seafood counter was also nice and friendly. I could literally spend hours here if I could due to all the variety of food selection they have here. I definitely will be back for the huge variety of pickles they sell in their barrels! This place reminds me of a Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and your typical grocery market all combined in one. I even love how they have a wine vending machine in the front!"
"1","Store has a lot to choose from, but we have had HORRIBLE service from the bakery.  Went into the store three times to order our wedding cake, left my contact info only to have no one call back - I finally get someone who can talk with me about a cake at 9am on a Sunday morning, and now they can't do it on a week's notice.  I called the Giant Eagle Marketplace in Robinson, they said no problem, come into the store, we'll have someone to meet you, we'll figure something out.\n\nI guess the snotty people in the Shadyside store just don't need my business."
"1","I guess you pay for what you get...and in this case you get \""The Market District\"" marque.  I don't have much time to write a full review so I'll just post one experience:  I went to this store to purchased smoked turkey necks and/or wings to make soup.  the small package was 11.00 dollars.  I don't remember the poundage, but I remember it was enough meat to make a pot of soup.\n\nI went to the Giant Eagle that was RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, and a similar package of smoked turkey was 3 bux.\n\n:-/"
"2","I'm completely bewildered by the bad reviews I've read.  I am new to Pittsburgh and until recently I always shopped at Dorothy Lane Market, rated the best gourmet grocery store in the country last year. I am impressed with Giant Eagle and some of the items they carry--Jeni's Ice Cream, Talenti Gelato, Montgomery Inn barbecue sauce and great fresh fried chicken.  There are strange items missing though...white corn, brining kits, chicken cloth, thick cut peppered bacon, fresh calves liver, tulips, anchovy stuffed peppers at the antipasto bar, store made salad dressings, pico de gallo for instance.  And in spite of having a HUGE kosher section they do not carry Empire brand frozen chicken fat (schmaltz). Back home if you asked for something they would order it for you.  My only negative experience at Giant Eagle  was with the Kosher deli associate who wasn't at all helpful along these lines. Everyone else has been great! Including the store security guard who helped me find things my first time in the store."
"1","Always busy!  Selection of veggies are ok.  Selection of fruit is a little below average.  Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store.\n\nMain complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical.  You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out."
"1","This used to be my \""go to\"" place for groceries.  However, lately I'm becoming more and more frustrated by the store.  If you go between 4pm and 6pm on a weekday or at any time on Saturday or Sunday, be prepared to navigate a mess of a parking lot, an over crowded store, and a 20 minute wait in a checkout lane. \n\nOn a Sunday, it's impossible to find parking even though there is outdoor parking as well as a 2 story garage.  Once you get in the store, you have to navigate through an obstacle course of a produce section and around overwhelmed first-timers who are trying to figure out where everything is.  It's entirely too small for a place that markets itself towards the \""fresh foods\"" end of things (as opposed to a regular Giant Eagle).  Then you have to figure out where everything is in the aisles.  I get the impression that things were just randomly arranged around the store.  Once you actually have your groceries, the waiting begins.  And waiting....and waiting...and more waiting.  I don't know what the deal is and why the cashiers are so ridiculously slooooooow.\n\nOf course, I'll go back because I like me some fuel perks and it's just convenient, but from now on, I'm going to try to go only on weeknights and do the self-checkout!"
"1","Some people go crazy over this location, me, I just go crazy because of this location.\n\nI hate it, from the congestion in the parking lot to the congestion in every single aisle inside the store.  People are correct that this place has a larger selection of products, but forget your conventional set up for a grocery store.  You would think with this being a Market District.  It would be an easy endeavor.\n\nThis location is a place that I would visit for only one thing, definitely not a place I would regularly stop at, unless I lived within walking distance."
"1","If you live in the city of Pittsburgh and don't want to drive to Wal-Mart, Giant Eagle - otherwise known as \""the Dirty Bird\"" or \""Gian' Iggle\"" if your accent's just right, is where you will shop. Period, end of discussion. Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they'd like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh's East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \n\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \""Market District\"" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I've shopped in - and that's WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \""discount\"" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \""We stock all the same crap you'd find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it's premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\"" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it's helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Manhattan at rush hour. \n\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \""Market District\"" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don't expect it to be near the other juices...you'll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \""excitement\"" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke's face after his plastic surgery disasters.\n\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband's script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that's an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \""Dude, what the fuck,\"" and the response we got was, \""We didn't do nuthin'!\"" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \""valuable grocery coupons.\"" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don't snatch our money and we won't need those \""valuable\"" coupons after all. (Isn't it also fascinating that we've been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can't sell to teenagers in an alley?)\n\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock. Otherwise, it's a grocery store, and a below-average one at that."
"1","This is a customer service based review, The one star is for selections because this store has items other locations often do not. \n\nDisclaimor / Accountability check todays incident which I am writing this review on is partly my fault... the part where I got zero assistance from customer service is their fault. \n\nSo I stopped here for ground lamb for an awesome stuffed mushroom recipe... I like to think I am speedy and smart when I need to be so I run through self-serve checkout. This is my third grocery store stop of the day. Warning!! for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags!!\n\nI accidently leave a bag in the self serve area but do not notice until I return home..... eek. It's ok though because I have my receipt, upon returning home in about 20 minutes I phone customer support. \n\n\""Hello I left a bag in your self serve area I still have the receipt is there anything you can do?\""\n\n\""Let me see if it was reported by our staff.\""\n\n\""Ok it was ground lamb...\"" \n\n\""Nothing was reported yet so there is nothing I can do unless its reported.\""\n\nI pause and think to myself.. really nothing.... even go check the area yourself to see if its still there?\n\n\""Again I ask oh really is there nothing you can do?\"" While thinking to myself basic problem solving skills nothing fancy....\n\n\""No I am sorry nothing we can do.\""\n\nHmm well if that's it then I guess I will go to Whole Foods the next time I need something fancy and overpriced for a recipe. Who ever got my ground lamb or didn't enjoy it on me... \n\nI heard Whole CEO treats employees badly this is an ethical issue for me but sometimes you have to make a personal choice based on your experiences."
"1","I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip."
"1","The GE is overly-large and over-priced. Yes, I have seen the food same item at other neighborhood GE's for less. For those of us who like to \""shop the perimeter\"" of the grocery store (meaning where the real food lives), and for those of us who do not like their grocery store to feel like an airport, this store is not good. I realize I am in the minority, however. Most people want bigger, more, more expensive (if they notice). And they put up with a bad parking lot and long check out lines, too. \n\nHonestly, I prefer the (gasp) East Lib/ Shakespeare St. GE. I can always park right outside the door and have had no problems with the produce, the dairy items or the service."
"1","The produce here is always beaten to a pulp and expensive. We only get it here for convenience. The romaine is especially pitiful. We complained (finally) and received an apology and an offer for free cotton candy flavored grapes. We never did redeem our grape offer (as Snape would say, 'Pity',) and we haven't bought romaine here since we started getting the bulk of our groceries from Aldi for less. They have a large selection here and the generic brand goods are, well, good, but it's still pretty pricey. We head to Aldi first and get whatever's still on the list at GE, but we're getting less and less here. Overall thought on Giant Eagle: MEH."
"1","The good: large selection. \nThe bad: the crazy high prices, missing price labels, inconvenient location. \nIt's come to the point that I avoid this place if I can. Aldi's is better for the basics and Pearl Market in the Strip district has better produce for 4x cheaper than this place."
"1","I don't care for this Giant Eagle, and that is being kind. The only reason I ever go here is for a quick item or two. My ideas for grabbing something in a \""quick\"" manner always end up being terrible because there is nothing quick about this place. The staff is generally unfriendly except for a few employees (2 or 3) who are always wonderful and helpful.\n\nNo one seems to enjoy working here at all, and there are always soooo many lines because there are never more than three to four aisles open at any given time, even on weekends.\n\nEverything is overpriced, except they will occasionally have deals on soda and greek yogurt."
"1","Another bad experience.  The staff is sloppy.  The deli doesn't mark the product and passes off whatever slimey old crap they're trying to get rid of as what you ordered.  And good luck parking."
"1","I got tired of waiting in line with one register open and 10 people in front of me. Won't be back."
"1","Shopping at this place is so frustrating you will want to throw knives when you leave.\n\nIt's always packed, ALWAYS.  And forget about the self check out lines, which attract people who have never seen technology, cash registers, touch screens, money, conveyor belts, groceries bags, or food--like flies.  Seriously, people get up to them, and then just stand there, like the self check out is some great mystery.  \n\nThe machine is all, \""PLease move item to bagging area?\""  and they're all, \""What?  What do I do?  I don't know, so I'll stand here and stare for 20 minutes!\""\n\nThey have a wide selection of foods that you won't be able to get to bc I promise a fellow shopper will have their cart right in front of every single item you want.\n\nIf you enjoy paying $10 for salad, I recommend the salad bar.  I've never passed on grape tomatoes bc they were 'too heavy\"" before, but that's my fault.  I once made an overly enthusiastic salad up and then it was $$$ and I was feeling $ that day.\n\nOkay, the guy at the cheese counter is awesome.  I once told him I needed to bring a cheese plate to a party and asked him to pick out the cheese for me, and it was like he had been waiting all his life for someone to ask him for help.  He did put together the most awesome cheese tray ever, and I learned all sorts of facts about Humboldt Fog.  Now every time I  walk past he comes out behind the counter and gives me a hug, and at Christmas he gave me a little tiny cheese cutter and then everyone aroudn me was like, \""Wow, how much cheese does that woman buy?\""  But seriously, talk to the cheese guy, he is awesome!\n\nTip:  bring the veggie tray.  Dont bring the cheese  tray.  The cheese tray is $$$ and people only eat the gouda and the cheddar.\n\nThey sell beer there now, which is good.  You'll need some after shopping.  The flower selection is also pretty good.\n\nThere's an Aldi up the street and a Trader Joe's nearby.  Both are far less infuriating to shop at."
"1","Items don't have price tags. That's the only reason why I gave them such a poor mark. I hope that caught their attention. \n\nI try to buy produce and a lot of times many of the items I seem to select have no price tags, price stickers, barcode, name of produce and per/lb info. none of that. It's not listed anywhere and when I ask an associate they themselves don't know. Now please don't try retraining them because your associates are very kind and generous this is a corporate issue. \n\nSame goes for milk, cold cuts and breakfast meat products. \n\nEggs sometimes have poor labels placed in odd locations confusing the customer and forcing them to go on an Easter Egg hunt for the right price. \n\n\nThey also have fake sales. Placing price tags that are actually higher then the week before and claiming 'you are saving'.\n\nIt's close and convenient. \n\nPrices are a bit high. \n\nAssociates are so kind. They are generous, considerate and very polite. \n\nI still like them. I'm there every week."
"1","I needed Italian bread for an event so there was no choice except to buy the bread that was available. The bakery had plenty of Italian bread but therein lies the problem- I buy Italian bread on an almost weekly basis so I know the way it's supposed to look as well as cost. For about the third maybe fourth time now the bread yeast hasn't risen all the way. It looks like squashed sourdough bread instead of Italian bread. Instead of about 4\""-5\"" it's about 2\"" thick. To add insult to injury the bread even costs more during the times it was thinner. Instead of the bread costing $2.49 just like any other day it cost $2.69 when it's thinner. Does that make any sort of logical sense? I am disappointed and this review is emotional in nature but there are actual facts here as well."
"1","Everyone complains about how expensive Whole Foods is in this area, but I find the Market District to be even more expensive for lesser quality. I despise going to this location, it is always packed with the rudest people imaginable and the employees act like they have anywhere better to be than at work. I have worked in a grocery store before and it is not always the most pleasant, but the way I have been treated there everytime I go is beyond imagining. Giant Eagle has managed to monopolize grocery stores in this area and kept out other chains I would prefer such as Wegman's. The produce here is subpar and anytime I do buy it I end up with a swarm of fruit flies at my house. I once saw a tomato display crawling with hundreds of them and the employees did nothing. Go to Whole Foods and buy their store brand, you'll save yourself money and be around employees who are enthusiastic to help."
"1","I mean, how many stars can you really give a laundromat? This place smells like mildew constantly.. Like, since I've been going, it's never NOT smelled like mildew. I'd like to think that a place you go to clean things..should be clean? Guess not. Anyway, the people who work here are courteous and nice, if that matters."
"2","Best place in the city for drop off laundry I've found so far. Period."
"2","Fun store! Though I just spent a couple minutes here while my husband was browsing, I loved the old fashioned vibe. Plus, the owner seemed to be very hands-on. Not only was she helping a lot of customers find particular items, but I heard a couple customers even address her by name as they entered."
"2","I was able to come in, pick out 3 tops that were really nice when they were clearly really busy and they got me a dressing room within seconds upstairs in the mens department. The staff was really helpful and accommodating when I asked if they had a different size. I will certainly be back for some more clothes."
"1","Decent price on domestic pitchers. Entrees were half off but all looked mediocre. Tried the jambalaya and it was so so. Big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service."
"2","Hey Doc!\n\nI dig your deck.  And I also like specials that involve a $7 pitcher of good beer!\n\nOh, and great service!\n\nThanks for all that!\nMichael E"
"1","Doc's is a decent place in the Spring and Summer, when their 2nd floor upstairs patio is open. They have reasonably priced pitchers of beer and well drinks. It's nice to sit outside and relax after a long day of school or work.\n\nThe beer selection isn't that great and the upstairs bar is not full. Sometimes their drink \""specials\"" are served in tiny plastic cups. The service can also be rather slow.\n\nI am not a big fan of their food (pizzas are bland and the burgers overcooked), although it is nice to split an appetizer with a group of people."
"2","Nice place. I like it."
"1","Doc's is a good bar to go to when you are with friends and don't have any set plans for the evening.  However, if you need to be somewhere fast I wouldn't advise going here.  The past times I've eaten at Doc's it's been on the large outdoor patio upstairs.  The patio is nice and provides for a lot of seating, however it hasn't been updated in several years.  I recently made a trip to BRGR the new gourmet burger joint several blocks away and their outdoor seating is quite hard to beat.  \n\nThe food at Doc's is what you would expect to find at a greasy/beer/bar.  Cheese fries, burgers, some salads, mediocre pasta, etc.  Although some of their dishes in the past have been much better than I anticipated, the food isn't something I leave the place remembering.  \n\nThere is smoking allowed on the patio upstairs so if you don't mind smoke then no worries.  However, if you don't like to breathe in smoke while you're eating, pray that there is no one smoking in your section when you go.  There are space heaters upstairs in the winter for when it starts to get cold before the snow comes.  It is nice to be outside and still be warm but the food and beer pretty much stay the same year round.\n\nI wouldn't say no if someone asked me to join them for a drink at Doc's but I would probably suggest eating somewhere else first.  You'll get your food faster and be able to breathe a bit better in a different restaurant."
"1","I've only come here for threading, and the woman who threads only comes in a few times a month. I can't say she's best, but she gets the job done. I am generally willing to spend dough on beauty services, but for what you get here, the price is kind of a rip ($16 for eyebrows) - especially since it's usually under $10 at most threading salons around the country. Anyways, it's a decent option, considering there are no other alternatives in the city.\n\nThey also have a large nail salon, but $50+++ for a basic pedicure is practically a sin. There isn't even any kind of use of specialized products or posh ambiance that might justify the price.... just chairs by the large windows with aging tint. In almost any other major city, I can sit in a spa chair and get a french pedicure, and still walk out paying less. \n\nAs for the salon, I think the alleged \""snob vibe\"" is confused with its effort to rise about the early 1990's image it presents. Seriously, we're almost at 2010 - the place (and the website) really could use an upgrade. From what I've generally seen, you'll probably get a \""safe\"" haircut here... meaning a clean 'do, but nothing that's going to make you bring sexy back. The front desk folks didn't really cause me much concern, but I agree that they could work on being (or at least pretending to be) more friendly."
"2","Platinum Blonde Perfection.  Jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde 'do ever.  It was gorgeous.  My hair looked like corn silk.  If I had boat-loads of money, I'd fly him out to LA every 6 weeks for a touch up.   Go to see Jay...tell him Laura from LA sent you."
"1","The pedicures at DeStefinos  are a complete rip-off. IMO\n\nWhen I booked the $53 pedicure, I was told\n(1) it would last an hour ,  and would\n(2) include  a foot massage   \n\nNot true:  the manicurist was done in 45 minutes.  and \nThe advertised  foot massage consisted of a quick rub of my feet and lower leg, finished in two minutes or less.  \n\nWhen the manicurist was done, I complained that\nmy feet were still rough.  \""You can't possibly expect your feet\nto be smooth after only one pedicure.\""\n\nExcuse me?  and why not?  Every other pedicure I've had\n(for much less money) got my feet smooth,"
"2","Great salon for hair...not so much nails. My hair stylist Vanessa is great. I can go in without a clear picture of what I want and she gives me exactly what I wanted. I get so many compliments on my hair."
"1","I'm changing my review after a bad hair cut that was not handled correctly. I went in told her what I wanted, showed a picture and she decided to barely look at it and totally ignore everything I said. I said I wanted some short layers in the front and long layers in the back and I wanted victoria secret model hair. Instead she took the opportunity to do whatever she wanted and I ended up with chopped off layers of one length on the sides and no long layers in the back. It looked like I had 2 haircuts one that was shoulder length and the rest long. Nothing was blended, it just did not make any sense nothing about it was good. It was horrible.\n\nWhen I went back to get it fixed by her she just kept trying to defend why she did the hair cut and why it looked good. Ignoring the fact that I was unhappy and I didn't like it. She just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns. The fix turned out ok but still not what I wanted in the first place.\n\nI just wanted her to listen to me and stop making excuses. And I thought the manager or head stylist should have come over to talk with me but that never happened. The front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well.\n\nSo I will never go back and I'm sorry for suggesting this place since I only got a trim the first time I went here and could have had the same cut from anywhere."
"1","Although this store has great employees, it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It is absolutely ghetto inside.  I don't think they've redone the store since the early 90s.  It's an embarrassment on Walnut."
"1","I ordered pictures through the online photo center and requested them to be printed and picked up from this location. I selected and paid extra for same day prints and were told online that they'd be ready in 1-3 hours. I went to pick them up several hours later and the guy behind the counter couldn't find my photos. He said, \""Oh, it must be because our printer is out of ink, we should have your prints on Friday or Saturday\"" This is Wednesday, I need them today! If I wanted them in 4 days I would have paid $10 less! I asked for them to send my file to another location so that they could be printed there. No such luck, they said they were not able to do that. Now I have to upload, size and crop all of my photos again and reorder them to be picked up from another store. If they would have just called me this morning and told me the problem, I would have my pictures in time. Now, it's far too late for any Rite Aid to print my photos tonight. Come on people, communicate with your customers! Thanks for nothing!\n\nGo to the Baum location. It's just around the corner and far nicer inside."
"2","I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot."
"2","This is a great shop in Shadyside with a little something for everyone.  It has lots of statuary, candles, and free trade items.  The second floor is simply filled with books on all sorts of subjects.  They seem to specialize in recovery - from addiction, abuse, etc., but they also have an even larger collection of self help and metaphysical subjects.  It's a nice local store to support when you're in the area."
"2","This feels like one of those places that are tucked away and is somewhat of an adventure for you to find. Walking Walnut in Shadyside you usually don't think to walk down the side streets unless you have a purpose for doing so.\n\nJourneys, not to be confused with the chain shoe store, has a nice mix of items. From gems and incense, to books and art. It took us a while to browse the shelves as there was so much to look over. Walking through here as well makes you think that you are walking through someones personal pintrest page in real life.\n\nThe book selection upstairs is a lot of self help, guidance type of reads. Good if you have a job where you are there to help people. They also have educational board games that would be good for children (don't read that as boring either).\n\nWhy not five stars?  I'm a bit skeptical of a place that sells items that are to help you cure yourself when it's not medication.  But that shouldn't deter people from coming here."
"2","I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.\n\nFirst...I'm a fan of new agey type places and the people that inhabit them. \n\nSecond...the merchandise in here is pretty awesome. Candles, cards, medals, statues, love spells, books, signs, jewelry....I could go on and on. The gemstones are very reasonable and handpicked at different shows. Some of the items I think are REALLY inexpensive as compared to what I've seen in similar stores around the country and really beautiful.\n\nThird...I love the ladies that own/run Journeys. They're always eager to help find the perfect gift for someone (or myself usually) and direct me to the right item. I never feel like the are \""selling\"" but are happy for people to look and let the items find them.\n\nFourth...how I got here. My friends and I were discussing card/spiritual readers that we had been to in the past and this place came up. I was happy to try someone and something new and different for a reading. Love, love, love Stephanie for Akashic records. Rebecca (my usual reader from another place) for Tarot was great, too, but I don't believe she reads here anymore. \n\nIn any sense, if you just want to peruse, look for a great gift for yourself or someone else or find an interesting read or HAVE an Interesting read you, stop in here. You will not be disappointed."
"1","Tiffany prices with Kay Jewelers selection.\n\nI've gone to this place a couple of times to look for various items over the past few years.  Every time I leave the store I always try to remind myself never to come back.\n\nThe prices are way more than what they should be.  Tacori rings and other merchandise is marked up about 30-40% more than other jewelry stores in Pittsburgh.\n\nI've had a couple of nice salespeople work with me, but some of the others were just plain rude.  They try to do a great job preying on Love by upselling items or addons that aren't even necessary.\n\nThere are many other great jewelry stores in Pittsburgh that you can look at other than here."
"1","I just accepted a beautiful ring from Hennes. I have had nothing but compliments and I must say that the ring was beautiful. Unfortunately within 4 days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing. I'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of. But my new fianc\u00e9 is very upset by this."
"2","Cozy and comfortable, our food was really good, and the waitstaff friendly and efficient!\n\nThe mussels were great (garlic madness) and they split some entrees for us in the kitchen. wowowow.\n\nWill definitely try and revisit next time I'm in Pittsburgh."
"2","Girasole is probably my favorite restaurant in the Walnut St. corridor.  I specifically want to talk about their salad.  I know this charming and cozy Italian restuarnt is not a one trick pony (their various Raviolis being especially exceptional) but their signature Girasole Salad is really something special.  In Italian the word \""Girsole\"" means \""Sunflower,\"" a flavor that really comes through in this salad.  Not only is the salad sprinkled in sunflowers, the dressing is made of some blend of sunflower oil and vinegar and really makes the salad stand out from its peers.  I have thought this dressing so deliciously tangy and unique, I've bought it from the restaurant in a bottle on more than one occasion.  Served in a generous helping, you can order the salad with chicken or shrimp, which are always tender and succulent.  Red onions and gorgonzola really complete the flavor experience.  Really, it's the number one salad in town."
"1","I recently had a horrible experience at Girasole. I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant due to its cozy atmosphere and decent Italian food. However, this past visit was unfortunate. The host was horrendous and extremely rude. I had brought my parents, who were visiting from out of town, and they were appalled at how rude the host was. Girasole is usually quite busy but it was also disorganized. I had made a reservation and arrived early knowing that there would be a wait. However, we saw three tables be seated prior to us, all of which had arrived much after us. When we tried to tell the hostess, he was even more rude than when we had arrived. To be honest, I could have overlooked the seating other parties prior to us if we had at least been given a friendly smile or a warm welcome. \n\nRegarding the food, it is adequate, nothing in comparison to other much more exciting and fulfilling Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh."
"2","I don't know if coming early would help any... but when we got there at 8pm, the place was hoppin'. There were people seated from as close to the kitchen and all the way up the stairs by the sidewalk. There were hopefuls milling about a bit to get down and place their name for a seating. When we were able to reach the desk, the wait time was 50 minutes.\n\nWe went to Mercurio's for a while, took a stroll around Walnut, and eventually sat down by some very convenient benches nearby. After what we thought was 'adequate' wait time, we peered a bit over the fence and down towards the man (who we think may have been the owner). After a bit, he nodded at us, and started moving a couple of tables around inside. We took that as a signal, meaning, \""Come on down. I'm wrestling these tables apart for you.\""\n\nWe ordered the carne special (steak with alfredo for $30) and the torcia ($15). I wouldn't say that they were the best that i'd ever had, but they were pretty good. The vegetables are fresh; the pasta was just right and sauced/souped enough to my liking. The service, provided mostly by Diane, was excellent. She was friendly and attentive, despite the throngs of customers. The crowds are loud, the atmosphere very.. cozy.. and the walkways very narrow, and, yet, the food and drinks keep coming, accident-free. It seems like it could be highly stressful for the servers, but Diane was smiling every time she came back. Awesome."
"1","We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason, on the warmest day of summer, the a/c was not on. Everyone in our party was schvitzing and trying hard not to ask our waitress to drop the attitude.\n  \nThe food was fine, but again, when the rest of the experience is poor it really doesn't matter how good the food is. We won't be back."
"1","After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\""Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\""...\""Sure, what is it?\"".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole."
"1","They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded.    Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner.  Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table.  Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate!\n\nPasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great.  $20 for noodles and meat sauce... \n\nDinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices.    Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had.  \n\n Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent.  I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!\n\nOverall a very disapointing night out."
"2","For my 100th review...I'm taking it back home. \n\nGirasole is a lovely little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street. They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it's definitely ideal for a date in the summer. Our service was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive. \n\nMy friend and I split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans. The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy, plump fresh tomatoes . We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness. \n\nWe also split the bruschetta, which came styled with ricotta cheese. It was also delicious. \n\nI picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which were large little pillows of warm goodness. I think there were only 4, but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce. The herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish. \n\nEverything at Girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor. Anytime I'm home I come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun. Classic Italian food."
"2","What is there to say about Girasole? An Italian owner who wanders around the restaurant (often with a glass of wine) greeting friends and customers and kibitzing with staff; a friendly staff; and fantastic food. Seriously, the food is great. Order anything on the menu & you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe best part about Girasole, though, is the intimate indoor & outdoor atmosphere & the wine. Pours are generous, and there's a fantastic selection to choose from. If you're having difficulty, your server will be happy to help you, too (ask for Ryan). Did I mention the wine? Seriously, the pours are generous, and if you MUST bring your own, bring a lot, because the corking fee is very reasonable."
"2","I am from Pittsburgh, but now live in Detroit and I think about Girasole often as a special place to go when you want some great Italian comfort food, and a loud, bustling atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and you'll often see Mr. Girasole walking back and forth, checking how you like your meal and pouring more wine.  This small and very quaint Italian restaurant is located in the heart of Shadyside.  You have to walk down about 6 or 7 steps to get to the door, so if you are handicapped or elderly, it may be a tad tough.  It is a little pricey, but for good, Italian like your Mamma makes, it's worth it.  I had the pumpkin ravioli and the house salad.  I loved the salad dressing--it's light and delicious and the pumpkin ravioli was excellent as well.  I really chowed on the thick slices of Italian bread and they willingly brought lots more upon request.  We had a party of 9 and were happy to have made a reservation in advance.  Go early on a weekend evening as the wait looked treacherous by the time we left the restaurant at 7:00PM.  Girasole reminds me of eating in my Italian Grandma's basement kitchen!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the servers were a bit slow in providing basics like water and silverware in the beginning of the meal.  Otherwise, Manga! Manga!"
"2","We just ate our way through 12,000 miles of road trip across the US and back. This was, hands down, the best restaurant we tried. Service was exceptional. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting. And the food was out of this world fresh and good.\n\nI had a spinach pasta with sweet corn, baby tomatoes, and fresh basil. It's my new favorite pasta in the world, so fresh and savory, with just the right combo of tangy and sweet. \n\nThe house salads were exceptionally fresh and full of good veggies and cheese. My son said his pasta, penne with sausage, was terrific. The bread was great.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing to complain about in this dining experience. Even better, it was the kind of meal that made us want to go back to Pittsburgh, just to eat here again.\n\nAnd it was a great deal -- $44 including tax, tip, and drinks for two people -- for a whole lot of fantastic food."
"1","Really disappointing. Service is bad when you enter. If it is busy expect to be treated poorly. Have a reservation? That will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else. Once seated servers are pleasant and nice,\n\nThe food is poor. Verges on disgusting. I had their much-beloved squid ink linguine with lobster. The pasta was mushy--way overcooked. Far too much cream and cheese. Lobster meat suspiciously tasted like it was recently thawed out from a frozen state. Didn't finish this dish.\n\nMy wife had a chicken special. Dry. Boring. Bland.\n\nMaybe we just had a bad experience (it was a busy Friday night 8pm). The popularity of the place and the plethora of positive reviews and high ratings indicates that this might have some great moments, but unfortunately not this time."
"1","OVERALL:\nGiven the popularity of Girasole, I was disappointed that this place didn't even come close to living up to the hype. Although there were some highlights, there were plenty of negatives to counter them.\n\nSERVICE:\nDespite having a reservation, we were made to wait for over 45 minutes for a table, standing outside in the cold. Also, we were only given cutlery for two of the three people in our party. Not a good start. Once seated, though, the service was good. Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive.\n\nFOOD:\nDisappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. \n\nFortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal.\n\nMy steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. \n\nDesserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting.\n\nAMBIANCE: \nProbably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nProbably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss."
"2","I ate here last night with a dining partner.   Having read many of the reviews on this site we went early on a Tuesday evening and were seated in one of only two empty tables.  We had thought about getting reservations but the hours that came with my gift card said No Reservations.  The decor of the restaurant was very nice. They had copper tables in a cramped type of environment that is very European.\n\nWe decided to forgo appetizers this day and instead got drinks.  I had something that resembled a manhattan while my dining partner had the Bellini and both were good.  Since my dining partner and I both ordered entrees we were served with a dinner salad.  It was one of the nicer salads that I have had with Gorgonzola, sunflower seeds and chick peas amongst the greens and a nice vinaigrette paired with it.  For dinner I had the pumpkin ravioli while my dining partner had the porcini gnocchi.  The pumpkin ravioli was absolutely delicious although only receiving 5 for the price that was paid was a bit disappointing.  The gnocchi was much more substantial though and just as tasty.  For dessert we had the lemon cake which was fantastic and came with fresh raspberries and blackberries as a garnish.  When all was said and done it was by far some of the best food that I have tasted recently and all of my concerns from previous posts were undone with the service being great and having no wait for our table.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that this restaurant had wonderful food and not too high of a price point and I will definitely be back.  I would recommend that you go early on a weekday though as the seating is very limited."
"1","I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.\n\nIt was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting.\nThe owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar.\nFinally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations, walked in after us, but knew the owner. Very poor form on the owners part. 2. He said we would \""be taken care of\"". I was thinking maybe an appetizer or wine, something for promising us a table with reservations and then having us wait for over an hour. But when the bill came there was none of that.\nWe still had a good time since the company was good but it will be a long time before I go back to this restaurant."
"2","Love finding these hole in the wall spots in my backyard, I call Pittsburgh. My friend had taken photos for Pittsburgh Magazines Blog, and demanded I go and try it. Let me tell you, Italy has arrived in this place. The owner, was there during our time and they display outside seating, as well as indoors. Their indoor seating is I feel below street level with brick walls, and community art hanging on the wall. Which rumor has it, you can buy. \nAs recommended I made a reservation, and was seated immediately. Big up, right there not including the atmosphere, very rustic, very homey Italian to me. We were greeted by our server, and I ordered a water with one of their \""special, owner loves this drink\"" my friend ordered another specialty drink. I noticed the prices and strayed away from the appetizers, so I could order my entree and dessert. When our bread arrived I noticed this neat little oil holder, it was shaped like a jug, with a grape mold that held the balsamic vinegar. I WANT that thing. I almost walked away with it, pocket pinched it, but here comes running; in my conscious, knowing that my awful deed would have split all over my purse, knowing my luck. Any-hoo, haven't met a place to go wrong with bread. My drink that I ordered wasn't my kind of drink, there were bitters involved, and my taste buds and bitters don't get along. I told the waitress, and she agreed and said not everybody likes the drink, I'll take it off your bill, and I ordered another, which was amazing. \nAs for their menu, they do have specials that coincide with the season. They have to make a bang for their buck, can I please recommend they print that seasonal menu on another kind of paper..other than computer paper?! I was a little bummed out about that. I ordered the cocoa fettuccine, with pistachios, leeks, cauliflower, and Gorgonzola. This is a late post, but I can still taste this pasta. HOUSE MADE pasta, you can't go wrong. This pasta was just amazing. absolutely amazing. My mouth is watering as I type, Now you know this is a good place, if I'm drooling. The love I have for this restaurant is intensified if you have tried their spinach and ricotta ravioli, in this creamy tomato sauce. That you could tell was authentic, or well their own recipe. I seriously can't get enough of this place.\nOn to dessert, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry gelato. Real chunks of raspberry and white chocolate, it was just an awesome ending to a great meal. This hole in the wall is the place to be."
"2","This is the place I imagine sneaking into on an evening spent with that charming someone who captures your heart with the slightest smile. Late spring, strolling along the cobblestone streets window shopping when the sky darkens, and the clouds open up. Huddled under an umbrella, his arm around you to warm you from the sudden chill, you scamper down the few steps and duck into the warmth of Girasole.\n\nYou're immediately greeted like family; with a glow in the background as if a huge fire were burning. The small space is filled with lovely folks laughing, and sharing wine; eyes twinkling as they listen to the live music being played by the gentleman walking around strumming his guitar singing loudly.\n\nThe menu is simply simple Italian. The wine list is the sweet red table wine offered immediately after you sit down. The desserts are so worthy of the extra calories. Home made and delightful. \n\nAlmost as tasty as that good night kiss."
"2","This is one of the, not the best kept secrets, in Shadyside.  Solid Italian food, great atmosphere both inside and out, and family owned and run. Have eaten here dozens of times, and never had a bad meal. If there was only one criticism, it might be the drink selection. By that I mean cocktails.  There's not a dedicated bartender, and the drinks are made by the servers who are already too busy.  The wine selection is small but has something for most budgets and is pretty good."
"1","Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud, we couldn't hear our waitress and thus the specials or the people we were seated with. Everyone is back to back; no place to hang a coat or move between tables to visit the restroom. We won't go back."
"2","Pretty darn tasty. Walked in on a whim after a busy night shopping on Walnut and enjoyed the food immensely. It's a noisy and busy atmosphere but that was fine since it was fun to talk a bit to our neighbors. \n\nJust don't expect a romantic, quiet evening to yourself."
"2","Always a pleasure to eat at this place. I've never had a bad meal.\n\nThanks bob"
"1","From the other reviews I really had high expectations for this Italian restaurant - was hoping for some authentic Italian food. Not the case. Not a lot of pasta options and those that were on the menu weren't homemade. \n\nIt's unlikely I will return because the food was mediocre, the service was very slow and the prices were high."
"1","The receptionist was ver unwelcoming even on the phone. Very rude. This is my first review, I have never been so annoyed . I wanted to ask a few things before I come for dinner, but the guy just hung up on me. Thanks."
"1","My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu, the front of house staff quickly asked us whether or not we wanted to sit outside squished behind a baby's highchair in a corner or inside where it was very crowded. We tried to politely ask the man if we could see a menu first. After looking at the menu we decided we liked what the menu had on it, but it was just really crowded. When we returned the menu to the front of the house staff he snatched the menu away from us and said, \""Yeah I knew you guys weren't going to buy anything anyway\"". What if we were about to order something? That completely turned us away from this restaurant. We could tell we were just another group of people to get in and get out. Very rude and unacceptable. Never going back."
"2","Food here is out of this world good.  The venue is extremely charming too.  Service was a disappointment.  Couldn't help but get the feeling that we were annoying our waitress just by being patrons.  Speed was fine, food was great, but I don't like apologizing just because I chose to eat in your restaurant."
"2","Great food, great location, ok service. Sometimes you have to wait for a table despite your reservation. It has a great Italian atmosphere and everyone is talking loudly which makes it a great place for a date or a dinner with friends."
"2","Girasole is one of the places in Pittsburgh I always go to when I have visitors from out of town. The quaint, semi-hidden spot right off of Walnut Street accompanied by its warm and inviting atmosphere make it an excellent people pleaser. The menu is fairly small and changes seasonally to assure fresh and delicious ingredients. The wine list is extensive and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli is usually featured and always delicious. Another plus is that it's open for lunch as well and offers a slightly cheaper selection. Regardless, though, it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food and experience. The only downside is that the venue itself is tiny and it would definitely be difficult to accommodate a larger party. \n\nOne of my favorite things about Girasole is that the owner is also often the host! He has such a bold personality and really makes the whole atmosphere more homey and authentic feeling. To add to this mood, there is often live music in the restaurant--usually just a single violin or guitar player. My favorite experience at Girasole was one late summer night when it was beginning to cool down and I took some friends of mine from Cleveland to have dinner there. I knew they would enjoy Girasole but the wait was long so we wound up sitting outside on the patio even though it was a little cold. A man with a guitar went around the restaurant singing beautiful songs to each table and eventually made it outside. Since we were the only table outside we took our request and sang the best rendition of Al Green's \""Let's Stay Together\"" I've ever heard! \n\nGirasole is a wonderful treat amongst Pittsburgh's restaurant scene and never fails to deliver a delicious meal and a wonderful dining experience!"
"1","LOUD!\n\nWhen someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place, so everything is pretty cramped together. \n\nService is quick, genuine, and attentive. Food was slightly above average but far from memorable - just not worth putting up with the noise level over. Perhaps for takeout....\n\nHad the greens and beans w/ the Cappa Santa."
"2","www.bigtsreviews.com"
"1","Most times, I absolutely love a little place with a lot of character...  unfortunately Girasole manages to provide both but not in a good way.\n\nWhile the dinning room itself has some great traits (stone walls, coppertop tables, etc.), diners more or less are forced to eat almost on top of one another.  As with most small joints, Girasole has the stereotypical quirky owner that is completely passionate about their business, unfortunately in this case, the owner slugged down 3-4 glasses of wine in what seemed to be an hour...  shouting up the stairs outside at patrons and ushering them around like cattle.\n\nRelative to the food, I was super excited for a seasonal menu.  Going against my biggest desires to get the risotto, I decided on the spring chicken dish (hoping for some lighter fare as well).  Ravioli, chicken breast, sauteed greens and a seasoned broth.  While attractive looking, the ravioli seemed like they came from a frozen bag, the chicken breast was dry and the broth was bland.  While the greens were decent, there were barely enough for a few bites.\n\nMaybe everyone else sees something I don't, because this place seems to be constantly packed."
"1","Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food, but there is only so much indifference one can handle."
"2","Lovely atmosphere, friendly and attentive waitstaff, just a bit crammed--you sit very close to the neighboring tables.  Great meals all around, we will be back!"
"2","After looking for an occasion to go here for a few months, we finally went for my birthday dinner. It was a Sunday evening and the restaurant was quite busy. The area is kind of small and crowded, there was a large party near us which was making a lot of noise.\n\nDespite the crowd, the food was delicious! The starter goat cheese salad was the best salad I have ever had, and may have been better than the pasta..I had the lamb meatballs with cavatelli which was yummy. The lamb was moist and flavorful. I also had a few bites of the penne pasta with marinara sauce and chicken. You could tell the sauce was fresh and made from scratch since it was so sweet. Complimentary bread was good too.\n\nWould definitely go again, maybe on a weekday when it may be less crowded and noisy."
"2","Excellent, We went last night to celebrate my parents 40th Anniversary.  Food was great! Our server Rachael did a awesome job.  The restaurant had neat character,it was a bit loud but it is small, so that's expected.  Wonderful all around."
"2","Beautiful ambiance, fantastic service, delicious food, and a personal toast from the owner was a great touch!"
"1","The owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience.  I arrived with my parents at 6pm, just as it stated to get busy.  We submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins.  As tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations.  It was like we were invisible.  As the wait approached 40 min I went up to him and asked how many reservations there were and if he had any idea how much longer it would be.  He looked at me, mumbled a sentence with the word \""ridiculous\"" and said he didn't know.  I politely told him it wasn't a big deal and said he could remove our name from the list.  As we were leaving he came out the door and said we could sit outside (it was 50 degrees with a chance of rain).\n\nOnly reason I'm leaving this review is because my mom was all worked up and felt disrespected.\n\nI just can't support business owners like this.  Go elsewhere."
"1","It's been a minute since I lived in Pittsburgh, but I frequently return to attend events and visit close friends from school and work. I think Pittsburgh has absolutely wonderful food, and I truly became entranced with the culinary scene while attending Carnegie Mellon and checking out local fare. Luckily for us CMU kids, Shadyside was a hop, skip, and a jump away. Therefore, it was naturally the perfect neighborhood to dine and shop.\n\nI had the opportunity to attend two group birthday dinners at Girasole. Both times the food was authentic. The place itself is very small and intimate, so it has a very nice, cozy, if not bordering on claustrophobic feel. That is not the impetus for my review. Both times I have dined here, the customer service was intolerable. A moment that I will never forget in all my life was at my birthday dinner, when the waitress came to our table as we were about to leave, and said to our group, (my friends who had graciously paid for my dinner) \""why is the tip so low? What was wrong with my service?\"" My friends had left this woman at least a 15% tip. I will never forget this publicly humiliating moment for the rest of my life. This should serve as a reminder and a stark warning for all who work in customer service (as I have myself) that you should never, ever do something as atrocious as what this waitress did. There were so many alternatives to how she or the restaurant itself could have approached this, but I truly believe she acted in the least responsible, most alarming manner I have yet to see from anyone who holds a job. That is the prime reason why I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"1","Come for the food and not the atmosphere or service. I Made reservations for 7 pm on a Friday. When we got there was a line out the door. After pushing our way to the front of the crowded entrance to inform the host we were here, we found a crowd of people standing there complaining that they haven't seen the host in 10 minutes. The host finally came to the front and I said we had reservations. He asked who else had reservations for two, which no one did except for me and my girlfriend. Without asking for my name we were seated right next to the host's podium where he had to pull out the table so we could fit to sit down. We were practically sitting on the laps of the couple next to us. The waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations. Aside from the poor service and chaos, the food was pretty good. I had the risotto which was a little bland but the sausage and mussels made up for it. Also, I was surprised by the limited number of seafood options. I will give girasole another chance at a less busy time but was not impressed."
"2","funky little cafeteria atop a very popular pittsburgh breakfast spot. it's BYOB - always nice - and the food is abundant and tasty. very casual, small menu, good, attentive service. plus they have a little shop with peruvian gifts, including an incas vs. spanish chess game, fluffy mini-llamas, and bright woven goods."
"2","I really love this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised it isn't more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not even a salad person. I think my favorite dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front."
"2","Lovely, refreshing food, though the menu gets a bit old. Perfect, unique salad dressing. Must try it!"
"2","While I'm not going to crave this food, it was pretty good.  It tasted like home-made Peruvian food, not that I've ever had Peruvian food, or been in the home of a Peruvian.  But it is what I imagine I would have eaten if I grew up in Lima.\n\nI think it's a very reasonable alternative on the Walnut Street strip, especially if you don't want to shell out the $$$ for Panagea or Girasole."
"1","Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special, which was better, but still unimpressive. Realize it was only 12$ for dinner, and yet somehow still entirely not worth it."
"1","Unimpressed.  Food is okay, and service is good, but it's just not that great.\n\nThe food alone would be 4 stars if they were charging a bit less (Yes - I think value matters.  Almost anyone can serve you an above-average meal if price isn't an issue.)  The empanada was pretty good, but $3.50 for a tiny little beef empanada is ridiculous.  They're street food, for chrissake.  (The pickled onion condiment with them is really good, though.)  I had the tortilla de papa, which was pretty good, and my partner had a chicken dish (name escapes me) that was pretty good as well, and the salads were good.  \n\nBack to the pricing thing: they do have Inca Kola, which I love, but they charge $2.50 for a can.  I only got one because my partner had never had one, but $2.50?  Really?  I know the profit's in the drinks for restaurants, but a 12-pack of it cost the same as a 12 of Coke the last time I saw it in a grocery store.\n\nService was good.  Very friendly.  4 stars.\n\nDecor leaves much to be desired.  This is usually an area that doesn't bug me too much with restaurants, but this place looks ratty - worn carpet, cheap tile, faded pictures of someone's trip to Peru, furniture that looks like it belongs in a chain motel breakfast room.  The knickknacks for sale are nice, but they're not in a separate area, so it feels like you're eating in the middle of a gift shop.  Again, not awful if you're charging $5-7 or so per plate, but not when you've crossed the $10 threshold.  1 star.\n\nI'm split between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm skewing low on this place."
"2","I would recommend this place for a quick lunch. I ordered the non-vegetarian special of the day, cilantro chicken with rice, french bread, and salad. The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but it still had great flavor. My meal was $11 (pre-tax and tip) which I thought was fair considering that the salad was extremely fresh and there was a decent amount of meat."
"2","Something told me to be adventuresome when my first choice for lunch was closed for the day.  I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon here.  I saw Pamela's and thought oh well, if I can have breakfast for dinner, why not try breakfast for lunch.  When I walked in I saw the sign for the upstairs eatery and it piqued my interest.  \n\nI can honestly say I have no clue as to what Peruvian food is and even though I partook in this delicious place I still have no concept into the food except that it tastes amazing.  We were seated almost immediately with menus in hand.  For lunch this place was not busy in the least.  Too bad for everyone else, because this is a great place to have lunch.  I skimmed the menu but the specials board is what really caught my attention.  I cannot remember the name of what I ate, but who cares, because it tasted so good that almost right after I finished my plate, short of licking it clean, I wanted more of the special!  The special was chicken atop cheese curd and then topped itself with pesto.  What an ideal combination of flavors.  The special also came with rice I believe and the house salad.  The salad was mixed greens with a combination of olives, walnuts and carrots.  The dressing was the house dressing and not too heavy or tangy.\n\nOur server seemed a little inexperienced, but I won't hold that against her.  I am going to assume that she didn't know much about Peruvian food either.  Even though she really couldn't answer a lot of our questions about the food, she was swift and made sure we were taken care of.  \n\nThey also have shelves of Peruvian items that you can purchase if you are so inclined to do so.  I did not while I was here, but it does give you something interesting to look at and start a conversation about during your meal."
"1","I came here with a friend last Feb., and chose to visit it based on the positive reviews and the uniqueness of Peruvian food (I don't know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh that serves it).  Unfortunately, what I experienced was mediocre food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced.\n\nMy dining companion and I were seated promptly.  After 10 min., the waitress came over and asked about drinks.  After another 10 min., she brought our drinks and asked what we wanted to order.  I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.\n\nIt took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.  Also, none of the people working there seemed to be Peruvian, which is never a good sign in an ethnic eatery.  Based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon."
"1","If you can't find this place, it's because it's above Pamela's.  I liked all the crafts in here.  It was cute, lots of different things, colorful clothes, toy llamas, etc.  But, I really came here for the Peruvian food.\n\nIf you are looking for Papas a la Huancaina or ceviche, it isn't here.  It's salads, sandwiches, empanadas, and a few other entrees like arroz tapado.  \n\nThis is a good place for a healthy lunch but I would not come here for dinner.  After looking at the menu and nothing jumped at me, I got the empanada platter.  It was...ok.  Not that amazing.  I got the beef, the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas.  The cilantro wasn't even that prevalent in the chicken empanada.  My spinach empanada was comparable to a less flaky spanakopita.  The beef empanada need more flavor!  Sigh.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this place.\n\nI will say, the coffee was good and the server was very pleasant.  This is a nice place to get some cool gifts."
"1","I've had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place (several hundred dollars worth). He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place."
"1","They always take weeks to get things done & overcharged. I was ok with that when they did a good job. But then they stopped doing a good job. Not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job."
"1","I've been there twice to have dress clothes tailored. The first was for a full suit and a pair of pants. The owner said to return the following Saturday, which I did, and he did not have them ready. Not only that, but he acted like it was my fault I showed back up on time. \n\nSecond time same deal, two pairs of pants, not done on time and when they were done they were not tailored correctly. I'll be going out of my way to a different tailor from now on. \n\nIn addition, the prices are on the very high side without the service or results."
"1","I brought two pairs of pants and two (cheap) blazers there to be altered.  He was very nice. However, he failed to mention to me that the cost of these 4 things- one of which only needed alternation tape- would come to $96!!!!!!  When I came to pick up my items I was extremely embarrassed because I had to tell him I could not afford it. He then told me he could \""help me out \"" and make it $80.  I tried explaining to him that the two blazers were only $25 each to begin with.  Overall, this was an extremely humiliating experience and it all could have been solved if he were more professional and would have told me that simple alterations would cost so much.  I will definitely be searching for a new tailor in the future.  Way too expensive if you ask me."
"1","I went there to get my dress hemmed last Wednesday and he said the next Thursday and when I went it to get it the day it was supposed to be done, he hadn't even started and he told me he was working on it right now which was a bold face lie. And when I went back to get it, he charged me for 30 for a simple dress hemming. It is such a rip off. I won't ever go back there."
"2","I've had many suits, pants, and sport coats altered here. Rocky is a very nice guy who gets things done on time and does great work!\n\nIt would be a little more convenient if the establishment wasn't cash only, but in my experience the best places are."
"1","I went to Molnar's for a state inspection and an oil change.  I dropped off the car that day.  Later, a mechanic called me to tell my my check engine light was on.  He said it'll cost $99 to do a diagnostic to pull the codes to find out what's wrong (FYI, the actual code reader cost $20 online).  I gave the Ok.  He found two problems and it would have cost another $400 to fix it.  I asked him to just fix one of the two problems since I couldn't afford both.  He seemed a bit annoyed that I wasn't doing both repairs and kept repeating to me that it won't get rid of the engine light.  \n\nThree weeks later, on a Thursday, I came back to get the rest of the problems fix.  The same mechanic said the parts needed to be ordered from the dealership and it will be here Monday at the latest.  He said he'll call me when the parts come in.\n\nOn the following Tuesday, I decided to call him since I haven't heard anything from him.  He told me he didn't put the order through because he forgot.  He told me he had a rough weekend.  Told me that he'll order it right away, and reminded me that it takes a few days like he \""told me before.\""  This time around, he did call me and let me know the parts were in.  He also gave me an estimate that was $100 higher than the previous estimate.  He asked me to bring in my car on a day he's working.  I said that I needed the car by 5pm as I needed the car for work.  He said it was no problem and that I'll be the first car he'll work on when he comes in.  He said he'll put me down for an appointment.\n\nOn the day we agreed, I went to drop off my car.  No one was there yet except for the owner(i think).  I told him I got an appointment to drop off my car for the mechanic to work on.  He looked through his book and didn't see my name and let out an annoyed sigh.  He took my info and I gave him my keys.  I told him I needed the car ASAP.  He replied, \""Yeah, everyone does.\""  At which point, I pointed out that the mechanic said he'll do it ASAP for me.  He just ignored me.\n\nLater that day, I got the call from the mechanic, telling me he ran into a problem.  Stripped bolts were preventing him from removing the part.  Told me he'll have to break surrounding parts to remove it and those surrounding parts will need to be replace because of it.  He said it was too big of a job for him and I should take it to a dealership.  He then added that the dealership ....sent him the wrong parts anyways....\n\nI ended up getting the repair done at the dealership and got my state inspection.  Guess what?  There were no stripped bolts.  No surrounding parts needed to be broken.  I think I was lied to because he ordered the wrong parts and didn't want to be bothered with getting it right.\n\nIn my opinion, Molnar's mechanic and owner are very unorganized.  Their communication skills need serious work, with the customers and between themselves.  I will admit, I had no issues with the oil change and the first repair they did.  But the hassle and the amount of time I spent trying to get repairs done through them wasn't worth the time.  I hate giving a business one-star, but they deserve it."
"2","I've visited Molnar Service Center many times. My first visit was to have my VIN number verified for car registration, and Molnar's took care of me very quickly! I was in and out in under five minutes. \n\nMy second visit was to get my car inspected. I dropped my car off in the morning and it was finished that afternoon. I wasn't going to be able to arrive by the time the shop closed, so they made arrangements so I could pick up my car after hours.\n\nMy third visit was this week. I had a hissing noise that turned out to be a vacuum leak in the pump for my power breaks. The pump had to be replaced and the part needed to be ordered. It was estimated that my car would be finished by Friday afternoon. But they finished it by Thursday afternoon!\n\nI feel like I always get great service at Molnar's. They always explain the problem, and have always finished on schedule or ahead of schedule for me. My car will always go to Molnar's for service."
"1","This business closed July 31st 2014!!"
"2","I recently took my engagement ring into The Collection for resizing and I had a very nice experience there. The ring belonged to my fiance's great grandmother and has a delicate setting and band. My ring finger is a good deal smaller than the ring's past owner, however, and the ring needed to be sized down from a 7 to a 3 and 3/4. I was a bit worried that such a large reduction would alter the shape and/or design of the ring. However it all worked out beautifully. Karen and everyone else in the shop were all very kind and provided lots of information. The job took less than two hours and the price was very reasonable. I am hoping to return there to have our wedding rings made."
"1","They work quickly, but speed isn't worth it if the final product is damaged."
"2","i think this is the right place.. near the shopping center? kind of a hole in the wall? i was a little put off by how dirty the place seemed, but the pizza was DELICIOUS. nice and crispy, just like i like it. not stingy on the toppings while not overwhelming the pizza either."
"2","Thank you to Bonnie T. who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S. Aiken Ave.  I will leave my review there!  BTW that move also came with a name change - they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille.\n\nI was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed.  When I read that they had moved - I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'."
"1","I'm taking the previous poster's advice and contacting the BBB.\n\nAfter nearly 5 hellish years with Mozart, this week I received a notice from them stating that they weren't renewing my lease.\n\nWhen I called the only incident they pointed to as an explanation was because I warned my neighbors of the peeping Tom that was masturbating outside of our windows on the fire escape. There are numerous young college aged females that live in the building and Mozart refused to install motion lighting of any kind. After the 3rd incident I contacted an attorney, warned every tenant with a notice and threatened to contact the media if they didn't do anything about it. They still refuse to install motion detected lighting, there are just very dim fluorescent lights out there now instead.\n\nMozart then began updating my apartment on the guise that they were bettering it for me, when in actuality they were doing it so they could show it to others. They put in new floors and a new cabinet -- I even had to stay in a hotel (at my own expense) because of the dust, dirt and lack of a floor in my bathroom! I posted a picture showing my bathroom one day when I needed to \""go.\""\n\nToday, I posted an art mosaic that I was sure to point out when they were showing my apartment. The mosaic, posted inside my apartment, provides ample warning that this apartment came with \""strings attached\"" -- a sexual deviant.\n\nI posted a photo of the art mosaic on my facebook page too, for you to see as well:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=42421164&l=67fe64e8eb&id=14209556\n\nIt says:\n\n\n\nFUTURE TENANT (S): \n\nTHIS APARTMENT COMES WITH A PEEPING TOM.\n\nI m not allowed to renew my lease because I warned all of the other tenants in the building after the 3rd incident of him masturbating outside my window.

"1","If I could, I would give this poor excuse for a managment company \""0\"" stars.  I've barely in my place for 2 weeks and have had all sorts of problems.  Let's see the second day I moved in, the bathroom ceiling started to leak and then ultimately fell.  I was told that upon the initial complaint of the leak, that this was \""normal\"" and that it was a result from the upstairs neighbors not fully closing their shower curtain.\n\nI'm not sure if this maintenance guy thought he was talking to a total moron, but somehow I doubt that a few sprinkles coming out from a bathtub in the above unit b/c the shower curtain didn't close all the way would cause a rain-like down pour in my bathroom.  I promptly contacted the management company during normal business hours and they came in and put a temporary board up until they could fix the problem.\n\nI stressed to them to please resolve the leak as replacing the ceiling wouldn't fix the real problem.  They said that they would look into it and replaced the ceiling but still needed to do a paint job and some plastering to seal the edges.  I waited a week to see if they would do the \""final\"" touches to the bathroom.  They didn't so I had to call them to see if they were ever coming back to paint the wall that was ruined by the water damage.  They told me that they would try to get around to it but they have lots of units they have to work on...ummm so when did it become ok to do a half-assed job and leave a tenant with no time frame on when it would be completely done.  \n\nI figured I would follow-up with them regarding the final touches to the bathroom when low and behold the ceiling near the front door fell without warning, and from my perspective no reason at all.  If someone had been standing there, this would have caused serious injury.  This happened on a Saturday so I called and someone came to put temporary board up.  \n\nI planned on contacting them during normal business hours (M-F 9-5) to make sure that someone would be fixing the ceiling when I noticed the the bathroom ceiling (that they had just replaced) is starting to get discolored b/c of the leak.  So it's just a matter of time before the bathroom ceiling falls again since they failed to correct the source of the problem which is the leak that I had explicitly mentioned.  \n\nSo if you want to move in to a place that is falling apart you should definitely move into their apartments.  I just can't imagine having to deal with this a year .  I already know that I will NOT renew my lease or EVER rent from this management company again.  \n\nAlso fyi - don't bother calilng the emergency number b/c they'll either tell you there's nothing wrong or not show up at all.  This happened twice to me so far within a two week time frame."
"1","I lived in The Pennsylvanian for one year.  It was so intolerable that I moved a month early and just ate the cost.\n\nThe pluses: from a distance, the apartments are decent. and the maintenance staff is always around.\n\nThe minus: the maintenance staff is always around.  As in, they took daily lunch and gab fests directly outside of the my living room window in the courtyard.  I'm not trying to be an elitist, but I would have liked to have been able to use the table right outside of my apartment in peace.  \n\nAdditionally, they do random pest control, which is an excuse to snoop in your apartment.  Once, they found \""a used pot soaking in soapy water and a teapot on the stove\"" (verbatim from the letter they sent me), which was considered \""unhygienic.\""  This was a search they did without any warning to me and while I was at class.  I'm obsessively clean and generally didn't even leave any dishes soaking ever and I keep my CLEAN teapot on the stove since I make tea often.  It was insulting, and to make it worse, they insisted that they had to come back once a week for the next three weeks to check on my sink's cleanliness.  Whoever had \""inspected\"" my apartment had rummaged in all of my drawers.  I then had a real estate lawyer friend remind Mozart of my rights, and they didn't bother me again until I moved out early--they were upset I was leaving the apartment \""abandoned,\"" even though I had paid the rent through the end of the lease.\n\nFurthermore, they absolutely refused to tell me when they would be spraying for these so-called pests, which I believe is why they started doing the \""inspections\""--to spite me.  Their staff is horribly rude that way.  After they posted a sign about spraying for pests, I went into their office with a note from my physician explaining I have very serious asthma and needed to know what they were spraying and when so I could go somewhere else for a couple days.  They said I was hindering their pest control, and then started the weekly inspections of my apartment.  This was after they randomly showed up unannounced and re-finished my bathtub while I was in class, and just left a note saying I couldn't shower for 2 days on the door.  The smell was so strong that I would have had to leave for that long anyhow.  Hence, why I asked about the pest spraying.\n\nThe dry wall from the ceiling fell suddenly in large chunks all over my bedroom once, and it took 2 days to fix and they left dry wall dust all over my room (this was after I had cleaned up from the first dry wall).\n\nIncidentally, the first person they showed my apartment to took it, and the realtor thanked me profusely for having a such a nice set-up that it made it so much easier to rent than the \""messy\"" units...I'm guessing places with TWO dirty pots in the sink."
"1","I still get nightmares from just seeing Mozart management signs on\nBuildings anywhere in Pittsburgh."
"2","I have lived at Mozart for 3 years now. Like anywhere else, there are pros and cons. Pro's first. I like to live a very quiet life. I work from home and I value my privacy. Mozart has always been good, and now has improved on that. When Maintenance comes I get warning, if there's a hazard or problem it gets fixed fast and usually at my choice of day and time, and the OUTSIDE is gorgeous. The guys who work and garden.... they do a meticulous, and fantastic job. So often people who do \"" Small jobs\"" are forgotten so they don't work hard. But house keeping, gardening, and the fix it guys are always respectful, friendly, and are highly knowledgeable.  \n\nCons: Rent.... goes up every year to almost a ridiculous amount. I live in a studio and without utilities besides water and heat) it's over 600. However: I get this is a business and anything money related Mozart is a stickler on. Still: if they did some rent control... they could keep some really good clients. Sometimes I think that gets forgotten.  I'll have to leave next year, and who knows, I might rent another place w these guys.  But for now, I'm going to make the best of my time."
"1","Terrible! \n\nI'm pretty sure I am the apartment above Serena R's review.  The time frame matches up well.  \n\nI moved in around August 2010 to a first floor apartment (with a lower level Apartment below me)  Within the first weeks of my arrival, maintenance people were at my door nearly every time I tried to shower.   \n\nI'm a young girl, living alone, with guys unceremoniously entering MY HOME every time my shower leaks!   Originally, they tried to convince me I wasn't closing my shower curtain... but then a started collecting crocks full over debris and water from behind the shower plumbing access door.  THEY tried to convince me that cups full were purely pipe condensation.   It took 6 months for them to resolve this situation. At one point, they even asked me NOT to use the shower.  \n\nA year later, the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak.  The wall began to crack and before long a grotesque, pink mold covered the backside of the layers of tan paint that fell from my walls and ceiling.  I was spending most of time out of town with a family illness when I noticed this happening.  When I stopped by the office to pay my rent, I talked to 3 people about what was happening... nothing was corrected UNTIL they started showing my apartment to potential tenants.  \n\nI used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired."
"1","Mozart Mgmt was the first landlord I have ever had. I rented a studio apartment, it was great for a 20 y/o part time student- however, not even 6 hours after moving in, I noticed a huge roach infestation crawling out of the ceiling. I have never in my life seen anything like it. I called the emergency line, and the guy assured me that they would have someone come over. No one ever came. I called 2-3 more times before giving up and going back to my mum's house. The following day I s/w the property manager who was very kind and helpful- agreed to reimburse me for 3 days worth of rent while they treated my apartment, and the entire building. They continued to f/u on my apartment until the end of my lease. The good thing about Mozart is that they care about the upkeep of their properties. The annoying thing- actually a HUGE problem for me was, the constant visits/interruptions in my apartment. I understand a few maintenance visits every now and then, but these people would come to my apartment sometimes 7 times a week for one thing or another. Also, b/c there was a roach problem, they would regularly inspect my apartment for \""cleanliness\"". Ummm...newsflash, I didn't bring roaches to your property! Those things were clearly left by a previous tenant, but I'm the one being monitored for cleanliness? Another thing, Mozart staff are very friendly WHILE you're a tenant, when you decide not to renew your lease- yes, they make you decide in Feb if you're going to renew in August- they send you an almost threatening letter telling when/how to vacant. They also have prospective tenants viewing your apartments 7 days a week...morning...Sunday? They don't c are. Most times they will give you notice- but still, for a student that doesn't have classes and wants to sleep in at 9am, it can be a real hassle have to get up and leave your apartment."
"1","Pros: Good location (Melwood, Dakota building), utilities included, they sweep the hallways.\n\nCons: Management was extremely rude and condescending when I had a problem that needed fixing. You have to take care of the A/C units, maintenance doesn't do that unless it is irreparably broken. My shower leaked, but they told me just to turn the knobs tighter ... sure dude. Still leaks. My toilet would run unless I jiggled the handle. When I moved in, I had to mop the floor 7 times to get clean water, the stovetop was caked with food, and oil was everywhere. Of course I cleaned as much to my ability, and then I got a notice saying that I wasn't keeping up with my lease b/c of some girl before me's mess. Sorry, but when the stovetop is brown from her burning shit, and I clean it to something passable, I shouldn't be penalized for this.\n\nAlso, the water was shut off multiple times unannounced, and when I mentioned it and asked if they could just send out a notice, maybe detailing future outages, or even just an email saying how long it would be, I got a snarky reply saying that \""emergencies happen, and blame the City of Pittsburgh because we won't be sending out any emails.\""\n\nNOT worth your money. Find a better management who doesn't take your money and piss on you. I never write reviews, but was so irate that I had to post this. Just treat me with respect, that's all I ask."
"1","I can only comment on the lease application process, but my experience was very negative. They started out easy to work with, but that was short-lived. Scheduling apartment viewing was simple, and the people who showed me the units were relatively friendly. The issue came when I actually went to sign a lease.\n\nI was told on the phone and in person by the person showing me apartments that I would not need a cosigner, but as soon as I showed up for my lease application appointment, they told me I would need a cosigner. I scrambled to contact my mom, who was willing to cosign, but they said they needed BOTH parents to co-sign, and they wanted me to sign an agreement saying I would forfeit the $1000 deposit I had to pay upfront if I did not return all of my cosigners' documents within 7 days. This was an issue because 1 of my parents was out of town for the week. \n\nI tried compromising with them and seeing if they could change the agreement to give me an extra few days to get the cosigner paperwork in, or to see if I could just have my mother (who was more than financially stable) be the sole cosigner. They were unwilling to compromise at all, and I left after about a half hour of unproductive back-and-forth discussion. \n\nI could have gone back a week later, when both parents were in town, as the unit was still available, but I figured any place that difficult to work with when I was trying to give them money would be even more frustrating once I was contacting them for things like maintenance requests. I wouldn't say \""never ever rent from them\"", but I would definitely be aware of how rude / difficult they can be."
"1","I lived in Mozart's Highmont apartment for the past two years. \n\nThe rent is too damn high. It was $730 including utilities when I moved in. If you sign a lease now it's $830. It has hardwood floors... In between the gaping crevices in the floor and splinters galore. The kitchen appliances are 3/4 size so your oven will not accept 11\""X13\"" baking pans and the eyes of your stove are too close to cook more than two items at a time.\n\nThis past winter was very snowy, and Mozart waits until the 23rd hour after snowfall to shovel and salt the walkways, so be prepared to have several near-death experiences getting down the two flights of steep stairs (with short, flimsy, definitely not to code railing). \n\nThey sometimes creep in for inspections, then give you a 'B' without telling you what they didn't like. Aside from inspections, maintenance is really quick for all those pesky problems with the plumbing. The bathtub and sink drip constantly which would be concerning if utilities weren't included. The air conditioning is weak, the heat is hellish and there is very little temperature control since your windows are painted shut.  \n\nThe laundry room is coin operated, it costs $1.75 to wash and to 'dry'. Your clothes will still be soaking wet from the dryer (yes even on high with a clean lint trap). Also be wary of the washers, sometimes people leave them nasty so do a sniff test and a visual inspection before you put your clothes in. The hallways smell like hot garbage, always. They will only be vacuumed shortly after move in in August and right before people start coming to view the apartments in February.\n\nAlso, since the utilities are included, your name isn't on them which means:\n1. When you move on, the utility companies want to say you have no history with them because your name is not on the account.\n2. When Duquesne Light plays with power grid and knocks out your electricity for two days during a 95+ degree heat wave causing misery and spoiling all of your groceries so you are forced to go to the food pantry for months afterward, you can't do anything or be repaid for your losses because of #1. \n\nOne last thing, there is a parking lot, but it costs $75 a month to park back there or you can park on a side street for free and walk 3 blocks with your arms full of groceries. And they will tow you! I was towed within 2 hours after parking back there at (10pm). So park tail-in if you need to use the lot quickly because the tow truck will have to switch equipment to ruin your day.\n\nTL:DR Value for apartment is not great considering all of the other b.s."
"1","One of the worst mgmt companies i have ever dealt with.  The policies in their building are obviously very outdated but they refuse to make themselves better to serve their clients.  As long as they can wipe their hands clean, they are ok with it.  One aspect that they are great at is dishing off responsibility and making zero effort to give the tenants a better experience.  Mgmt does not think how to resolve the issue, instead they will cite a policy to justify why they cannot help you."
"1","Mozart Management - Georgian on Ellsworth - AWFUL BUILDING\n\nI have maintained video proof of all my miserable experiences living in my unit on the first floor for almost three months so far, and have provided proof of a couple of them here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8llYlRPz2Qm7ovPQWSlyA\n\nThis is the NOISIEST place I've ever lived, and I read ALL bad reviews posted about them previously, and what every single person before me wrote is completely and 100% accurate.  \n\nMozart Management rented me and apartment on the ground floor directly across from the Maintenance Room/Office.  I had no disclosure of this whatsoever when I signed my lease.  There is no sign on the door, no evidence that this is where I would be renting a unit, or I'd have never signed a lease for this.  \n\nYou will hear every single floor board in this building, whether it's above or beneath you.  The maintenance crew is helpful, they are NOISY and completely awful to live by.  Due to my location in the building, I hear them all day long, every single day, clearly from my unit because there is a lack of insulation.  \n\nThey are often heckling and telling personal stories down the hall to one another, and I almost feel like I know more about their personal lives than I do of my own.  I don't even understand how they have the time for this.  The phone in the office rings all day long (also sounds like it's coming from my apartment, that's how loud it is) and I also get to hear every conversation made through walkie-talkies.  Every single day I hear the same man coughing and blowing his nose in the office as if he were sitting on my sofa doing it.  It's absolutely disgusting, and you get no peace whatsoever.\n\nAlso, my apartment unit sounds like a construction unit on any given day.  On the other side of the hallways, something else I was never informed of, is some sort of tool room.  I often hear saws, drills, vaccuums, you name it.  All day long.\n\nMozart has made an effort to calm the crew down for inappropriate content, but it's still not enough for my unfortunate apartment location.  My family and I did our research about this matter and it really is up to a rental company to first and foremost to provide a tenant with a peaceful and safe environment.  I never feel at peace here, and as a single female living solo, I am feeling less and less safe as I've become aware of having to share such close quarters with older men every single day that I do not know.  We asked kindly to be released from this lease, but Mozart feels they should be compensated from ME, even though they were creeps about disclosing the truth about this apartment.  Now, I am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost. \n\n\nI REALLY wanted to like Mozart despite all of the bad reviews.  I'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review.  But what the other renters have said IS true; Mozart's SOLE concern is about money, not the comfort or satisfaction of their customers.  They are untrustworthy, know they are untrustworthy, and are completely comfortable with being unethical.\n\nFor the amount of rent paid here (I pay $860 a month for a 1-bed), I've learned you can find a similar, possibly even lower deal, right around the same area in a much more peaceful building."
"2","I have lived in the Pennsylvania building for over 3 months now and I felt a need to counter act all these negative reviews I keep seeing on here.\n\nFirstly when I called maintenance to fix anything I would always get a prompt response usually within 24 hours. I remember my mailbox lock needed changed and 2 hours later a maintenance man came up to check and order a new one. \n\nPeople say Mozart has came into their apartment unannounced but that hasn't happened to us yet and Pennsylvania doesn't have a law requiring management companies to notice tenants when they will be coming over. So if you want a company to respect that you'll have to leave the state.  \n\nAll the maintenance, management, and grounds keepers have been very polite and knowledgeable to my roommate and I.\n\nBe sure to read all of the lease before signing. They have all the information in their leases."
"1","Okay I wrote my previous review when I was mad at them for breaking into my apartment. I want to provide a more complete and responsible review now, so people know what to expect for living at Mozart.\n\n1. READ THE LEASE. I have to put this in capitals because I didn't. It's very long, so I didn't bother. I thought, how bad could it be? I've lived in various apartments during college and everything was peaceful. You just have to look at how much you have to pay each month and what the deadline is, and some other stuff like lost keys and maintenance. Mozart's lease lists out at least a dozen things that they can fine you with, and the prices are ridiculous. On the top of my mind, there are full month's rent for refusing uninformed inspection, full month's rent for not returning keys on time, $500 for any animal, 3 month's rent for moving out before the original date of leave, if you \""move out\"" because you died your relatives are required to pay that 3 months rent... And there's a policy that states that by signing this contract you waive your legal rights according to (some law that I forgot). I don't have time to bring this to court but I don't think it's legal to make such a contract.\n\n2. They provide almost zero service. We once called them for clogging in the sink and bathtub, and maintenance showed up for the first time over a week later. And it took about a month to actually get it fixed. I think there was a 3 day period where we weren't allowed to shower to fix the problem. And there was also this time when maintenance showed up in the morning when I was in the shower. They told my roommate that they'll come back next week if I can't get out of the shower immediately. Also I think there was this time last winter when the heating broke down and we wrote them an email, and they said \""we don't take responsibility in alarming you of things like this. I would advice you to shut the windows firmly and use blankets to block where wind might blow in.\"" What? My neighbor moved out after 2 months of living in mozart because of things like this. Mozart gave no shit about his quality of life living there or anything they could do to make stuff less of a problem. He had to pay a fine equivalent to 3 months rent ($3000+), but he moved out with no hesitation.\n\n3. They are extremely rude. I remember explaining something to them in email for an expensive fine that I didn't think was my fault. And they replied in a middle school bully tone which basically said \""we don't care what your circumstances were. you owe us a grand. shut up and pay asap\"". So I replied in demand for an explanation for their attitude, and my next couple of emails were responded by three different person, each saying the previous went out on vacation. Lol yeah. And I can't remember the circumstance, it was either moving or parking or cleaning, but I swear I've been called an idiot to the face by one of their people. They might seem polite when they're trying to sell you the place, but they'll show their true disrespectful nature when any conflict arise. If you can deal with that, welcome to mozart. Later a friend told me that it's probably because that the fine is $1000+ that they're so determined to milk that money out of you without listening to any explanation you might rightfully have and going as far as to insult you to sound firm.\n\n4. Oh, by the way, I don't think they really know their place. They were showing the place to some potential tenants, and they were pointing at stuff that we brought in and said it comes with the apartment. I had to tell the ppl seeing the place that it wasn't true, that the microwave, wardrobe, mirrors were actually all ours. I'm really surprised the guy showing the place didn't call me an idiot in the face right there lol. Anyway, I'm saying this, if they look nice at your first encounter (especially if that's before you sign the lease and everything), don't believe it. They'll never be as nice after you sign, unless you get a perfect room with no problems and you never talk to any of their staff.\n\n5. The price might look okay, but it really isn't. I think my rent was a bit over 1000 for 2 people, but utilities are not included, parking is not included, and they have the highest laundry fee I've ever seen. Plus, they fine you a grand for the most trivial things. So think about how much you actually have to pay to live in such a bad place.\n\nAnyway, I'm very happy that I moved out. If you are thinking about living there, DON'T. It's gonna be a nightmare."
"2","Mozart Management  is great! They have been extrememly professional and considerate the whole time I have rented. I have been renting for years and they are the best property management company I've had. Stacey, the property manager, has been very responsive any email I send her and goes out of her way to make tenants' lives easier. I couldn't ask for anything more out of a property management company."
"1","Absolutely horrible. My sink has been overflowing onto my countertops and ruining my belongings multiple times. Management did not even apologize for my inconvenience."
"2","When damaging your liver it's best to use only the freshest and best quality ingredients and if you want to do some serious damage then you should definitely check out Mardi Gras.  \n\nThey freshly squeeze the oranges and grapefruits in front of you for your Screwdrivers and Greyhounds so you don't have to worry about nasty impurities from the fruit juice ruining your cocktail.  Why make your liver work harder than it already has to."
"2","Strong drinks, dark and smoky, cozy booths, great juke box.  This is a bar, this is your neighborhood bar.  If you need to meet someone for a drink and just talk it out - this is the place.  A good friend of mine always points out the ugly carpet.  Yep, the carpet here is ugly, but at least it is new.  And the place is dark so you never really see the carpet anyways."
"2","So Mardi Gras was usually a must stop whenever I went out on a Friday or Saturday night in Shadyside during college. This bar is more of an older crowd but they do serve drinks the way I usually make mine. If you order a jack and coke, you'll be lucky if you can even taste the coke. They pretty much give you a glass of jack and a splash of coke. We used to get very very drunk here. The place is really small so you're lucky to see an open table, grab it. \n\nThe bartenders are older and they don't take credit card so bring cash. The drinks are also a little more expensive for Pittsburgh. However, this is the only place in the area that has Delirium Tremens on tap.\n\nThey don't serve food here either so plan on getting messed up if you don't eat anything before you go. The bar is very dark but a lot of my friends love this place and whenever alumni came back, we would definitely go here and make them pay for our drinks. All in all, a very good place to pregame or just to hang out and socialize."
"1","Good luck getting out\nWith your soul and belongings.\nBring your own flashlight.\n\n\n(b)"
"2","Some serious old school 80's glamour waits up the long flight of stairs to Marti Gras.  There's something magical about this dive--even the smoke doesn't seem to bother me...Actually, it's probably the strong drinks that are responsible for that...Which may be made with magic.  Who can say?  But I'm a sucker for any sort of sweet vodka cocktail in a martini glass, and the drinks here will knock a girl off her heels.  Luckily, there's always an attentive bartender waiting to mix one more cocktail.\n\nBut this ain't no college dive.  You won't find too many kids in here, which I appreciate.  It's dark up those stairs and the jukebox jazz is often questionable, but the booths are cozy and the drinks are tall and the beer selection is more than decent.  I'll take it.\n\nP.S. - It was cash only last time I checked."
"2","This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh! The drinks will punch you in the face, if that weird looking guy next to you won't. It's a great escape from the bro-scene that is most of Walnut St. and they have booths which themselves would be enough to make me love this place. I've had many sloppy nights here and made many stranger friends. Order a greyhound and watch the bartender squeeze fresh juice into your drink and kick it with strangers at the bar."
"2","Do you want to be shitface drunk off of one drink and you only have $10?  go to Mardis Gras.\n\nTheir drinks are military grade weapons, that is how strong they are.  This bar is unlike every other bar in shadyside.  it's dark and it has cool round booths.\n\nthe bartender should be a national treasure, he is awesome.\n\nbring cash, you can't use your card there.\n\nOh--you will smell like smoke when you leave, this place is full of smoke.  It's likely the least sexy bar in all of pgh but its one of my favorites."
"1","Wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks.  The bartender told us they were known for they fruity drinks, but not margaritas.  He could mix any juice with vodka.  We left."
"2","If someone has not heard of Le Mardi Gras, I just assume they aren't well versed in Pittsburgh drinking culture. This is one of the best bars in the city. Their drinks are remarkably strong, easily on par with Lefty's in the Strip. As a matter of fact, I really don't recommend having more than four or five Mardi Gras cocktails. They will kick your ass.\n\nThis is one of the only bars in the city where I will walk in and just tell the bartender to make whatever whiskey drink he feels like making. I realize this might not sound like a big deal, but I have serious trust issues when it comes to bars. There are only about twenty six bars worldwide where I will even consider ordering  a Manhattan or a Martini. \n\nOne of the best kept Le Mardi Gras secrets is that on Sunday they offer free food to their patrons. Even though we visited on a Thursday, the owner, Rich, was kind enough to put some food out for us. These little touches are what make Mardi Gras more than just a bar.\n\nHere are some of my favorite Le Mardi Gras features: smoking, table top pacman, excellent juke box, fantastic bartenders, intimate seating, dark ominous ambiance and lively patrons. According to Le Mardi Gras' website they've also hosted a variety of celebrities including Rocky Marciano, Harvey Kietel, Sammy Koufax, Sam McDowell, Billy Conn, Alice Cooper, George Clooney, Russell Crowe and Ted Danson."
"2","Super super strong drinks. Very smoky and small, but definitely worth coming to."
"1","."
"2","In general, I am not a fan of Shadyside bars. Le Mardi Gras may be in Shadyside, but it is something else entirely.\n\nMardi Gras is a true dive bar, and not just compared to what's around it--this would be divey in any neighborhood. Drinks are cash only, there's a perpetual haze of smoke, and you'd better be an expert at navigating dim lighting if you hope to not trip over anyone. None are especially bad things. And in fact, the pros of Mardi Gras far outweigh these things. Great big booths, friendly bartenders, free wifi, and strong drinks.\n\nSpeaking of drinks: are you into fresh-squeezed juices? Do you like strong drinks? I mean really strong. Play it safe. Try a Greyhound, but make sure you have a designated driver. The bartenders almost take pride in the strength.\n\nAll in all, it's an authentic dive in a neighborhood that sorely needs one. Grab your cash, and bottoms up!"
"1","We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes, but these just don't taste good.  On top of it all, the coffee was horrible.  \n\nTry DeLuca for a diner experience or Crepe Parisiennes for a good crepe and coffee instead."
"2","Pamela's is an East End institution.  Let's face it: if you've grown up, went to school or currently live in the area, you've probably spent a Sunday devoring forkfuls of Pamela's unique and delicious brand of pancake.  They are thin, crepe-like a little on the greasy side (in a good way). Quick service make up for the long lines.  Weekend specials are a must have.  My favorite is  the chocolate chip banana pancakes.  There is no place like Pamela's, anywhere."
"2","Yes, the line runs out the door but you better believe it is worth the wait.  We had a table of three and we waited no longer than 10 minutes.  The chocolate chip banana pancakes are heavenly!! Everything comes out quick, fast and in a hurry which is imperative when you get into this place and your mouth starts drooling over your neighbors' meals.  The coffee is just so-so but honestly who cares in this case.  Enjoy!!"
"2","Best breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit."
"1","Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is often a line in the morning on nice weekend days. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \""I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\""."
"2","Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette, home fries, and rye toast, and it still kept me full from 11, when I had brunch, to 9PM!  Usually I hate homefries, but these were great!  I think I can only go here like once a year though, to prevent my heart from exploding."
"2","The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times."
"2","delicate and fluffy jussssssst the way i like 'em! \n\nwait wasnt tooo bad (5-10 min maybe). its short if its just 2 ppl.\n\ni had the choc chip cookie pancake - melts in your mouth son!\n\ndef put me into a nice cozy nap mood tho. peep it out at least once."
"2","New life goal: eat at every Pamela's in Pittsburgh.\n\nJustifiably famous for their hotcakes, Pamela's is probably one of the best diners ever. Even when Obama visited the 'Burgh last year he stopped in. By the cashier, there's a picture of him flashing a giant smile, flanked by whom I'm assuming are the owners. (He went to the one on the Strip -- I asked.)\n\nThis particular location is in the Walnut Street shopping district, and it's not terribly large. It's not as funky as the Oakland area Pamela's, but the food is just as good. Upstairs is an unrelated Peruvian shop/cafe, which doesn't seem to serve food on Sundays.\n\nAt about 11:30 AM Sunday morning, on Valentine's Day no less, the wait here was only half an hour. Not bad! The crowd seemed to have doubled by the time my party and I left. Originally we had wanted to go to the Oakland one but it was a total mob scene and tried this location instead.\n\nThe Food: \nFattening, delicious, huge and cheap: every diner should aspire to this! They don't serve lunch specials on Sundays, which is fine because all we wanted were the hotcakes! We all got breakfast specials ($6.75 for 2 eggs any style, 2 hotcakes and ham or sausage or bacon) and were allowed to substitute home fries or toast for the meat options. For $2 extra you could substitute a specialty hotcake. \n\nHUGE HUGE HUGE PORTIONS. Two separate gigantic dinner plates were needed for 1) eggs and home fries and 2) hotcakes which took up the entire plate. I made the mistake of spreading butter on top of my regular hotcakes, which I didn't realize were already approximately 50% butter in the first place. They're thinner and crispier than your average pancake and a little too salty but still good. The speciality hotcakes are more crepe-like in that they're stuffed with the filling of your choice and whipped cream and then rolled up. Whoa.\n\nCoffee's kind of weak. The servers are the sweetest people you'll ever meet. Cash only."
"1","After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious, except I only ate 1/4 of them since there was a very long hair wrapped around the hot cake.  Pamela's turned out to be a waste of money for me and I left hungry.\n\nThere's nothing THAT great about Pamela's.  It's like breakfast at most any other diner."
"1","Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\n\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\n\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\u00e9 or even Square Caf\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\n\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called \""butter.\"""
"1","Another help wanted sign and closed Memorial day. Ahhh"
"2","The past weekend, I was visiting my bff's in Pittsburgh.  We decided to do Sunday brunch, and I asked bff 1 where she wanted to go - she said she'd heard Pamela's in Shadyside was amazing, and had been dying to go there.  BFF 2 said she had heard all about it and she too had been dying to go, and so it was decided.  \n\nwith hype like that, i was hoping it would live up to expectations.  when we arrived, we put our names on the list and waited for about 10-15 minutes.  Pamela's is pretty small, there are maybe 20 tables - some for only 2, some for 4-tops, but the turn over time seems pretty fast.  we settled in and looked over the menu.  the prices are pretty amazing - you can easily do brunch here for under $10/person.  i ordered the strawberry \""hotcakes\"" which are not actually crepes, despite what reviews here say... but they are a bit thinner than regular pancakes (crepes would be much thinner than this) and rolled up like crepes.  mine were stuffed with sliced strawberry, brown sugar, and usually sour cream (i asked for mine w/o the sour cream - this place is enough of a greasy spoon).  others at the table had the strawberry and blueberry hotcakes.  we also ordered the hash browns for the table to share.  \n\nthe hotcakes are most certainly fried - the edges are greasy and crisp.  delicious to eat!  i think i may have made a mistake ordering no sour cream, b/c the hotcake stuffed with strawberries and dry piles of brown sugar was at times too sweet for me.  next time, i'd ask for very light sour cream or possibly no sour cream and no brown sugar.  the hash browns were amazingly delicious, so buttery and melt in your mouth good.  these were gobbled up by the 3 of us!  the hotcakes were large, and too much for me to finish!  \n\nservice was ok - pamela's is a pretty simple place in that aspect, you see your server when you order and to drop off the check.  aside from that, they stand back and let you marvel at the good food.  i would definitely return to pamela's on my next trip to the 'burgh."
"2","Don't be deceived by the nondescript \""PAMELA'S RESTAURANT\"" sign in the sketchy font out front. The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:\n\n- Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture. \n- Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. \n- Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg. \n- Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.\n\nIt's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing."
"2","Great place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning after drinking way too much. The hotcakes are unbelievable but I am a really big fan of their home fries. I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.\n\nOh. you have to pay with cash. And this location is also pretty packed so there is usually a line up outside. But it's so worth it."
"1","I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews.  I love breakfast, and I am a sucker for corned beef hash (I order it pretty much when it's on a menu).  Sadly, I walked away from my meal with a \""meh\"" feeling.\n\nFirst off, I kept hearing about these pancakes I gotta try.  Well, I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack, right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.  I loved the thin fluffy texture, and the crispy edges were a unique touch, but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter \""pat\"" that comes with them)... It's all I could taste.  Too bad.  People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes... Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time).\n\nMy real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store.  If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes, or the sauteed onion... I would have sworn it came from a can.  Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground... Kinda looked like pet food.  What happened to using chunks of real corned-beef and making the dish look like a hash?\n\nI'm a transplant to pitt and I'm still figuring the place out.  Nevertheless, I'm still looking forward to trying some the other recommended food items... But... If you want really good authentic corned beef hash: Tasty Diner in Silver Spring, MD.  Can't beat it."
"1","I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch, I wasn't that impressed. It is cheap, the service is fast and they serve ample buttery portions of diner food. If you're not hungover, I hope you have a good reason for going. You might as well just eat some grease and rub it all over your face."
"2","Delicious as always.  What more can really be said?  I always get the crepe pancakes with brown sugar and sour cream.  I remember when you could only get them with strawberries, but blueberries are now an excellent alternative.\n\nTheir coffee is as spectacularly terrible as ever.  It's been bad for as long as I can remember, like they're intentionally not serving good coffee.  It's the only thing from keeping Pamela's from being a 5-star breakfast place.  Regardless, Pamela's is still a Pittsburgh classic and always a great breakfast destination."
"2","Everything I wanted to say has already been covered in previous reviews, so I'll just leave it at this:\n\nOH MY GOD GET THE HOTCAKES\n\nSeriously, get them."
"2","Pamela's is certainly a Pittsburgh institution, and for good reason! Of the several locations in the city, the Shadyside spot is my favorite, probably because it was the first Pamela's I ever ate at.  I love breakfast food, but I'm never big on breakfast-only places because they tend to be too small and crowded, and hardly worth the wait.  But Pamela's food is as close to perfection as you'll ever get, so the long line and cramped space isn't even a factor.  Personally, I love their hotcakes, omelets, and hash browns, but everything on the menu is mouth-watering and inexpensive!"
"1","How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed, cheese-like goo and assorted goodness straight out of a can."
"2","Disgustingly amazing breakfast as usual. Order what you want and accept you are done for the day!"
"2","Decent breakfast and great service. I found the much touted corned beef hash to be too salty but everything else we ordered was great. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for breakfast"
"1","We had a terrible breakfast here not long ago. Like many couples in the city, we love to go out every other week or so for a weekend breakfast. This day, it wasn't busy, and the speed of service was good. The French toast was an abomination. The toast had about a quarter inch of egg white formed around the edges, from poorly mixed batter. Plus the bread was poor quality. The bacon...crunchy fleks of the thinnest, most meager bacon these eyes have seen. The crepe pancakes were ok, but nothing to write home about. Years ago I worked for a grumpy penny pincher who had been swindled into buying a 3 year supply of prepackaged coffee, which just sat in our storeroom for years until we brewed it, and cursed it. Van roots, it was. Pamela's, in all the years I Have visited, has consistently challenged van rooy for the worst coffee crown. On top of all the bad food, last week Pamela's earned that crown. We'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future."
"2","Yo! Fucking brown sugar and blueberries in my hotcakes? Legit!"
"2","Definitely a must for any guest. I only sampled the strawberry stuffed crepes, which sound rather ordinary. Rest assured, they were anything but. The crepes are the same as their pancakes, which are light, lacy and crisp around the edges. Perfection by themselves....they come with several fillings and toppings but I decided to go with my wait person's recommendation. The strawberries were sliced paper thin, fresh, not at all syrupy, and there were two, huge, filled crepes on my plate-enough for two people. I asked for the sour cream on the side, and there was a dollop of freshly whipped cream (not instant, I know these things) in the middle of both crepes. Dusted over the top was a thin coat of granulated sugar (it may have been turbinado) and just a hint of course sea salt. The texture and taste was amazing! The menu was interesting with omelets, egg dishes, french toast, and the usual breakfast fare. All that I saw going by looked good, but my recommendation would be, if you go only once, skip all that and go right for a pancake/crepe creation. You will NOT be disappointed. Also, the order came out 1 minute after the wait person brought my coffee; like magic. This place is a jewel in the middle of Walnut Street!"
"2","HOT CAKES.  That's really all I have to say.  I was wondering what the fuss was about, and when I took my first bite, it all made sense.  As for the rest of the breakfast items, they're okay.  I ordered corned beef hash, and it seemed like the kind of corned beef that came from a can.  I could be wrong, but it just didn't have much flavor.  The only annoying thing about this place is the wait.  Get there early or be prepared to wait, outside, for a long while."
"1","I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.\n\nI have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?\n\nMy companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.\n\nAfter perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.\n\nMy companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.\n\nMy crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.\n\nOverall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues."
"1","Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap, and definitely very poor quality. Grease is the common theme in food, and though it might taste OK a first, your digestive tract may say otherwise later. \n\nThe space was cramped, we sat almost elbow to elbow with other guests, with my back a foot from a brick wall. The waitresses were extremely fast, except for coffee refills. Almost felt rushed because the bill came so quick; probably had something to do with the busy line in the waiting room. And why, in this day and age, are you cash-only, Pamela?"
"2","Ok! The best hash I have ever had. Their potatoes are \""bananas!\"""
"2","I have always enjoyed going here for breakfast/brunch. In my younger years, I would go for the hotcakes. So thin, large, and crispy on the edges. Yummmyyy.\n\nI will write an update to this review...after I go to it again hopefully  next month...But if it is as good as I remember, you won't be sorry going here."
"1","The food here is over the top excessively greasy. So greasy that it made me sick to my stomach before I was done eating my meal. My husband and I split the chocolate chip pancakes and a ham and cheese omelette with potatoes and toast on the side. Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again."
"2","Not the place for local, organic, grass-fed, gourmet riff-raff. Pamela's is known for stick-to-your-ribs diner food and they do it very well. Definitely my go-to for weekend brunch or hangover recovery in Pittsburgh. The Oakland location you'll find is often full of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon students, whereas the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside locations usually have a more yuppie-type clientele.\n\nPamela's hotcakes are a masterpiece. Never mind that they use pounds and pounds of butter for these hotcakes, you'll be hard-pressed to find pancakes/crepes as delicious as these. What's great is that they can be eaten alone in a savory manner, or piled with fruit and whipped cream and more butter for a sweeter breakfast experience. The lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at. You can ask them to griddle the potatoes a little longer for a crispier taste, which I definitely recommend. \n\nThe omelets are all pretty standard fare here, but they do them consistently well every time I've been. Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome. Only downside is that it's cash only, but since there are a couple ATM's and a PNC nearby, it can be overlooked. \n\nOverall, come here for some of the best breakfast comfort food that Pittsburgh has to offer."
"2","Today was my second time at a Pamela's. During my first trip I made the mistake of 1)not ordering hot cakes 2) dining alone 3)not ordering hotcakes! \n\nI was worried about a wait for a Sunday morning but it was surprisingly only 15minutes. We were seated & greeted promptly. Both of us ordered the morning after breakfast with the strawberry pancakes. The potatoes /home fries were awesome & as another reviewer mentioned it feels as if every bite is different (&fabulous). \n\nSpeaking of fabulous, I'm thankful to have finally experienced the Pamelas hotcake. It was filled with fresh strawberries, sour cream, brown sugar bits.. & every bite was better than the last. Don't let that trio scare or fool you-.it's delicious \n\nNext weekend can't come fast enough to stop back\n\n...forgot to mention it took no time at all for 4 giant plates of food to reach our table."
"1","We heard that this place had amazing pancakes and was always extremely busy. We took our chances and arrived around 9:45am. It was open seating and we were easily able to find a table.\n\nFirst off - you can only pay cash. That is a huge turn off, especially if you are out of town. Personally, I never carry cash and frankly I don't know many people who do. This place isn't worth going to an ATM for.\n\nSeveral people at my table ordered the pancakes so I got french toast. It was incredible eggy. If you like that, then you will like these but I don't prefer to have a layer of egg on my french toast. I tried a friends hot cakes and they were okay. They are super thin and crispy on the outside. I prefer a thick fluffy pancake. :(\n\nI also didn't love the service we received. The server came over with several plates and was extremely rude about us not speaking up enough about whose food was what even though we were telling her it was ours. I wanted a refill on my orange juice but the next time our waitress came around she gave us the bill - thanks!"
"2","I had a wonderful breakfast at Pamela's. The food really is delicious, but quite expensive for breakfast! Our bill came to about $40 for 3 people. That's a lot of money for eggs and pancakes!!\n\nWe were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived because the waiting area was packed. They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!\n\nEveryone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be \""crispy\"" and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.\n\nI ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.\n\nThe food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem. Prepare to pay more than your typical diner, but you certainly won't be disappointed by the quality!"
"1","There are 2 types of \""Good\"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck."
"2","Maybe \""yinzer good\"" isn't always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a 25-30 minutes wait time. It took 50 minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasn't mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months."
"1","Pamela's is the hottest thing in Pittsburgh, and they have lines of an hour long, going out the door, they don't take reservations, But I'm not sure why they have such high ratings. After waiting for an hour to get seated, we were expecting good food, and in reality, everything was drenched in butter. Everything was super greasy, buttery. Even their hotcakes (which are like crepes - love crepes) they look great, but once you taste them, it's all butter. Our party also tried the French toast and hash browns and those were super greasy too and didn't taste good at all. The reason it's so busy is because it's the only show in town. There are a few of them and there's really nowhere else to go. It's sad. Being from NJ and having many diners that compete with each other, there are some good tasting Diners making good French toast, crepes and hash browns. This was just a joke and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. The service on the other hand, was very good and workers were very nice and helpful."
"2","Recommend by several senior student of mine in CMU, finally I came here today for my dear friends birthday. Food in here really amazing and served very fast. Associates in Pamela's also very kind and sweet. But they only receive cash no credit card such a pity.  Love this dinning experience and will come back very soon :D"
"2","We liked everything except the bacon. Another waiter recommended the ham for next time. If you like potatoes be sure to ask for extra crispy. The crepes were great come in a stack of three. I'd suggest getting one or two only. The fresh strawberry were great even though out of season. Definitely will eat here again."
"2","Fantastic crepes. Really. The savory ones (like the smoked salmon), the sweet ones, all of them are just plain great. The restaurant is actually a tiny basement of a Shadyside-style home. They try hard to make it feel like France by making it narrow, crowded, lacking air conditioning, and cash-only. Those are the drawbacks, but it adds to the authenticity I suppose. Also, they have Evian and Orangina, which is always nice. If you need breakfast - can't beat the crepes here. Go, eat, have fun, forget where you are for a while."
"1","Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the \""unspoken house rules\"": \n\n1. Order first (do not try and sit down).\n2. Wait for your food while standing.\n3. Find a seat (if one is available).\n\nUnder no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.\n\nMy wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.\n\nLittle did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: \""you can either sit there or there\"", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the \""unwritten rules\"" to us.  An \""excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down\"" would have sufficed.\n\nSo, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money."
"2","I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance."
"2","I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often, and the owner who cooks the crepes recognizes my wife and me every single time we're there.\n\nThe crepes are excellent, the prices are more than reasonable, and as long as you don't go there during a peak period, it's never too crowded."
"1","The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding, toe-curling, orgasm.  I say, \""might be\"" because on my recent (and last) trip there I didn't have an opportunity to sample them.  In fact, I didn't eat anything at all.\n\nPlease let me explain.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of Walnut Street.  Customers are expected to wait in a line that stretches from the entrance, through the main dining area, to a counter where the crepes are ordered and cooked.  It's a horrendous setup for multiple reasons.  \n\nFirst, there aren't many tables.  When I went there on a Saturday morning, there were at least 20 people standing in line for the ten or so small tables.  Second, the restaurant expects you to wait in line, standing next to tables of patrons who are eating their food, until a table becomes free.  At that point, the woman at the counter takes the next order, a man begins preparing the crepes, and the front of the line is seated while everyone else continues to wait.  Those who have waited long enough, are finally able to sit, while hungry and impatient diners-to-be stand next to their table and wait some more.\n\nIt's a horrible atmosphere, and not one conducive to a pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe dining space is poorly designed, so that the line of waiting patrons snakes directly though the middle of the cramped dining area.  Which means that when you are waiting, you are continually bumped by servers shuttling food to the tables and dirty dishes back to the kitchen.  When you are eating, you are likely to: 1) have a bunch of hungry people staring at you eat, waiting for you to leave your table, so that they may be seated; and/or 2) have a standing person's ass within a few inches of your head.  What a great dining atmosphere!\n\nWhat's all the more annoying is the lackadaisical work ethic of the people who prepare the crepes.  More than once during my wait, the man making the crepes just stood around, not making any food, waiting for another table to open, so a party's order could be taken, and he could then prepare the next order.  \n\nAfter waiting 15-20 minutes while hungry, becoming increasingly annoyed at being bumped at least 2 dozen times by serves traversing the line, and then seeing the owner stop making food until another order was taken, I said to myself, \""enough of this nonsense\"".\n\nMy party and I left to go to another restaurant.  I've not eaten any crepe in the world that would justify a long wait under such annoying circumstances, and I will not be back."
"2","There are two locations, one just off Walnut Street in Shadyside and one on Craig Street in north Oakland.  The hours are quite limited, but I like the French neighborhood cafe vibe. \nThe crepes and coffee are really good, and they have a great selection of French tea.  The place is quite hectic, however.  As everyone said, wait in line to order, then get a table.  I have been in both locations many times, and it has never been a problem, though it does seem a bit weird at first. \n As for the service, it seems that their attitude is to give any rudeness you give them right back.  Be polite, and they will treat you accordingly."
"1","The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. \n\nHowever, the crepes are extremely over price. So over price that I cannot afford a drink.\n\nFinally, the staff is extremely rude and LOVES to make loud examples of people not familiar with their system. I've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff."
"2","Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche, ham and cheese with their soytang sauce and plain butter with sugar.  \n\nThe place gets a bit crowded around noon and they have a pretty strict policy about ordering before you choose a seat.  Also, they only take cash (crepes run $7-9 plus $2 drinks).\n\nThey may have some mildly unpleasant/unpopular 'rules' but I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here and plan on returning."
"1","French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said, I found the crepes to be overly thick and the filling, while tasty, too skimpy and thus overpowered by the crepes wrap. But it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment. I was in Pittsburgh visiting a relative with terminal cancer at the nearby hospital ; she had requested a breakfast crepes so I found Cafe Parisiennes through Yelp. We were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours. The sign said the Cafe opened at 10:00AM, which was when we arrived. We could see staff inside and asked if we could come in. The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready \""in ten minutes\"" or so. After another ten minutes, we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order, I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange. This is not the kind of attitude for anyone in a service business and I would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone."
"1","Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \""help wanted\"" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe."
"2","We went here on Saturday morning.  To explain our devotion to this place, I should say that we drove down from Butler in order to get our crepes fix before our friend's early afternoon wedding.  You see, we used to go here every Friday after our first (and last) class of the day in college.  It was/is a mild obsession- a love affair of sorts.\n\nWhen we got here just before 10:00, we saw that it wasn't open yet.  It was slightly odd that we stood outside until 10:15 before they opened the door.  I think that instead of making customers wait, they should just open the restaurant later, but whatever.\n\nWe walked downstairs and got in line at the register.  I was so happy to see that nothing had changed- I ordered the mixed veggie crepe with soytang sauce, and a nonfat cafe au lait.  They only accept cash, so come prepared.  I paid, took our number, and sat down.  The space is really small, so it does fill up, but it's perfectly cozy.  Our crepes were as good as ever, and including my coffee drink, my bill came in at just over $10.00.\n\nThe owner is very friendly, and normally behind the crepe maker.  This is a great place to have brunch or dessert- they also have sweet crepes (Nutella and banana is my favorite)- so be sure to check it out. It's right off of Walnut Street, so you can easily stop in before or after an afternoon of shopping."
"1","Well, to start, crepes aren't a Parisian concept.  They are solely a Brittany thing!  Therefore, the fact that this chain of restaurants carries a name like Crepes Parisiennes is pretentious.  That aside, the crepes are okay, nothing special.  I've had much lighter (crepes here were a bit heavier than they should be) and more authentic crepes elsewhere.  The other thing I do not like about this place are their hours. They are closed by 4pm and on Mondays, and stop serving savory crepes at 3pm???"
"2","I love it here. It's so cute inside and so French. I honestly don't know how \""French\"" it actually is because I've never been to France, but from what I imagine France to be like, it's French. \n\nThe crepes, sweet or savory are delicious!! I think I prefer the sweet ones. Anything with nutella is so good. It's a good place to go for brunch with a friend. I can't wait to go when I get home again.\n\nThe wait staff is really friendly and you can watch them make crepes too! It's cool how they do it. I give props because I tried making crepes before.. and it's really hard to get it nice and thin.\n\nI like how the seating works too because you order and then sit down.. but sometimes there's not enough seats so that's an issue, but the staff knows that and won't make your food until you have somewhere to sit so it's not like you're standing around with food and nowhere to sit."
"1","Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!"
"2","You come here for the first time, you may think you're walking into some mystery basement.  You come here with a friend who's also never been here, they may think you're taking them somewhere scary.  Thankfully, neither of those are true!  \n\nAs soon you walk in the door, you're comforted by the fact that it's just a cozy little basement restaurant!  Coming here at 2pm on a weekday, you'll also be joining the ladies who lunch, just fyi, this is Shadyside after all!  I actually got the idea to come later (after the lunch rush) because of the Yelp reviews.  Good thing I did because the ladies who lunch had taken every table except for one!\n\nLooking at the menu, the first thing that struck me was that this wasn't a lunch place!  Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  \n\nNow I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  \n\nHot Tip:  Cash only!  Come on off peak times because it's tiny and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat during lunch hours or Saturday/Sunday brunch."
"2","Truly one of my favorite breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  The crepes are always cooked to perfection and the coffee is absolutely amazing.  Inconveniences include being cash only and being very, very tiny so getting a table might require some patience on a busy weekend morning...\n\n...but it is totally worth the wait.  The sweet crepes are my favorite, but I'm just a sucker for anything that involves fruit and nutella."
"1","The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise, negative stars would  be in effect. WHO on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to? What a completely miserable experience. The bitchy emo service obviously leaves something to be desired, then again so does the ENTIRE restaurant! Sure, melted cheese in a crepe is good. Know what else is good? ANY melted cheese from any breakfast place and Not having to endure this hell hole. I am just upset that I went there in the early part of my day and am now in a foul mood as a result. I have been in Pittsburgh a few weeks and this place is without rival the worst brunch I've ever had (PA or CA) So, the one positive thing about it IS.... it has made me appreciate every other sub par brunch I've had up until this point.  Absolutely will never return. EVEN THE Orange juice was bad. Are you kidding?"
"2","I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The quality and consistency is excellent. The owner is the head chef, And will come to recognize you if you are a repeat customer. The ordering and seating routine is a little unusual. You stand in line and place an order and then get a number. Only then are you supposed to sit at a table. This does make sense since people cannot just sit at a table when there's a long line of people waiting to order. Just an FYI. The crapes are simple, but always good. I usually get the tomato and cheese and add an egg. The coffee is okay. I only wish they opened a little bit earlier."
"2","Like the waiter and waitress there"
"2","Wait, how have I not reviewed Crepes Parisiennes?\n\nI first fell in love with crepes in my early teenage years, when a crepe shop opened up in my hometown of State College. Yes, the town that is best known for its love of football and binge drinking once had a restaurant that sold crepes that were practically transcendent, stuffed with anything you could imagine. Not surprisingly, it didn't last long, and my heart broke when it closed and I could only get my crepe fix on my yearly family vacations to Disney World.\n\nIn my sophomore year of college, I studied abroad in Italy, and rediscovered my crepe obsession when I found them in a British-style pub. A trip to Paris for four days had me eating the simple street version each day for breakfast. And then I returned to State College, crepeless and sad. How excited was I when I moved to Pittsburgh and found Crepes Parisiennes? I don't even think I need to answer that question.\n\nThese are GOOD crepes. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The topping list is unfortunately very limited. They don't have many veggies, they only have one type of cheese, and they don't have bacon for your breakfast crepe or strawberries for your dessert crepe. Still, you can't really go wrong with any of the combinations.\n\nI came back to State College and tried the new crepe shop in town, and it sucked. It made me realize that I totally take Crepes Parisiennes for granted. The food might be simple, but trust me when I say Pittsburgh is lucky to have it!"
"2","I have been shopping at EB Pepper since it was in the Ross Park Mall (Well over 15 years ago!!) I have travelled to many cities, both in the US and abroad,  and I can honestly say that hands down this is my favorite boutique--no sloppy looks here, feminine, well-made, CHIC and gorgeous clothing--i even tried to shop here pregnant--If you need a cocktail dress or a rehearsal dinner dress OR an amazing suit..i just wish they would have a website...\nLove this place, always will!"
"1","Who deleted my review of Sunnyledge?\n\nBack in April, I met a girl for drinks at the Sunnyledge.  We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu.  When we arrived there, however it was a different story.  We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.\n\nWe shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.\n\nThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  \n\nEven when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.\n\nTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.\n\nI hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.  I have the means, I have the will."
"2","So I always heard good things about Sunnyledge but never stopped in until I went there my junior year at CMU. Biggest mistake of my first 2 years. And yes, I had a fake ID so I could get into most places. \n\nWell, Sunnyledge is kind of a bed and breakfast type lodging but on Fridays from 6-8, they have their happy hour. 1/2 price Martinis. These martinis are unbelievable. They are pretty strong and taste delicious. They have so many different martini's on their menu so just choosing one/two/three/four will take a bit of time to decide each time you re-order.\n\nSo the martini comes in a regular martini glass. Well, you also get the leftover martini mix poured into a small glass container. They put dry ice in your glass before they pour your drink so the drink actually starts to bubble and puff up whisps of smoke which is so cool. There is also a larger piece of dry ice in your glass container which keeps your extra martini cool until you're ready to drink it. \n\nOnce your finished the first glass, you pour what's in the container into your martini glass and voila, it comes out to a second martini. Granted that these martini's are kind of expensive, on half price happy hour, you are pretty much getting 2 martini's for the price of one.\n\nThey also have a free tiny buffet appetizer where they have different things each time. I've had cheese and crackers, bruschetta, cole cuts crackers and cheese, etc..\n\nThe menu isn't too bad either. I had their duck wrap and sliders one time. The fries were different. Not bad. but not exceptional. The only issue I have with the food is that the servings are really small and aren't worth the money you spend on it but if you go there on an empty stomach and end up ordering 4 martini's (8 total drinks) then you will need to get something to eat."
"1","*For the bar\n\nWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.\n\nJust getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.\n\nI browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. \n\nIt was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.\n\nI found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost? A cool $9.\n\nIt appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink."
"1","I usually enjoy shopping at the Gap, but I recently had a really bad experience.  I went in to exchange a shirt and when I asked the orange face goblin manager if they had any more he was incredibly rude.  First, he wouldn't even look at me when I asked him a if there were any more of the shirt I wanted to exchange, and him immediately told me they did not have any of these.  Since I was in a hurry I just decided to return the shirt, then on my way out of the store I saw a whole table display of the shirt in several different colors.  The costumer service really ruined my experience."
"2","The guy who works here gave me the best customer service and helped me pick out my new favorite jeans. Probably the best experience I have ever had at the Gap."
"1","After a personal call and lengthy discussion on me wanting something unique and different and not a standard vase of flowers in our school colors of white and blue, I was asked if a unique container would be ok and I said that is what I wanted unique and different, from cheerleaders to the other cheer coach, for $100. When I saw that it was a vase of a few blue and white flowers, I was furious and feel ripped off!!! The order my family placed online was so awesome!! A puppy made of flowers in a ceramic pumpkin candy dish!! It was not even $60 including se day shipping!! The photos on his website have several larger arrangements made for $65-85!!! I sent several emails with photos comparing the two and have not received a reply back!! I will be calling!\nBUYERS BEWARE!!!! I guess he thought I would not see then!!"
"1","Used him a long time ago and to this day I still feel ripped off. Swore up and down to me he could do a job and came up short. very short. Then had the nerve to blame me.\n\nNow he has the nerve to stay open.\nHate this place!"
"1","Went here after dinner to grab a frosty but gave up after an extended wait. The cashiers were busy chatting with their friends and couldn't be bothered to help anyone in line. The location also seemed a bit sketchy; I'd avoid this one. Try Panera Bread across the street."
"1","I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:\n\nWelcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?\n\nYeah, I'd like a Frescuit. \n\nWe ain't got no hashbrowns!\n\n...um, all I want it a Frescuit. \n\nA'ight... I'm just lettin' you know."
"2","In a pinch, Wendy's can do.  However, if you're in a hurry, and expect to use the drive-thru and get out, go elsewhere.  That is also a good sign, shows that the place has staying power with the constant line of people inside and outside wanting their food.  Bad thing, traffic can sometimes be snarled if there is that big of a line that it comes out onto Baum Blvd.\n\nQuick sidenote: if you decide to use the drive-thru, be sure to have used the bathroom prior, not fun to sit there waiting when you really need to use the facilities.  It's like that long ride on the turnpike when you already passed the last rest stop for 50 miles."
"1","Just like every other Wendy's you've been to, except with slower service! Employees show no sense of urgency. There are two cash registers inside but I've never seen more than one being used at once, no matter how long the line is. Last time I was here, it took 30 minutes from the time I took my place in line until I received my order."
"1","what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?"
"1","Don't use the drive-thru. I'm not sure why I keep coming here (probably because the food is decent enough and cheap). Every time I'm here, without fail, I can expect to wait no less than 13 minutes in the drive-thru."
"1","I visisted this Wendy's often when I first started working nearby in Shadyside. But I quickly learned my lesson. I got tired of spending 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line. No less than 20 minutes. Every. Single. Time. The drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins. Plus, the staff is rude. I've driven out of my way a few times to the Wendy's in Wilkinsburg just to avoid this place.\n\nAnyway, I have no qualms with the food, as it's the same as any other Wendy's. So it's fine if you have time to kill."
"1","Fast food.... NOT.\n\nBig corporate America places only get one shot w us. We came here cause we got stuff to do, quick trip to TARGET, try to get child fed quickly and to bed on time. SO LETS STOP AT Wendy's, right? Quick?\n\nSwing and miss. Never again."
"2","Even as a vegetarian, I felt REALLY silly ordering \""orange wheat gluten\"" or \""sesame soy protein\"". But their vegetarian menu is fantastic! I'm happy ordering veggies and tofu and Asian restaurants. But I really miss sesame chicken, and I can get it at China Palace! \n\nThe food itself is every so slightly above par. It's a little sweet, but not too oily. I can't vouch for their meat dishes, as the person I went with is also veg. They really manage to create satisfying, typical Chinese dishes, with meat substitutes that would fool most meat eaters.\n\nIt's definately expensive, we paid $40 for three entrees and a salad. And there's other Chinese food that's just as good for less money. But for vegetarians who miss \""typical\"" dishes, China Place is so the place to go!"
"2","Yumm-eeee!  I don't care if the previous reviewer thinks that this place is Americanized Chinese food--I love it!    As I've said on other reviews, I like my food kind of plain, so I love the Sesame Chicken or the Chicken Broccoli.  I figure that if a place can get the basics right, then they can do the more complicated dishes.  My husband Rick likes his food a little spicier.  His favorite is the Kung Pao Shrimp.  Once when I was feeling bold, Rick and I split an order of Crispy Whole Fish with Homemade Spicy Hunan Sauce.  Spicy?  I think I saw through time after trying it!\n\nOne dish I'm going to try someday is Three's Company.  No, it does not feature Joyce DeWitt, John Ritter, or Suzanne Summers.  It is  Lemon Chicken, General Tso's Chicken and Chicken with Vegetables.  For the vegetarian-inclined, they have Soy Protein with Cashew Nuts, Soy Protein with Curry Sauce, and Wheat Gluten with Garlic Sauce.  Uh, no thanks!  I'll stick to my chicken dishes!  \n\nChina Palace features a full bar, but since I'm a diabetic, I usually stick to my tea.  Plus my drink of choice (Bailey's with Coffee) probably would not go well with Chinese food!  On the whole, China Palace is a place for wonderful Chinese food and definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.\n\nNow should I try one of their other specialties, Three Afire?"
"1","This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt, and I've gotta say, guys, I wasn't impressed.  This was also the first time in my life I've ordered from a Chinese restaurant where the lady taking the orders and the delivery guy were white.  Odd.  I suppose, then, I shouldn't have been surprised by the food.  My Moo Shu Chicken was mostly cabbage.  The pork dumplings were all dough, and the dough was very thick and unappealing.  To end on a good note, though, the hot and sour soup was both hot and sour, which you don't always find."
"2","China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes.  A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken, but there are also more authentic dishes such as Szechuan Water Boiled Beef (shui zhu nio) and Yu xiang Eggplant.  Personally I have to say the Water Boiled Beef is both the best Water Boiled Beef I've had in Pittsburgh and also the best dish I've had at China Palace, I like all my spicy dishes with extra spicy.  Their Americanized offerings are also cooked pretty well, definitely better than take out restaurants.\n\nContrary to popular belief, China Palace actually has a Taiwanese owner and not an American owner.\n\nChina Palace is nice as you can go there with people with more Americanized palates if you have a more Asian palate, or vice versa, and you can please everyone.\n\nPrices run from around 9 dollars to upper teens for some of the chef's specials.\n\nHighly Recommended."
"1","The food here was greasy, uninspired and bland. The mockmeat \""chicken\"" was too chewy and the dish felt oily and heavy. It was something I grew tired of in a matter of five or six bites.\n\nI was also disappointed that they don't serve brown rice.\n\nThe service was friendly enough, though. \n\nNot to be recommended unless you're desperate."
"1","Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes, but the food did not arrive until after 7:00.  I had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot.  The duck itself was not that great; the skin (usually the best part of the duck) was soggy instead of crispy and the meat lacked flavor.  If anyone knows a place in Pittsburgh that serves good Peking duck, please message me."
"1","People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).\n\nCame here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's, but the line was too long so we walked a few doors down to China Palace. I was REALLY wary because I did a quick Yelp search before we walked in, but my dad insisted that it was probably \""not that bad\"".\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n- Cheese wontons (Um... they literally just fried american cheese in the wontons. Who does that?! It's supposed to be CREAM CHEESE!! And they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in.)\n- Chicken Lo Mein\n- Beef Lo Mein\n- Shrimp and Broccoli w/ Sweet and Sour Soup (The soup was the most disgusting texture of I-don't-know-what. Needless to say, that was left untouched.)\n\nLet's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing... A complete travesty to Chinese cuisine. It was bland, yet greasy and MSG-ridden (if that makes any sense). Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \""authentic\"" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about). And the kicker? It came out to about $32 + tip for food that we DIDN'T even finish half of. We literally just got up mid-meal when we overheard the table behind us complaining about how they found a dead fruit fly in their bowl of rice.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!!! ... unless you're a snake that is."
"1","We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there."
"2","The portions are huge. Reasonable price. The fish I ordered was decent."
"1","General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... \n\nI am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever!"
"2","This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Great location, great veggie options. Every meal I have eaten there has been tasty.  Only 2 things that bother me, the hot and sour soup is TOO hot. I can't eat it. And it's not easy to find a parking space. Lots of driving around to find a spot. \nBut the restaurant is definitely worth checking out."
"1","This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy, not very appetizing or tasty).  Entrees like chicken with any kind of veggies/mushrooms are okay.  Price is not bad.  Why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh?"
"1","Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor, with a waitress who did not ask specifics and was slow to deliver things like hot mustard and kept us waiting for our order for over an hour.  Not all her fault.  And, the food was ordinary.  Not bad, a little tasteless, but why bother?"
"1","What has happened to this place? Used to be delicious, but something's changed! Rude host...pointed us to a table (of course the personal cell phone BS going on with a friend was far more important) for a noon lunch, in a nearly empty restaurant. Nor good signs and we should have walked out then. We started with a bland egg roll. Moved on to fair won ton soup. Entrees of cashew chicken and Kung Pao chicken, both on brown rice we're disappointing. Left us both wishing that we had gone for Thai food down the street instead! Save yourself and opt for one of the other fabulous dining experiences in Shadyside!"
"1","The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better."
"1","In sum, we ordered take out here a few days ago. There were bugs in my egg drop soup. Nuff said.\n\n\nUsually, I write these long reviews. Not today. I ordered two orders of soup Hot and Sour and Egg Drop. I only eat the Hot and Sour the night we ordered our take out. I specifically ordered the Egg Drop to have for lunch yesterday. Fortunately for me- I noticed the bugs prior to eating. Looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup. Disgusting."
"2","My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the \""city that sleeps\""). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area."
"1","Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery, and the wontons were inedible. I ordered pepper steak wwhich they substituted pork sparerib meat and I surmised that they didn't think I would notice. Also I think the health dept needs to perhaps male a visit;the place is dirty."
"1","Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal."
"1","I have never, ever thrown food away, but I couldn't stomach this stuff. I got the pork fried rice and egg drop soup. Holy moly was that a poor decision. The rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy \""pork\"". It tasted nothing like pork, or meat for that matter. I tried adding soy sauce for some kind of flavor but dear lord that didn't help. The soup was a weird creamy mess. My friend got the general tso chicken, which should generally be a safe choice. WRONG. cardboard. Cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster. Seriously we've never been so grossed out that we had to throw out $20 worth of food but that's what happened."
"1","Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service"
"1","Had a craving for Chinese the other day while I was in Shadyside and wandered into China Palace.  How this place can stay in business in an area that I consider to be more sophisticated is a real mystery.  It was just awful and the service was terrible.\n\nI wanted to have the assorted appetizer platter, but asked if I could substitute one of the items with dumplings.  Our waiter had to ask the manager.  After much whispering, the manager came back to me and told me that I could have dumplings...then I asked if I could get the fried dumplings with that instead of steamed.   Well I was met with an outraged \""NO\""!!!!  It kind of surprised me that I got this kind of reaction.  I was told that the chef would have to fry 2 dumplings just for my platter.  I looked around and there were only 2 other people in the entire restaurant.  Isn't that what they're supposed to do?  Cook food for people to eat?  I would have never asked if I thought it would be such a big deal.  \n\nAnyway, the food was not very good.  In fact, it was awful.  \n\nWere they having an off day?   I'm not sure they were.   There's never any reason to be rude to your patrons.  No need to ever return."
"1","Not really for females under 45."
"1","This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop, the blond sales associate judged my friend and I by staring at us and abruptly walking away without a greeting. My friend was given dirty looks form the elderly sales associate while I tried to ignore the rudeness and enjoy the clothing. I am not complaining about the prices, I have bought many items from the same designers and enjoy the designers quality, I was not sticker shocked. What I am upset about is the customer service by these women who think it is okay to treat potential customers with such disrespect. Neither me friend nor I were dressed poorly, we are both fashion stylist in the Pittsburgh area. I have never been so disrespected in my life and after writing this review I will be contacting the owner."
"1","So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?"
"2","Eddy was recommended to me by a friend since I have curly hair. Pretty much my entire life I'd never done anything with my hair except trim it (cut-wise, I dyed it for a long time), but I decided it was time for a change. I decided to go with a dramatic look and I was very nervous (not sure how well I hid it) but Eddy was super nice and I calmed down quickly after we started chatting. And WOW, he did an absolutely fantastic job! He cut it perfectly to enhance my curls and did everything exactly as I asked (I've had trouble before with stylists ignoring my instructions about cutting my bangs or being too timid about cutting off damage). This is, without a doubt, the best haircut I've ever had. (Though that may change since I'm planning to go back to him later to try more styles!) I wanted a cut that was both feminine and fierce and he nailed it.  \n\nI highly recommend Eddy for anyone with curly hair! I also greatly appreciated the student discount."
"2","Best Salon in Pittsburgh! I've been going to Eddy for a few years now and he never fails to make my hair look a thousand times better than it does when walking in the door. I have super thick, curly hair and he makes cutting and styling it look effortless. Super talented stylist who is always great fun to talk to! \n\nEveryone at Salon Cercone are really nice, and the environment is welcoming and casual. It's definitely a great place for the more laid back salon goers."
"2","I've been going to Eddy for years. In fact I am his first paying client. I have followed him from different salons and was so happy when he landed at Salon Cercone. I believe he's been there 8 years or so now. It's a perfect fit for him as a stylist and me as a client.\nEddy is a true artist in his craft. I have had every colour, cut and style and then some. Anything Eddy or I could think up over the years, I've worn it. Over twenty years later and I still get compliments from complete strangers on my look. I owe it all to Eddy!\nThe atmosphere is upscale but not stuffy. The staff are a knowledgeable group of extremely talented hair, skin and nail artists. There are many salons to choose from but not many that offer excellence. Salon Cercone is a true Shadyside gem."
"1","The owner stole a bracelet brought in for repairs and has lied over and over about returning it."
"1","2 woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable. I haven't received my piece yet and its been about 5 days. Iffy about who owns the place but, ill see what the end product will be once I was receive it. If it approves I will change my rating"
"1","I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price."
"2","I've had pretty good experiences dining here, but maybe that's because other people were paying for my food about half of those times.  The service was fine, and I liked the decor.  I also enjoyed the food, although if I recall correctly, there was entirely too much of it.\n\nAs a carless resident of Pittsburgh, I love the great location on Walnut Street.  I don't have to go out of my way to dine here, since there are plenty of stores to visit."
"1","Food, blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy, and they were drowning in greasy, room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.\n\nService, argh.  It was late, but if you're open you're open, right?  Slow, inattentive, wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet."
"2","We had Sunday brunch upstairs and I was very pleased with the quality and quantity of the dishes and the service. Lots better than most."
"1","Too pricey for the quality."
"2","Just got back from a lunch at the Walnut Grill. I had been there once before about 3 years ago. I don't remember much other than it was a solid meal and the mushroom soup I got was good.\n\nAnyway, it was fairly empty for lunch. Perhaps it's because it has a darker atmosphere (today was gorgeous out) than other SS places. I had the lunch special which was a Cajun chicken sandwich with mozzarella, basil and roasted red peppers (9$). GF got the veggie sandwich which has portabellos, spinach, feta and onions (9$).\n\nMy sandwich was great. The chicken was nicely cooked (not dry). The mozzarella was nice and big. The basil was a nice touch and fresh. The roasted red peppers were from a can, but were good. Served on warm ciabatta. Sandwich wasn't overly salty either. The fries were surprisingly good.\n\nGF's veggie sandwich was equally good. I usually don't like spinach, but the bite I had was nice and feta/mushroom-y. She ate all of it (which rarely happens).\n\nI also got a Proper draft which is an English Pale Ale. It was quite good. Nice and malty with minimal hops."
"1","While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu, don't be fooled. We ordered the calamari, mexican pizza, ahi tuna, and french onion soup. While the onion soup was actually good, the rest was awful.\n\nThe mexican pizza was greasy, and looks like it was reheated in a microwave, it tasted like cardboard, and looked even worse. The calamari was awful, came with a gross looking/tasting dip. The ahi tuna was actually just mediocre, which was a nice improvement from the rest of the meal. \n\nIf i was a bigger jerk I would have demanded they take the food back, but I just had a bite of everything and asked the waitress to take it back.\n\nI would never eat here again"
"1","my husband and I went there for dinner this evening and while their bunches are usually lovely I don't think we will return for a dinner meal again.\n\nI ordered the steak mid-rare and asked for a Caesar salad for my side... the salad was terrible, bland, the dressing was barely there and i really question if it was actually a caesar dressing. The parmesan cheese tasted old and well, sorta like it had been shaved off the block of cheese ages ago - it was sort of rubbery and bland as well. My steak was more medium than mid-rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish... the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it. The broccoli served on the side was barely steamed and seasoned with some surprising and awful seasoning. Completely disappointing.  \n\nMy husband's salad looked much more appetizing... baby field greens and ranch dressing - he was happy. He asked for a shrimp alfredo which they did make special for him (they have it as chicken alfredo on the menu). I tasted the sauce and it was ok but very thin and could have used more cheese to add more flavor as well as thicken it. He was happy with the meal but admitted to me that Girasole's alfredo was much much better. \n\nSo no, I don't see us heading back anytime soon for anything other than perhaps a bunch meal. I will say that the service was excellent - the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and they did a great job but the food is overpriced for the quality of preparation."
"2","Want good bloody mary's to kick off your Saturday or Sunday morning? Come to Walnut Grill. They throw a jumbo shrimp in it which is awesome. The eggs benedict is terrific!"
"1","This place has cockroaches.\nPeople throw up in the booths.\nPretty good white russian.\n\n(b)"
"1","Not too shabby.  I would call it a \""finer diner\"" in terms of the definition of a Diner.  The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees we have all had before.\nThe food is good though; however you're paying for the location and decor (which, in our opinion, was kind of out-dated).  We started with the mushroom flatbread that was a bit on the sweet side; however it was loaded with mushrooms which is a huge plus.\nI had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and Jordan had the reuben.  The salmon was very light and tasty and Jordan's corned beef was sliced real thick.  French fries are pretty standard.\nAll in all, I guess this is where the rich people of ShadySide get their diner food: same kind of food, just a fancier ambiance than Denny's.  \nWe will be back when we want something comforting but dont want to be surrounded by teenagers and want something better than Eat 'N Park."
"2","The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4\"" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended), a Microplane grater or splurging on a new Shun knife, Williams-Sonoma always seems to have what I want with people there who know what they're talking about."
"1","Generally speaking, I am a huge fan of Williams-Sonoma. In CA, I love their store in Union Square. The service in this store is ridiculous. The ladies seemed to be complaining about something the whole time we were there and seemed to have an attitude as if we were intruding into their space.\nThe real kicker for me, though, was that they advertise for free gift wrapping but don't seem to really offer it. The first time I came in, my boyfriend spent around $50 on a gift for a friend. We were excited about the gift wrapping but then they said they don't offer gift wrapping after 5 pm. Seriously? Why not? They weren't busy or anything at that moment. Why couldn't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us?\nThe second time (and the last time) I came in they just said \""no, we don't wrap\"". I was so confused and annoyed that I just left after paying. I haven't written a review in over a year but their horrible service motivated me to say something.\nBeware of these ladies. They just aren't nice."
"2","Great store!\n\nOne of the previous reviewers seems to have had some bad experiences with service in the store; my experience thankfully hasn't been the same. I've always had helpful, friendly people working whenever I've popped in to get something for our kitchen.\n\nGreat selection of items, and the staff always have great recommendations for me when I'm not quite sure of what I need. Their sales could be a bit better, but that's not necessarily the store's fault, and it's never really worth the longer trip to the South Side to hit their main competitor's store.\n\nParking can be a bit annoying if you try to get a spot on the street, but the garage around the corner is convenient and is reasonably priced. Gotta love Walnut Street!"
"2","My hubby and I wandered around Shadyside on Saturday afternoon and made Williams-Sonoma one of our stops. It was warm (but not too warm) and sunny (but not too bright), and Williams-Sonoma's doors were thrown open, welcoming customers into a land of expensive kitchen gadgets and extravagant kitchen accessories. The scent of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies wafted from a high-end easy-bake-oven type device set up near the entrance. Needless to say, the store was packed. This really is the perfect Williams-Sonoma location.\n\nMy complaint with Williams-Sonoma lies not with this store but with the entire company. The hubby and I have an adequate amount of discretionary income, yet browsing here makes me feel like I live below the poverty line. I just really prefer shopping at Williams-Sonoma's competitors of Crate & Barrel and Sur La Table that have a better balance of low, moderate, and high priced items."
"1","BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted. Do not believe that the \""We Are Responsible\"" sign out in front means anything. The brushes are very rough on the vehicle. If you have a dark colored vehicle i would not use this car wash, go to a touchless."
"1","Remember that saying, that sex is like pizza - even when it's so-so, it's good? That pretty much sums it up. There's nothing appallingly wrong with the Pizza Co. pizza. It's just kind of ho-hum. \n\nWith that said, I enjoyed the chili poppers a lot. (Which were inexplicably wrapped with the ranch sauce for delivery. Mmmmm....hot, sweaty ranch dressing.)\n\nThe delivery guy was really friendly. Delivery time was unimpressive. A full 45 minutes mid-afternoon, and I live two blocks away? That's what I get for being lazy, probably. Karmic pizza. \n\nPrices are pretty good though, so that's a bonus. They may end up being my 'Dangit, I've only got fifteen bucks!' joint. Otherwise, probably not."
"2","I wasn't crazy about the Untouchable since I don't like Primanti's sandwiches, but the pizza was more than decent. Unfortunately, they don't deliver to us, so we had to go there to get it."
"2","New location in Rostraver! Great wings! Take out wings are usually soggy or\nOver cooked...not these! Cajun and buffalo are Amazing!"
"2","Old-times feel, but they have awesome hoagies, great pizza, and very good italian food.\n\nThey do deliver, and pretty much anything on the menu is able to be ordered for delivery.  The drinks are by the can or by the 2-liter.\n\nIn-store, you place the order and they'll either hand it to you at the counter or bring it out to you.  There is very limited seating.\n\nYou can call in your order and pick it up, too.\n\nDefinitely would recommend."
"2","Nice people, and they never screw up my tailoring. Whenever I ask for an item to be done at a certain time they will get it done. Then I tell them I don't need it that fast and wait at least two weeks before picking it up. I wish the Taco Bell was still close by."
"1","The good: The ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful. Also, if you live in the area, it's certainly convenient. The alterations are well done. \n\nThe bad: Their alterations manager won't give you an estimate for the work before he does it. Not even a ballpark. So basically, you drop your clothes off, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. Expect the work (even something simple like hemming) to take more than a week, and cost a fair amount. \n\nIn summary: Good work, friendly but slow service, expensive. If it weren't so convenient I doubt I'd go back."
"1","If you want to be completely ignored when you walk into a business, then this is the place for you. I walked into this bakery at 4:40PM. There were 2 customers ahead of me and 2 ladies behind the counter. One was waiting on the customers while the other\nseemed to be more interested in getting the place ready for closing at 5:00PM and\nsocializing with someone who walked in after me and was obviously just visiting the lady. The other lady finished with her customer and then walked back to the back of the store and they both completely ignored me for a good 5 minutes while I was waiting by the cake case too buy a cake. Ten minutes later I finally asked them exactly how much longer they were going to ignore me and walked out. I them came back to ask for the owner's name and was told it was Ron. Well Ron, this incident cost you $17.99 which I was going to spend on a Tiramasu cake and also lost you a good customer. I also plan to tell my family and friends NOT to shop here. TERRIBLE SERVICE."
"1","Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays.  Called at 1:50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back."
"1","Went to the monroeville location using a groupon for the free tooth whitening.  The first visit, they said i had cavities that needed filled...ok...so I got them filled the same day....and they weren't filled smoothly!!  I had to come back to get the filling smoothed out because they left a ridge and it was bothering my mouth!! \n\nthey also said i needed MI paste (for $30 from them when online it's ~$15)....ok...so i got that as well not knowing it was something I could get outside of the office\n\nI had to come back in for deep cleaning.  When i got there however and went through the process, the \""deep cleaning\"" didn't seem like a deep cleaning at all.  The initial cleaning the first day seemed more thorough and hurt longer. They did all four quadrants in one session, no novicaine (which if you've had a deep cleaning before...it HURTS.....I needed the nitrous oxide the last time I had one.....and it hurt for multiple weeks after as well when I went before).  One of my friends that also has had deep cleanings also said that they're painful and hurt for days afterwards.  This one instead didn't hurt except when i was poked a few times, and i was fine to eat/etc right afterwards.\n\nWhile getting the deep cleaning the hygenist (because I never saw the dentist except for the fillings when in the past I saw them for deep cleanings as well) said that my mouth was much better and that she thought the pockets (the reason for the deep cleaning) were probably false pockets, that my mouth was much better than the previous month, that I probably didn't need the deep cleaning and that no antibiotic would be needed...maybe if I came in next time I would need them.  So I got a deep cleaning that I may not have needed, didn't feel like a deep cleaning, and set me back $900....in about an hour (they also usually take longer)\n\nPoor experiences multiple times...\n\noh--and never met Carl."
"1","If you are fearful of going to the dentist, or if you put off going to the dentist for financial reasons, do not go to him! He will lecture you for not going. His bedside manner is terrible. I didn't appreciate the sarcastic comment \""See you in 2020\"" as he left the room.  \n\nWill not go back. Instead I will find a dentist who is sensitive to my fear of pain.\n\nUPDATE 12/18/2013:\nSo I went to another dentist to get my gum fillings filled (which he put in back in 2006 and informed me I needed to have them done again last week). Guess what, I DON'T NEED TO HAVE THEM FILLED! The dentist informed me that Sensodyne should solve the problem. He told me that there isn't a whole near my gum line so the procedure is unnecessary, and if it Sensodyne doesn't help they have a special sealant they can use on me in the future (lasts only 9 months). No drilling! So I basically saved myself over a hundred dollars and two shots of novicane.  I'm so, so angry with myself for letting him convince me to do these \""fillings\"" 6 years ago when all I needed was a special toothpaste! \n\nNot only did they ridicule me for waiting 4 years to get my teeth cleaned, they also ridiculed me for putting off these so-called gum fillings.  To find out that I didn't need to have them done in the first place is infuriating! His lecturing was completely unnecessary! \n\nI've never seen a medical professional so money hungry before in my life.  Very, very unhappy with his service!"
"2","Definitely a Chinese gem in the South Hills!  Family owned and operated.  It's a husband (chef) and wife (waitress) team that owns/runs the place and my family and I have been coming here for years.  \n\nThe food has always been good and fresh.  I always get a bowl of their rice soup and it always hits the spot.  I know that's it's probably a very simple dish to make, but that's definitely my go-to appetizer at this place.  Also the egg roll isn't greasy but always crispy and fresh so I highly recommend.\n\nWe usually order the chicken with garlic sauce and a beef dish and haven't been disappointed.  When it gets crowded, service can be slower but be patient since it's only the husband and wife team that are holding down the fort.  \n\nI feel like it's one of those places that people go to for years and get to know the owners and the owners get to know you, so definitely worth 5 stars in my opinion."
"2","Great family run restaurant . I have been going here for 20 years . the food is great and the owner who is the only waitress treats you like family ."
"1","A typical tavern with a basic bar menu of burgers, sandwiches, and fried munchies. The deep fried jalapeno pretzel is a great change from the usual fries, or cheese sticks. I usually order the fried fish sandwich, which is a great size, and filling. Service is okay, casual, and prompt. The main dining area away from the bar, is nice, and quiet, full of Pittsburgh sports memorabilia. Not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order. Love their witty signs they put up to get you thinking as you drive down Rt. 88 which seems to be a never ending construction zone."
"1","Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing, especially after I picked one up and it had feathers coming out of it. I understand things happen, but the situation was handled very unprofessionally. I'm not sure if our server was embarrassed, but it seemed as though we were avoided after the issue was brought to her attention."
"1","Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy, and the bacon was minimal. It's just a little shack of a joint on a desolate street where you'd think you might meet Freddie Kruger after dark! But Darren was dying to go here just so he could review it, and it sucked, didn't it sweetie? ;) They didn't even deliver to us. I had to drive him there just to get it, and you can't eat in either. Cash only. Avoid.\n\nWe could have ordered from Slice, which I like and is in our hood, but noooo...\n\n:D"
"1","Worst nail salon ever. \n\nI made the mistake of buying a Groupon for a mani/pedi here without really doing any research. Not a smart move on my part. The place was totally dusty and there was no AC. Being that it was like 90 degrees that day, it was hotter inside than outside. The manicurist, who was very chatty and nice enough for one star, didn't put any lotion on my hands, or clean my nails at all-- just quickly filed them and slopped on the polish. The top coat gathered in some parts and made it look thick and chunky- completely uneven. \n\nWhen I stuck my hand in the dryer, I accidently bumped and smudged a nail.....and her remedy (wait for it...) was to LICK HER FINGER AND BLOT HER SALIVA OVER THE POLISH. I just kinda stared at her in shock, unable to speak. \n\nMaybe folks in Castle Shannon are into this kind of vibe, but I will continue to stay within city limits the next time I feel like endulging. It was just a bad scene."
"1","I would absolutely not return to this salon. My nail tech was nice enough, very chatty and personable. But the other techs there were very catty talking about everyone and their neighbor. The parrafin dip felt nice but the wax contraption was on the floor and very uncomfortable getting in and out of. Now on to the manicure. My natural nails were very long and I asked for a short/square shape. I got a strange mixture of short, semi short, square and round. The polish application was absolutely terrible, uneven and up to and over the cuticle with no clean up. I've never seen such a mess and can actually do a better job myself. This made me question whether or not she was professionally trained. I should have questioned her but at this point I just wanted to get out of there. I went home, removed the polish and reapplied myself. What a complete waste."
"1","They do an okay job, but I find this place is VERY expensive and while they do an ok job, they don't do a great job.  You can find the same or better manicure near by, for half the price."
"1","I had a mani pedi today and they were brutal....so painful!  Ask her to just push your cuticles back otherwise youre in for some pain.  She actually cut me during my manicure and I had to ask her to quit f ing cutting my cuticles it bled so bad.  It's like having the worst papercut you can imagine then it really did not feel good at all the one she put acetone on it.\n\n\nI literally had to take my hand away from her and say stop let's not mess with my cuticles anymore! The owner was sitting right there and didn't do anything or say anything. \n\nnow I've got a gold sparkly nail with a nasty ass, scab around it  she apologized but she cut my freaking hand I was really unhappy and I will never go back. Also see the picture of the lovely job she did on the manicure the color was not on evenly and it looked like a five year old did it.  The pedicure it was really good but it was just so painful if you can book with somebody else but do not let this woman near your cuticles and tell her to be gentle because she certainly wasn't with me.\n\nPart of why I am so freaked out about being cut is that my nail got painted with that lovely sparkly gold nail polish while I was still kind of bleeding. That can't be hygienic I mean you should all know that I am perfectly healthy and hepatitis free, that is a communal bottle of nail polish! And I was bleeding! I feel like a kind of is a really big deal.\n\nPlease know that I hate leaving bad reviews. But they made me bleed! And the pedicure was really really painful! I would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome. The salon was very very clean and the technicians were very nice.\n\nBut I left stressed and bleeding!"
"2","Signature Desserts is the ONLY bakery I will go to. Not only are they reasonable priced, their desserts are out of this world and their work is fantastic.\n\nI used them for my wedding cake and dessert table. Let me tell you, beyond impressed. I ordered a three tiered cake with an intricate design, 5 addtional 8 inch cakes for the dessert table, and 8 dozen cookies. All of this, including delivery and multiple consultations was under $500!!!!! I was so happy with my dessert table, everything turned out absolutely beautiful, like out of a wedding catalog!!!\n\nLinda and her husband are such wonderful, warm people and they made this experience so wonderful and stress free for me!!! \n\nI would reccomend them for every bakery need you have!!!!"
"1","Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon."
"2","It's Calabria's - what more can you say. Great good, reasonable prices, and a nice, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThis location and the Upper St. Clair location are both winners. Everything is homemade. The restaurants are super clean, the menu has a nice variety, and the staff is always friendly and helpful."
"1","If you like waterlogged pasta, runny sauce and food that really is not that good, by all means eat here.  \n\nWater is cold, so that's a plus."
"1","My family and I stopped here tonight. We live very close and have yet to ever go. What a mistake. When you first walk in, you are assaulted with pastel palette and an over abundance of mauve. This is more 80's than my grandmothers house. I could ignore the decor if the service was better. It was horrible. Our waitress came twice then disappeared.  Apparently she went home sick and no one else came to pick up our table for over 20 min. Smooth. So when we finally got our food, I was really hoping for greatness. I don't know why I was expecting good food when everything else wasn't.  I ordered veal with peppers.  17.99. I got less than a third of a pepper on my plate with 3 tiny, extremely thin, tough pieces of veal. It was supposed to be served with a brandy sherry sauce. Nope. It was a white wine butter sauce. The description also didn't mention the veal was scallopine. It was. Probably could of given myself a paper cut with these. The experience was awful, the service was horrendous, the decor cannot be unseen, and everything was a good 5 to 7 dollars over priced. Will never go back to this place again."
"1","Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with, a side of vinegar, surprised they didn't charge us for the extra napkins. Service was terrible to boot. Never will go back. You'd have better service and food at Olive Garden...and that's hard for me to say."
"1","Sad little place, even by Pittsburgh standards. Ambience of a funeral parlor, with average age of patrons about 69. Exemplary Calabria's dish? Oriental chicken salad garnished with uncooked ramen noodles."
"1","Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there."
"1","Very unhappy with the sales people did not do what they said they would do service department is very good"
"2","Being new to the area, I get recommendations from a couple of guys I work with who were born and raised in Baldwin, on the best places to eat, shop, etc.  \n\nI was informed yesterday that Danny's has the best Italian hoagies around.  So I HAD to try one for dinner.  It has the perfect amount of meat seasoning and topping.  The onions were a little heavy for me, but being my first time, I took it as it came.  The bread is perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft on the inside.  In all, I was given good information by my coworkers.  I would rank it in my top 3 of Italian hoagies.  Darren W's. review on the pizza sounds great too.....looking forward to trying it."
"2","I went to  Danny's on a recommendation from a friend whose opinion I  highly value,  especially when it comes to food.  When we arrived,  we were warmly greeted by Jorge and Francesco, who would be making our food that evening.   Since I had been told that this place serves the most delicious Italian hoagie ever made, we got one Italian hoagie to split. We waited a very reasonable ten minutes and it was ready.  The portion was good,  it was enough to fill us both up.  It came with just the right amount of veggies (I got extra tomatoes on my half),  and the perfect amount of dressing. Enough to add moisture and flavor,  not so much it was dripping everywhere.  There was no sogginess  in the bun at all. It was toasted a nice light brown color,  not that nasty halfway toasting that gives no color and makes the bread crusty like it sat out all day. The great service and a variety of Italian meats (warm and juicy but not too hot) made this one if the best hoagies I ever had.  Definitely go there!"
"1","I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball Parmigiana sub. for dinner. Apparently Danny doesn't understand what this is or..doesn't know how to make one. I was told they have a meatball sub or a chicken parmigiana sub...but not a meatball parmigiana sub.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to split a sub roll down the middle, add 6-8 meatballs (depends on size), red sauce/gravy cover with mozzarella cheese and throw in the oven till the cheese is melted...Danny if you read this you owe me for this recipe!!  Give me a break. I left without my sub and got one from Italian Village Pizza just down the street. Dude this is not rocket science..."
"2","Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget the meatball sub guy. Pizza is quite good, too. But get the hoagie."
"1","I just got back from dinner with my family at the old place and I can't emphasize enough my disappointment. The service was poor. Our waitress was a nice gal who was working hard, she simply had too many tables because the place was woefully understaffed. Our drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner and she was usually too busy to check on us. I had to go and find her a few times to get things that were missed. \n\nI don't mind paying the high prices of the old place if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was a let down. Four of us ordered the French onion soup. The soup was so salty it was rendered uneatable. The steak was good, but the baked potato was so dry I thought it left over from lunch. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and it was quite bland. Everything else we ordered was just ok. To sum it up, our meal was mediocre at best and we were all disappointed. Not one person on our party of seven really enjoyed their meal. \n\nI express my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she informed me that she would write my complaints in a book they kept. That was it. I left with the feeling that they were happy that they got my money and that they did not really care that my family's dinner was poor. They made no effort to make it right and they made no effect to ease my displeasure. \n\nThis will be my last family dinner at the old place. I will take my business to a place that has better food and a place that values it's customers."
"2","I will start out by saying that for the most part, our meals were very good, but they were overshadowed by a lousy server.   We waited forever for a drink order and then even longer just to place our order.\n\nMy husband ordered the French onion soup, which is a favorite for both of us.   I can say without a doubt that it was the worst we have ever eaten.   Visually, it looked appealing, with lots of cheese and crunchy onions on top, but once you pulled the cheese back, it was a bowlful of bread cubes soaked in broth.   There was absolutely no broth to speak of, so it was like eating mushy bread.   He ate a few spoonfuls and that was it.   We should have complained, but thought the server should have noticed that it wasn't eaten and asked about it.   Unfortunately she brought his salad at the same time, so he had plates all around him.  I had the wedding soup which was excellent.  Loaded with all the typical wedding soup ingredients, and thick and tasty.\n\nMy husband had the pork chops, which were tender and juicy.  My Mom had a chicken dish, smothered in onions and gravy which she liked.   They both had plenty of leftovers.   The winner was my veal martini.  Veal slices, lightly breaded and fried, with a two cheese sauce which was excellent.   We all had the twice baked potatoes which were just OK.\n\nOur server never checked on us, never offered drink re-fills, and overall it was frustrating."
"1","I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I had originally started coming here because I bought a groupon and was looking for a new stylist.\n\nMy total experience here includes 3 haircuts, eye brow wax, and a full head of highlights. The highlights were the icing on the cake and definitely are what made me not want to go back for good.\n\nMy stylist was a very personable woman, but in the end she wasn't very good on listening to what I wanted. 3 seperate times I did not get what I asked for.\n\nThe absolute worst part about this place though is that every single time I've been here I've been rushed in and out and felt very unappreciated. Whoever is running the books and appointments there really needs to get their act together. If you can't handle high traffic then do not OVER BOOK yourselves. I've schedueled all of my appointments well in advance, so it's not like they were squeezing me in.\n\nAtmosphere is also stuffy and unwelcoming. \n\nI decided to give it 2 stars since my stylist was a very nice lady."
"1","GO TO PLAN B!  This is NOT a shop you want to give your business!  I have been a very good and generous customer for too many years.  If you are in Linda's chair (one of the owner's) you will get an excellent cut/color BUT, you will wait!!!!  And wait.  I can't remember a time I raced to get there and did not have to wait 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, even an hour, b/c she tries to do too many things,  and so, you wait!!!!  Also, I recently went to get a hair cut and she lost her focus, b/c she had to stop and finish someone and then stop again to check foils and then stop again to answer questions and she totally changed my style (that I was growing out 6-7 months) and she knew when I left I was not happy, but she said to blow it out myself tomorrow and it would be okay, it wasn't and when I told her it was a terrible, the worst, with no rhyme or reason, and that it took me an hour to blow out and how frustrated I was, she imploded on me for 40 min, telling me she couldn't look at me!  It was ALL about HER and not my terrible hair cut that I had to force her to fix, making it even shorter and still treated me horribly, no one believes my story, that ME, being the customer, she didn't care or try to make it better at MY convenience,and after all those years.  Her partner, her sister offered me a refund, I never asked, and I still have the voicemail confirming our talk and the refund and yet, no refund. After all the wks of aggrevation and  frustration, they shot their integrity to hell over a $49 check!  REALLY?  STAY AWAY!  There are many other salons that do really good work and you are geared to the customer.  I found one I love and there were many recommendations to me.  So, go to Plan B, Plan A, Hairtique, nah!"
"1","I DID like this place for over 30 years and was a customer of Linda, one of the owners for that long.  I was always good to her and we were 'friends'.  My last appointment there she was too busy dealing with interruptions (phone call, checking foils and stopping in mid-stream to finish off someone), as she is with every single appointment I have ever had. She lost her focus on what I wanted and cut away, totally changing my cut and I was not happy with the results.  She told me to go home and work with it the next day.  The next day came and it was a mess, when I told her her, her LARGE ego was hurt and a wk later she ripped me a new behind b/c I didn't like my cut.  Really?  This is how you treat a long-time customer, yell at them for 45 min b/c your ego was hurt?  At first she REFUSED to fix the cut.  After I TOLD her she would fix it, did she then do it.  She then totally screwed me, by cancelling my root color at the last moment a week later!  STAY AWAY FROM HER!!!   You wait and wait at every single appointment, and unless you have much time to kill, go somewhere else.  I am much happier since I left, there IS life after Linda @ Hairtique.  AND, they have NO integrity.  I talked to her sister Chris, after the ordeal was over and she offered me a refund, twice!  I still have the voicemail offering it to me,   Linda REFUSED to refund the service, even tho I was inconvenienced for 2 wks and did it at HER convenience.  Do yourself a favor and keep stress to a limit, as well as your time and find anther place to go.  Please note:  I am not the first customer of over 30 yrs who treated her very well that she has done this too.  It is HER way or you are out the door!  There is NO arguing with her BIG ego!  Stay away, far too much drama between the two sisters!"
"1","I set up my appointment a week in advance.  I was told it was not an issue to get it done in one day.  When I showed up at the scheduled time, I was told \""oh was that today?\""  Late in the day I called to see if I could pick up my car and it wasn't done and was told it would not be done until the next day.  When I went to pick it up the following day I asked what happened.  The guy,(George) who had mishandled my experience from the beginning, proceeded to blame me saying that there was no way that job could be done in one day.  If you'd like to be blamed for their shortcomings, you should take your vehicle here."
"2","I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work."
"1","The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future."
"2","I personally believe that this is one of the nicer GE in the area. For some reason the inner-city ones seem dark and dingy. Also, I was at the Waterworks last month and they are renovating this to make it a Market District. If you don't know, now you know ;)"
"1","UGH. I don't know why Pittsburgh has allowed Giant Eagle to basically have a monopoly on groceries in this city. Yeah, sure, we have some smaller niche grocers and a few low-cost players that have moved into town recently, but let's face it -- in the all-encompassing big supermarket space, there really is no true competition. The market pretty much belongs to Giant Eagle. What I wouldn't give for Wegman's to expand into the Burgh...but I digress.\n\nLimited competition means that Giant Eagle stores can be consistently subpar and people will shop there anyway. Ok, so to be fair, this Giant Eagle isn't among the worst locations as far as Giant Eagles are concerned -- the South Side and Squirrel Hill locations that I used to frequent take that honor. So I'll give this location an extra star for not being the suckiest of a sucky chain of stores. But even this supposed 'nicer' Giant Eagle still doesn't cut it in the grand scheme of supermarkets.\n\nMy main beefs? First and foremost (and this applies to all GEagles) -- the prices. The prices are downright insulting. Yeah, yeah, sometimes they have sales (oh boy, how nice of them!), which take their sky-high prices and bring them down to what most other grocery stores would charge on a normal day. So I hope that your shopping list contains nothing but items on \""sale,\"" because otherwise you're out of luck. \n\nSecond, this location seems to consistently be out of stock of basic items every time I come in here. Just yesterday I went in for two things -- baby spinach and sandwich wraps. Two things. And BOTH items were out of stock. I'm sorry, I know that it's the weekend and it's busy, but how about you try to keep up with demand? Is that too much to ask? This is not the first time I've gone in for just a few items and have left without them because the shelves were empty. For a store the size of Giant Eagle, I expect more.\n\nThird, I've personally had issues with meat quality here. Specifically, I've found their Nature's Basket chicken breast to be consistently tough and stringy -- almost inedible. The first time, I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. The second time, I started to get suspicious about the quality. And the third time (several weeks later) when it still had the nasty texture issues, I vowed to never buy chicken there again (and I haven't). As a dubious ex-president once said, \""Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\""\n\nLastly, I've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location. For example, the latest instance came about a month ago. When we went to check out, my hubby put his basket on the conveyor belt without emptying it. Now I used to work at a grocery store when I was a teenager, and I would get frustrated when people were too lazy to put their items on the belt. It's annoying, I get it. I really do. But my hubby didn't know any better. And when this would happen to me as a cashier (which was often), I would smile and take the items out of the basket one by one and scan them (albeit secretly cursing the customer in my head). But Kayla, our cashier? She gave a pissed-off sigh, rolled her eyes....and then literally took the basket, held it pointedly up about a foot or two over the belt, and deliberately dumped it upside down so everything came crashing down at once. We had some fragile things in there (strawberries, blueberries, and eggs) that were damaged from the impact. Completely unacceptable!\n\nSigh. I have countless additional stories about how awful Giant Eagle is, but my fingers are getting tired, and if Yelp doesn't already have a word limit, they would probably consider putting one into place if I keep going.  :)  \n\nOk, one last thing, and then I'm outta here, I swear. They are currently renovating this location to be a Market District (slated to open in early 2015), so we can all look forward to that. Sorry, GEagle, but you ain't foolin' anyone -- you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. \n\nAll right, now I'm really done.  :)"
"2","I can eat a submarine just about any day of the week and it's probably a good thing that I don't live close by to \""Uncle Sam's,\"" because I would.  I have only been here a few times, but have never been disappointed.  I have tried an array of sub shops in my time and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones.  The menu boasts a wide variety of subs and toppings including a Vegetarian menu, if you are in to that, but what separates it from most places is their emphasis on the Cheese Steak and their generous portions of meat.  Most shops around here tend to be a little lean on the meat and they more than compensate you for your dollar.  A regular does me just fine, but for those of a more carnivorous nature, they also have their Ultra menu which gives you double the meat if not more.  Another thing that i find refreshing is their Shoestring french fries, that they provide you with as a side if you dine in extra if you take out.  They also offer a Chicken Cheese Steak, which is also difficult to find in most shops.  Drink wise, they offer a variety of craft soda, craft beer, and of course your fountain.  Refills are extra. \n\nOnto the Service.  In all honesty it can be a little hit or miss.  I have gone and have had great service where my food is ready and brought out immediately and there have been times where I have sat and waited a bit too long.  Having worked in food service I understand that it isn't perfect every time, but generally the wait is worth with it.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant is Cash Only.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a sub shop with character and delicious hoagies I would highly recommend it.  If subs aren't your thing the \""Burgatory\"" and \""Panera Bread\"" are next door."
"1","I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so, but within the last few years, it has gone severely downhill. The food is greasy, way too expensive, and they use massive amounts of MSG. I got terrible MSG poisoning from Tai Pei and ever since then, have gone to Jimmy Wan's down the road."
"2","Consistently excellent.  I enjoy their sushi and know when I get a chicken dish I don't have to guess if it is eatable always good white meat.   I typically do take out and it is well worth the drive"
"1","We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. \n\nWe ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup, the black bean chicken, szechuan beef, and lamb with scallions. \n\nThe soup was awesome! Very spicy!\n\nThe rest of the food was awful. It was tasteless... the meat had a weird fluffy texture.... there was zero flavor. It was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager. \n\nHe said the kitchen would make new dishes. \n\nThey brought three new entrees. They were again completely flavorless, but warmer. I couldn't taste salt or pepper  or garlic or even feel any heat. It was awful. \n\nWe paid and left. \n\nyuck. \n\nI used to go here as a child. I remember the sushi was always good. Maybe that is the thing to order!"
"1","I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service, but I felt like the food was just \""okay.\""  Nothing to brag/boast about.  Prices are fair.  Maybe so many groupons because not enough people are raving about it?"
"2","Excellent Chinese food.   Every time we have ordered take out from here, it's been great.  Egg Rolls, General Tso's, Happy Family, Triple Delight, dumplings...all taste delicious."
"1","just got back from TaiPei. today was dinner AND a floor show. First, the food was adequate, except for the won ton for two which was full of won tons, shrimp and chicken. with a light and not greasy broth.It was good.  The floor show erupted soon after we were seated, when a young woman across the way began to harangue her mother...her mom apparently hadn't gone to enough of her soccor games as a child, didnot know the names of her teammates, had never taken a picture of her on the field, and couldn't make up her mind about getting a f&^%ing iphone 5....i know all this because she wasn't shy about letting everyone in the restaurant hear her, or letting the expletives fly. apparently no one has ever told her to knock it off, including and especially from my perspective, the manager of taiPei. He stood across the room with his mouth agape in shock, but with no concern about the comfort of his other patrons and their dining experience. It was a bizarre and uncomfortable experience, and follows a pattern of poor management decisions i have seen at tai pei recently.They know how to take in the money, but are less than concerned with anything else."
"2","I have only had takeout from Tai Pei, but the chicken lo mein was delicious and the general tso's was the best I have ever had! It was sweet, but still had a kick to it. Nothing was over priced and we weren't waiting forever for delivery. Will definitely visit the restaurant in the future!"
"2","The food here is very good. I've frequented the restaurant many times for sushi, noodles, rice, and plenty of their other dishes. The atmosphere is also great and the service is very friendly. I would definitely recommend Taipei if you're craving Chinese and sushi."
"1","Food was very bland, i even asked that they kick it up a notch.  I traveled to this area from Northern Virginia.  I never had such bland Chinese food in all my travels.  I have had worse, the Scallops and Shrimp were fresh, the rice was cooked well.  Went here after my Brothers raved about it..."
"1","I ordered from this place and the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when they delivered my order. The woman not only rang my doorbell 5 times but she BANGED, and I mean BANGED, on our window of our house without even a second of wait in between. When I opened the door the woman threw my food at me and told me never to order again as she called me TWICE with no answer (my fianc\u00e9 was upstairs sleeping with his phone, but our home is clearly marked and we've never had problems before). I handed her the money and told her I wasn't giving her a tip then and she LOST IT. I closed the door and she walked away. What in the actual heck? You guys lost a customer forever and I'll never recommend you to anyone. That was insanely rude."
"2","We have a new puppy...  Chocolate lab.  So far he's had Parvo, giardia, worms, and probably stuff we don't even know!  He is very healthy now.  VCA was very accommodating, saw us quickly, and even helped us out a few times without charging (quick consults).  We highly recommend VCA"
"1","They charged me $512 for a single visit with 2 rabbits WITHOUT ANY HEADS-UP - and they most definitely did NOT provide $512 worth of services. I was sick to my stomach when I left. VCA Fox Chapel is a rip off and they provide a disservice to animals and pet owners. \n\nAfter seeing the breakdown of the bill, I could't believe how much they charged. The one rabbit is (per statement vet) not going to get better. Yet, he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs. He also drew blood from the other bunny and yelled similar codes to the back. Turns out each of these \""codes\"" he yelled back was a blood test for which they charged about $60 a piece. The one bunny also got 2 injections: 0.3 ml of PenG was $41.72 (mind the fact that I have this bottle of PenG at home because the vet put the other bunny on this medication weeks ago, so he should/ could have remembered that and just let me give the injection at home if that's what they charge for this! And the whole 100 ml bottle was about $8 at the store) and 0.1 ml (yes, a tiny tiny amount) of Metacam for $43.34. The base consultation is $77 for a bunny. \n\nThe office manager later told me that I should have just asked about costs during the visit (and kindly offered to put a note on my file that I am a customer who would like to be informed about costs (of course, there will be no next time)). When I explained that I feel that the vet has a responsibility to keep a pet owner posted when he is about to rack up a hefty bill with a bunch of tests, she said that the vet just wanted to be thorough. I think that the vet or the vet tech knew exactly what kind of charges they were incurring and I am so mad and disappointed that they abused the situation. \nWhen the check-out lady saw how flabbergasted I was, she asked if I told the vet I had money trouble. Money trouble? Because I'm not prepared to pay $512 for a single visit? All I can do at this point is warn other people not to go to the Fox Chapel VCA..."
"1","I will never again visit the VCA Fox Chapel, and I caution against you doing so as well.  I took my extremely ill, very old cat there two days ago and we were dismissed out of hand.  No tests were run by Dr. Resek and we were sent out the door with a diagnosis of general food poisoning.  This morning, my cat's condition was visibly worse - she has not eaten in four days - and I called them for counsel.  After 2 five-minute long periods of holding, I was again dismissed by the office staff and told that the recommendation of the doctor was to continue feeding her bland food.  MY CAT IS NOT EATING.  \n\nThey were also kind enough to offer me the option of coming in at an elevated \""emergency rate.\""  Thanks, but no.  I instead took her to another provider who was thoughtful, thorough and who diagnosed her with acute kidney failure.\n\nMy question to the folks at VCA Fox Chapel is this: if you do not care about sick animals, why are you in the veterinary profession? I will be posing this question to them directly.\n\nIn the meantime, I advise you, Reader, if you do care about your animal to NOT TAKE IT TO VCA.  They are, in my opinion, directly responsible for the unnecessarily prolonged suffering of my dearest friend - an elderly sweetheart who at this stage in her life deserves far, far better.\n\n(And I would like to point out that I granted them one star because Yelp made me.)"
"2","Truly, the kindest, most gentle vets I have ever met! We recently moved to Pittsburgh, and one of my cats was dealing with an ongoing sickness. We went to VCA Fox Chapel, and I was pleasantly surprised by how kind, caring, and gentle the doctors were. We worked with Dr. Miggins and Dr. Resek. In the end, we ended up having to put our cat to sleep. Even then, Dr. Resek was amazingly patient and kind, and gave us the time and space we needed. Yes, they are expensive. But you are getting great care and more than that, you can rest assured that they truly have your pets' best interest in mind."
"1","Somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review.\n\nBefore I begin, let me say that I have been to other Coffee Tree Roasters. I also am an avid coffee drinker and therefore have a fair amount of knowledge that can be used to compare this place with others.\n\nI visited awhile back. Upon arriving I immediately didn't feel welcome. There were four baristas there and I had to wait over a minute before one of them even greeted me. After ordering I decided upon a mocha. It tasted like hot chocolate. Where was the coffee flavor? All the while I noticed the four baristas standing in a corner laughing with one another while giving off an \""exclusive high school club\"" vibe. Geez!\n\nAND....when I left (mind you there was only one other customer in the lobby) I took up my dishware, as well as some others on a nearby table and the dude working just gave me a look and didn't even say thank you! Things like that really bother me. Let me tell you, as somebody who has worked in retail and food it can be a PAIN to be friendly towards customers, but it's just something that should be done in that business.\n\nBottom line: Not terrible, but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service. I highly recommend the Caribou Coffee right across the street. The baristas have always been pleasant and the drinks quite good! I have had far better experiences at the Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill which tells me that this one certainly can become better!"
"2","Good prices, better coffee.  The food never looks good so I haven't tried it.\n\nI sometimes stop here for coffee before work, the baristas are always friendly--even at 6:02 am, right after opening. If you're in the area I recommend it over the Starbuckses (what is the plural of that?!) in Giant Eagle or B&N in the waterworks mall."
"1","Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error, but on two separate occasions I was charged twice for the same cup of coffee and pastry here. Both times I went in, and they promptly rectified it - but kind of annoying, no?"
"1","Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business."
"2","Excellent espresso, with quick service.  Priced right too.  Parking can be a little tricky but worth the stop."
"1","I have purchased many high end pieces of luggage (Tumi, Briggs & Riley) from this location with the understanding that they are adding value to my purchase over that of online or airport retailers should I need a repair as they are certainly not less expensive.  Well One of my B&R bags is in need of repair.  The bag was purchased Dec-2012 so it is not that old and it is indeed covered under the lifetime repair of B&R.   I stopped in today to see what could be done.  They could not repair the bag and did offer to send the bag back to B&R for me for the small fee of $35+tax. Really, I could walk down the road a bit and have the UPS store ship it for half that price.  What value are they providing me?   It is a shame that the brick and mortar stores are unable to provide value over online and this is one easy way to do it.  A Shame since I used to be a really good customer."
"2","I tend to prefer this location of Thai Place because it is always so quiet.  The menu seems to be identical to that of the Walnut Street location.  \n\nAll of the curry dishes are good here, as are some of the simpler dishes.  I especially like the Penang curry, and the sauce for the chicken with garlic is excellent.  They also include a lot of really good, fresh vegetables in all of their dishes, which, to me, is a plus.  While I haven't tried many of them, the chef's specials seem to be very original to the restaurant. \n\nThe service is always prompt and excellent.  The only drawback to that I can think of is that the prices are a bit high, compared to other Thai restaurants.  However, I always leave Thai Place feeling pleased and satisfied."
"2","Great place for weekday lunch.  Best Pad Thai around."
"1","Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!"
"1","First and far most people , I never write a bad review.  So imagine what an average experience I had. Actually, this isn't even a bad review. OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/"
"2","This was one of the best music stores that I've visited in Pittsburgh. Though not the best in Pennsylvania it had a pretty good variety of instruments and the prices weren't insane either! They had a used section that was full of guitars, amps, keyboards, and other instruments to tickle your fancy. I was particularly interested in the keyboards and ukuleles and was very pleased! \n\nIf you're a guitar fanatic you'll definitely love it here. The service was very helpful and really friendly as well."
"2","Best place in town for all your keys/synths needs. Ask for Tony or anyone really , everyone is very helpful"
"1","The sale/price/trade all went smoothly.  The salesman proundly presented a clean carfax.  The car has been good except:\n1.  a google search of the vin revealed that the front bumper, front  fender, doors, and rear fender had all been replaced at the auction house (manheim) apparently to escape Carfax. All of this was on the sales slip from Manheim.  The sales guy had to know, although he claimed the buyer never told him.   Slick. \n2.  after a flat tire, it was discovered the spare was missing.  after maybe 10 phone calls, and another 10 emails, several visits, and a month, a new wheel (non matching) and tire were provided. \n3.  Several serious car people have told me that they are known for scratch and dent cars, hence the on-site body shop.  \n\nThose the facts in the case, as I know them."
"2","Best cigar selection in Pittsburgh. Their pipe tobacco blends are fantastic, I recommend RLP-6. Great atmosphere!"
"1","We went to this place also after seeing it on D,D,and D.\nThis was after the smoking in places that serve food was put in place. We went with my sister and her not even toddler my two children and ... well we get to the location and almost turned around \""its just a bar\"" Defiantly a dive! Took a while to get our food. The bar was loud and smokey! I orderd the perogies since that is why we went there. My son ordered a fish sandwich we orderd a childs spaggetti. some wings and some other things. The fish sandwich was HUGE. biggest i had ever seen.  \n\nThe childs spaggetti was big and was shared with two children My son loved it .. i tasted it because i couldnt belive him. It was good! \n\nTHE PEROIGES ----- BLAND~, soggy, not crisp not buttery ... they were greasy. it tasted like bland mashed potatoes between unseasoned dough. \n\nWe drove well over an hour to eat here. BIG mistake."
"1","The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good."
"1","Man this place is a dump. If you're not a local or regular good luck feeling comfortable there. It is obviously a local bar first and restaurant second. Certainly not for the ladies or kids. The pierogies were indeed delish and the fish sammo was okay. It was cooked nicely but the fish wasn't all that fresh and you could tell. Btw, I did not pre-order pierogies and I got mine no problem. But it wasn't during peak hours. \n\nAs noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender. A bit gruff, but I've had worse. Music was BLASTING non-stop during my hour there. A Nickelback fan's dream com true. Smoky, but not horribly so. \n\nIf you're a local rummy barfly then this place is for you! But if you're a DDD fan you might want to move on to another DDD spot in Pittsburgh. Not sure why it would be featured on the show. Nadine's was better and they made you feel welcome."
"2","They have 4 gourmet cheese sticks with marinara sauce for $7.95. No, I lied, they're not gourmet, they're the frozen kind and they're awful, why would they charge so much for them?\nHowever, this place is fantastic! Lots of Christmas decorations everywhere, and I mean everywhere! They also have karaoke at 8:30, the crowd is older (your parent's age), they dance and sing along; it's a great time. They get packed so expect to stand around, the place is small but no one cares and they will hang out for a while, it's hard to get a table at this smoky \""garage\"". If you don't smoke, you can hang out at the add on but it's not as fun as the bar area. This is the place to have a good time!"
"1","I've driven by this place so many times that I decided to try it for lunch one day. It's not exactly inviting from the exterior or, for that matter, at the front/side door. But if you're hungry or thirsty, you'll overcome any initial reservation you might have just developed. Once inside your visual senses are overwhelmed by what appears to have been an explosion of confetti and Christmas decorations that magically seem to be suspended from the ceiling like psychedelic stalactites. Once you accept that you're in an alternate universe, you can mosey up to the bar or find a seat at one of the small tables. I chose the former and noted the abundance of ash trays scattered all over the bar. Since I'm not a fan of eating where there is a heavy layer of cigarette smoke, I nearly got up and walked out. Luckily, no one at that particular moment was firing one up so I stayed. \n\nI needed a beer (one of those days at work where I felt I owed it to myself to just have one...) but alas, the tap selection consisted of two lite beers (never!) and two summer ales (blue moon and summer shanty - neither of which will ever pass my lips). So I figured it was gonna be one of those days from start to finish and just ordered water. \n\nPerusing the menu left me feeling like this wasn't my day at all so I opted instead for a burger. While it was ok, it wasn't great. Maybe I was so distracted by all the crap hanging over my head and worried for my personal safety that I couldn't properly focus on my meal. Service was good and friendly but the atmosphere and I don't match. And, for that matter,  equivalent bar food can be found at your neighborhood tavern and you won't have to have your senses assaulted. I won't be back."
"1","AWFUL!  The hub bub about the decor, well, it's cheap and trashy. The place REEKS of stale cigarette smoke (and this is coming from a smoker) that hits you like a ton of bricks the moment you walk in the door.\n\nOn a whim, we decided to try Bob's Garage for the first time on Saturday, July 13, 2013. The place was all but empty and no one greeted us or told us where to sit, we just kind of stood by the door waiting to get noticed before finally choosing a table on our own. No verbal greeting or acknowledgment of any kind as we stood there. Ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions. I suddenly felt ill (didn't know at the time, but it was a sudden attack of vertigo), alas, I digress. I felt as if I were going to pass out. Sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said \""Oh, I would have gotten that for you\"" in a very snotty tone, as if we breached some etiquette by NOT asking her for it when she was clearly not attentive. We ordered cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it was not. They were frozen and certainly not worth the price. The waitress could tell I was having some sort of issue and brought our check over \""in case you need to leave suddenly\""...REALLY? She never asked if I was okay, needed her to call someone, needed help or anything, but was more worried about collecting the bill than a customer's well-being. I will NEVER go back there again. Oh, by the way, 2 draught beers, 1 glass of wine (that I did not even sip) and an order of cheese sticks (frozen and not very good) was almost $22, what a rip off!"
"2","As a non-smoker, it takes me a while to get used to the stink. As a karaoke lover, oh yea, it's the best place in the city! I would just come for great karaoke (my husband DJs every Thursday!) and a nice atmosphere."
"2","love love love the steaks they make!!! there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebee's because I want their stake; I eat stakes everywhere, even the Japanese Steak Houses where they only make steaks weren't like Applebee's :)\n\nthe only No at this place was, I oredered pine apple juice and it was so old that it smelled and tasted and kind of even looked like Mold;\n\nbut other than that I love theirr Stakes :)"
"1","Dont' mind me... I'm just practicing for when I don't remember stuff. Like two weeks ago when I stayed here for three days? I was surfing the Pittsburgh yelp pages, and knowing I had to return to Pittsburgh next week for software training, decided to \""check out the hotel\"" that we'd be staying at for four days. When I got to the review page for this Radisson, it hit me....... \""Been there, done that.\""\n\nShort opinion here. Being a native SoCal person, I benefit from a great choice of hotels, throughout the Western states. So for years, when I've had to go back East, I prepare myself for older properties, musty rooms, and usually....... older bathroom fixtures, accompanied by really aged tile grout! If any of the above rings a bell...... you won't be disappointed.\n\nIt's really not that bad, but we West coasters are a bit spoiled. They do have a decent bar-restaurant. But as others have mentioned, this property exists on multiple levels. For instance...... the parking lot in the back? You get off the elevator on the 5th floor. If you're going to the bar, THEN you hit \""Lobby\"" and end up at the bottom of the hillside, which is still elevated above the access road. Sounds a bit convuluted, but it's not that bad. I think I just like to complain a bit....... you get that way after your 39th birthday.   :-)"
"1","I was there for couple of drinks with my friend who was stay a night at the hotel. \nIt was the worst experience i have ever had in a bar in Pittsburgh. When i got there my friend was having dinner at the table and i joined we. I was there only for drinks so i asked the server if i could have a drink but she suggested re restaurant is closed so i will have to get a drink at the bar area. Shortly after that i see her serving other ppl around me in the dinning area and when i asked her about it she told me it was last call and they were also having a drink so it was ok. Honesty it was a weird experience and i wish i could complain to somebody about it being it's such a big chain of hotels. I asked the server If I could talk to the restaurant manager she said sure but the manager never showed up."
"1","Big hotel. Not bad. Bathrooms way too small I had to dry off outside the bathroom. Priceline for good rate."
"1","This hotel is old and janky and the friendly, helpful staff seems to know it. I felt bad for them. I can imagine they deal with a number of complaints so kudos to them for really getting that they are not the problem. \n\nThe entire hotel staff - front desk, house cleaning, shuttle service, restaurant - do try to make your stay pleasant. They really are the only thing this place has going for it. \n\nI actually had to change rooms. I have never done that before but the first room I had apparently had the \""towers\"" AC right above it and it was going to run nonstop. Luckily, it wasn't an issue for me to move. \n\nThe hair dryer shorted out on me both mornings of my two day stay. My hair was dry enough so I was rather amused by this. I needed to print off my boarding pass. The business office is not complimentary here, but they did offer free computer use and printing for boarding passes. Great! Not so great? The fact that the network moved soooooo sssssllllloooowwww that I couldn't get to the area to actually print out the boarding pass in the allotted 15 minutes. The hotel subs out the services for the business office. Not a good idea. \n\nI mentioned at the front desk that I didn't have a room service menu in my room. One of the people working said that was probably because of \""renovations.\"" I'm not sure what the two things have in common at this point, but it wasn't worth it to question it. \n\nAt one point, I was going down the elevator and ran into a woman who was delivering room service. The elevator moved really slow. She sighed and shook her head. \n\n\""This is an interesting hotel,\"" I commented. \n\""Oh yeah,\"" she said with a laugh. \n\nAgain ... not a bad place. It serves its purpose. But God help the souls working there. I think they probably deserve better."
"1","Where to start ... First we checked in after trying to park for seemingly forever (we noticed on the way out - that the sign directing you to the parking deck is only posted on the way OUT of the property - not on the way in so when you come in late and it's dark, you'd never see it!  Room was decent - no complaints for the cost.  We went down to the restaurant to get a snack for my daughter and a glass of wine for me... it took FOREVER!    Finally we got our order and were off to bed ... not!\n\nThere was a group in the room next too us who were talking loudly (almost screaming) and it all came through the door...Our mistake was not calling down to complain (which in retrospect we should have but we kept thinking eventually they would go to bed :(  Finally after 3:30 am it died down.\n\nWhen we went to tell the front desk what happened, the girl had this 'deer in the headlights' look and did express regret we had a problem.  I asked if we could receive a discount on our room and she checked with the manager and quickly came back and said no since we didn't call them about the problem :( but they could comp us a breakfast.  I relayed our story from the night and our feelings we didn't want to return (esp when we saw the line at the hostess stand) but took the voucher since it was that or nothing.\n\nThe restaurant was worse for breakfast.  We stood out by the hostess for at least 10 min and couldn't even get the hostess to let us know how long it would be before be seated.  Two other couples and us were all in the same boat. Hostess was totally overwhelmed. Walked back over to the desk and expressed out findings and she asked us to walk back over.  Long / short the line finally disappated quickly and we were finally seated only to find that there was only a buffet ... so the question that begs to be asked - why was there a line to begin with?!   There were tables and servers?  Bad planning and execution?  Why wasn't there a sign indicating that it was buffet or nothing?  \n\nHonestly, if we didn't have the voucher, we wouldn't have stayed after a walk through the buffet area .... The quality was awful... No plates for oatmeal, stale bagels, beyond runny eggs, undercooked sausage and no pancakes or waffles...\n\nOn an ancillary note, the hotel was swarming with middle, high and possibly college teams.  This didn't bother us since we've been on a dozens of these trips with our daughter.  The problem with it was that the management of the hotel seemingly didn't notice that they were totally booked and staff appropriately for the weekend.  \n\nFor $135+ for a room for the both of us - to stay 8:30 pm until 10:00 am - with all the problems we had with the sound control and service...definitely was not worth it.  The night before we were in the Penn State area and stayed at a Super 8 for a 1/3 of the cost and had a great night sleep and decent free breakfast.  \n\nIf we find ourselves back in the area ... would not stay here or recommend it."
"1","Stayed here overnight and wished we realized how busy of a hotel this place was before checking in. We stayed over a weekend in the summer and upon check in, the lobby was packed with 2 large confereces going on. Not enough parking to accomadate the lounge crowd on Saturday night and hotel guests. We returned back to the hotel after dinner and couldn't find a parking place. Also, next time I am offered a room with a sleep number bed, I will definately pass."
"1","Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done."
"2","My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!"
"2","If you are a homebrewer like myself, having a local place for supplies and knowledge is key. They recently expanded their Noblestown Rd location, and have double the stuff. If you are a wine maker, they have a great selection of wine making tools, supplies, and ingredients, and for the beer brewer, they have a great selection of commercial and in-house extract kits (try their Belgium Wit), grains, dry and liquid yeasts, bottles, caps, and every kind of accessory you can think of. If you've never brewed before, they have reasonably priced starter kits, as well as drafting systems and advanced supplies. The staff is very knowledgeable, although you may get the occasional \""that's a dumb question look.\"" The prices here are a little higher then buying online, but I think it's offsetted by convenience and not paying shipping and handling.\n\nI stumbled into their Country Wines location in the North Hills and found out something that you might find useful- that location has a bigger bottle selection, and they sell clean used bottles for $7.99 a case. Trust me; if you've ever needed used bottles, this is a cheap convenient way to get them. They do not do this at the South Hills location."
"1","I really want to give this place a higher star rating but can't because frankly I have experienced much better in the terms of friendliness and service. This place definitely has everything you need for home wine and beer making but for the most part I feel a store like this should have friendly people working here that are ready and willing to answer your questions or at least when you are the only person in the store.......acknowledge you. \n\nI have been into this store numerous times and have the impression that everyone in here is sort of pissed off to be here. I'm fairly new to home brewing (within the last year and half) and I have questions. This hobby has a lot of questions to be asked, don't act like such a pretentious elite home brewer that I am reluctant to ask my questions. On my last visit the young dude checking me out was literally prying a thank you from his lips. I don't want my ass to be kissed but come on, say hello, can I help you, or thank you have a nice day. I feel that they think that I have to buy products from them although I can easily buy anything that I buy from these guys, on-line. I'm all about keeping it local but if I wanted impersonal service I could order this stuff on-line."
"2","Alrighty, I now officially feel sort of bad about my last review on this place, but it was indeed an honest review that was based on my few experiences at the time. Here is my updated review in which I have been into this store maybe three times in the past six months and the dude I have dealt with here has been generally very helpful. \n\nHis knowledge and time that he took with me to figure out various equipment technical details to update my draft system was really appreciated. I also truly appreciated his honesty when he wasn't sure what the correct answer was on the grains I wanted to use for a recipe. I won't hold it against him that he isn't a fan of IPAs either. \n\nAnother thing that I would like to mention is that their prices here are right in line if not better than most the popular online homebrew stores and you don't have to pay shipping. I am now back on their bandwagon."
"1","This school is a terrible deal for what you pay.  I got my math degree here, and I feel my educations was average at best, so why did I pay twice as much? They don't have rigorous science programs here, and even their beloved pharmacy school seems to be self-serving to artificially inflate graduation rates.\n\n The money does not go to the professors -- many of them are part-time adjuncts who do not earn much, so despite small classrooms, they are burnt out and don't have time to devote to their lesson plans.  I do not support this unethical business practice.  \n\nThe campus itself is garbage, there were cockroaches all through the dorms and food quarters when I was there 2006-2010, the dorms are old and falling apart, there is no campus life to speak of.  \n\nIn general there is just really no reason to come here and pay twice as much money for this garbage school.  I left this school 60k in debt and could have gotten the same or better education elsewhere - I DO NOT recommend this school."
"1","I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. \nI took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.\nJohn (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.\nWe are now going to sue him for damages."
"1","Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!"
"1","Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!"
"2","3x. So far so good."
"1","I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!"
"1","All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway."
"1","I get take-out from here occasionally, purely out of convenience and lack of competition.  During my last pick-up, the evening of 6-22-12, I witnessed a patron quietly complaining about the confusion and lack of separation between those waiting to pay, waiting for an order, and waiting to be seated.  The front waiting area was in mass confusion.  The response from the manager on duty was to insult the patron, saying \""grown men should be able to wait on pizza, and basically, I don't care\"".  This is not an acceptable response for management.  \nThe quality of our pizza is mediocre at best, with the toppings being more than 2 inches from the edge on a hand tossed pizza.  The lady at the register was friendly as usual.\nThis Pizza Hut is not a top choice, but ok in a pinch."
"1","Smells\n\nGood service, good food but the place smells like an old, musty motel room. I'm local and have been there several times and it always smells. There's almost a \""needs cleaning\"" public bathroom tinge to it as well. \n\nYou'll know; stop where the little foyer ends about 15' inside the front door and inhale through your nose.\n\nIt's an old place so it's time for renovation or replacement."
"1","Took my Mom here today for a post Mother's day lunch. It's been about a year since our last visit. Salad bar is a one trip deal only and the salad plates are smaller than I remember last time. Hushpuppies are 2 bite sized and are very good with the right amount of sweetness and onion. My Mom got the senior flounder plate and I got one of the specials which was salt and pepper catfish fillets. Both included a side and the one trip to the salad bar.\nFood was good, but both our flounder and catfish were on the thin side and not very meaty. Service was very friendly and attentive.\nLunch set me back $23 with drinks tax and tip which I thought was really pricey for lunch especially with the thin pieces of fish and considering my Mom ordered off of the senior menu and I got one of the specials."
"1","My wife got food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS....."
"2","Always had great food, Try the clam chowder!!!"
"2","Good seafood and decent prices. If you want fancy food, this isn't the place for you. If you want alcohol with your meal go elsewhere as well. However, if you want good fish/shrimp at a good price served quickly and efficiently - this is your place. You can get fried, broiled or boiled (shrimp)."
"1","The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here."
"1","Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend."
"2","Very good BBQ, and AMAZING onion rings!!!   We are headed there again tonight for our second trip in the past three weeks."
"1","Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing."
"1","really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/\nWish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money, just threw that food in the trash, didn't even want my dog to eat it."
"2","I came in here with my neighbor! I ordered the steak and cheese and he ordered the meatball sub. Not only was our order fast, it was SO good. The elderly woman was as sweet as could be & the young man that brought us our food was cheerful. I love the Celtic photos on the wall, and the amount of people that draw on the wooden seats provide a homey, childhood-esque feel to the place. \n\nGood food, good service & good atmosphere. You can't go wrong."
"1","food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross..."
"2","I have been eating here since I was a little girl, and it is always the same!  It is friendly, simple, and delicious!  The sub bread is so good and the crinkle fries are awesome too.  Don't expect fancy, but do expect a good lunch."
"1","Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs, Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up.  Hour later I called, got brash woman (owner!) Who told me it was my mistake~  I asked if they would deliver, but hoped for a fresh pie~  whoa  - absolutely not!  \nWhen I asked how we could compromise,  she said she was deleting the order. Well ok I guess.\nI even called back to speak with manager (that's how I figured out she was owner)  and she absolutely didn't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.\n\nSad for them, she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not very successful~  and I'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities don't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza, pretty pathetic huh?\nKelly.  Mt Holly, NC"
"1","Have been here on 2 different occasions with my family. Both times I was disappointed. \nA bowling alley should be a fun atmosphere. There was nothing, no music playing so I went to the desk & asked if they could play some music. The guy said yea. \nNow mind you, there was nobody  waiting to pay, check in. Not busy at all. \n\n15 long minutes later I hear some soft sounds. After another 5 minutes hoping they'd turn it up, I go to the desk AGAIN & ask if they could turn it up so we could hear it over the sounds of bowling. \nThe guy looked like it irritated him but agreed. The place sounded like a morgue! \nIt's just not a place I associate with fun at all which is NOT what it should be. \n\nThe balls kept hanging up in our 2nd visit which was rather irritating bc it was one after the other. Finally they changed our lane but NO REAL give two hoots  customer service. I WILL NOT SEE IF THE 3rd TIME IS THE CHARM. \nThe food is better than the customer service, although when a lil busy it's very unorganized & long wait for even sodas."
"1","I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but I love bowling & it'd be nice not to have to travel to Gastonia or Charlotte to bowl. There must be a reason this place is always empty... even with its dirt cheap prices. With that said, I went once a few years ago and vowed never to go back. \n\nThe floors are so oily, I slipped or fell on my walk up every single time!!! I wasn't able to find the 6 lb. ball within the already limited selection. Food is limited and all fried, that's not a good thing either. I couldn't wait to leave, I remember thinking: this place is trying to kill me.\n\nPlease just increase your prices and invest in some upgrades."
"1","My biggest complaint deals with packages coming into the facility from private carriers like FedEx. If you've ordered a package and this happens, expect to wait about a week for them to deliver the package. Two day shipping turns into a week and a half. \n\nLong, long wait in lines. No concern for your packages. Terrible delivery - drivers have crammed packages into my box causing damage. If you can afford to, go with UPS."
"1","This has to be the worst company in the world..how are they still in business..customer services like Dealing with a zoo.. Nobody takes responsibility for anything.. Please therefore  do not ship any package USPO.. And why as a public are we worrying about them privatising the mail.. Remember public word-of-mouth is everything I was I would have known about the services before hand .. Now I know & will be speeding  the world to everyone I know. To avoid using the post office by all means.. Pay your bills online they offer fee money orders @ some money cash place. I hope this help someone before it's two late for them"
"2","I know its a chain, I also know its not authenic Mexican food, but every now and again I get a Taco Bell craving I just have to satisfy!\nPlus if you make some wise menu choices, you can eat good without ingesting a whole lot of fat grams. For example, I get 2 steak soft tacos fresco style which is pico de gallo instead of cheese and sour cream. The pico is very good and you can taste the fresh cilantro. This drops the fats grams to only 4 each. Add a side of rice (only 3 fat grams)  cover in fire sauce and add an unsweet tea or diet coke and you eatin' good for only 11 grams of fat! Pretty good from a fast food joint, huh? I also get a side of guacamole that really good, but I don't count it as it has it has all the good kinds of fats that are good for you! A win win situation.\nI aslo thinks its pretty damn tasty! Thats right, I said it, I LIKE TACO BELL!!\nPlus most locations I have been in are clean and the counter service is friendly.\nI don't eat here once a week or even once a month, but when the craving does hit, I'm  thinking outside the box and making a run for the border!"
"1","I'm a big fan of mc d's but I was expecting more when I saw pork chop biscuit what a fail."
"1","12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.\n\n1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less."
"1","Having people that don't speak English very well taking orders in the drive thru is a recipe for failure.  I always try to double check but feel rushed because of the amount of people behind me. My order is right 50% of the time."
"1","Worst McDonalds in the United States of America. I could get food faster in a prison cell. You have a better chance of the Pope going to hell than getting good service here."
"1","Most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me. They get the job done but sometimes they are slow or the bathroom is rank or the fries are soggy or something. \n\nThis McDonald's is by far the worst fast food experience I've ever had. They had about 3-5 employees working at around 12 am on a Saturday night. There were about 15 of us in line and it took over an hour to get our food...... An hour for \""fast\"" food. I could have went into an ihop and had two sit down meals during that time frame and filled up gas. \n\nThe employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster. Didn't feel like they spoke English well and an overall sense of indifference towards the customers. I would avoid this McDonald's at all costs, a below mediocre McDonald's with probably terrible management allowing the employees to be so apathetic and worried only about getting their hours in. \n\nAVOID!!"
"2","Great place to shoot a rifle or gun.  Pro shop is small, but staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They also offer specials on gun packages that other places do not offer, but you have to visit to see what is on special as they are not advertised.\n\nOffer gun range memberships which can be more economical than the hourly rates for those who shoot at least once a month.  Membership includes free gun rental which allows the customer to 'try out' a variety of guns before making any purchase.  AMMO is expensive everywhere, and that is not an exception here.  $30 for one box of 9mm range ammo, but much cheaper for 22 ammo.  Ammo availability has not been an issue here.\n\nClasses are offered for guns and women's self defense(no gun).  A great service to the public.\n\nThere is only one restroom and it is not nice.  Bring a toilet cover and your own wipes."
"1","Eek... avoid! We walked into Shooters Express Gun Shop looking to pop off a few rounds. The range is in the back of the shop, ensuring that you walk through the retail portion. There are two separate ranges, one for rifles/shotguns and one for handguns. \n\nWe checked in with the range master and he asked if it we had safety cards. We didn't, as this was our first visit. He handed us a business card sized safety card and told us to fill in the info (name & birthday). That was it. I'm not sure what video the others are referring to, as we didn't watch it. \n\nThe range itself had terrible ventilation. No air conditioning/cooling just a fan that didn't oscillate. Sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun. No bueno. The lighting was poor. \n\nMy biggest complaint is pricing. $18 per hour per PERSON... with an one hour minimum. Most indoor ranges charge by lane, not person. Plus... they charge for targets... Customer service was poor and unfriendly. $40 for two people to shoot for less than 30 minutes (we brought our own guns & ammo, otherwise that figure would be way higher). \n\nThe bathroom was gross. With how much money they are making at the range, you would figure they could at least spruce up the bathroom a bit. I've been to a fair share of indoor shooting ranges across the country and this was by far the least impressive!"
"2","Shooters express is my local gun range. The range staff is knowledgeable and willing to help if you have a malfunction or an issue. \nI like that they have monthly range packages available. Instead of only charging by the hour for about $40 a month you can go and shoot as much as you want with free range time so I have to pay for targets.  You have to bring your own ammunition of course or buy theirs.  \nTheir pro shop staff is honest about the quality of the firearms I tell them what I'm planing on using it for, self-defense, hunting small game and they trying to recommend something that might be useful to me even if it is less expensive than the item I was looking at at first."
"1","It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu, food pictures, employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.\n\nFor the first time since moving to the Belmont area, i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the Bi-Lo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try. \n\nWe were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout, it may have been 3 stars because the food wasn't too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken, although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets. \n\nSurprisingly they didn't overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a self-serve tea station. \n\nWhile we were eating, we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food. \n\nIf you're desperate for Chinese, get it to go."
"1","Here for trivia night on Tuesday night. Love me some Christina but they are way under staffed. It took almost an hour to get out food. Good food but this is ridiculous.  We had to go to the bar to order drinks. They need to get some help in here or people will stop coming!"
"2","Service has improved and the food is good"
"1","I'm not one to complain, and I am not a picky eater, but that was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had. For eggs Benedict that came out over 30 minutes after ordering it, I would've expected it to at least be edible. The hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it. The only decent part of the meal was the potatoes, which were just roasted with salt and pepper. Definitely will not be returning for food."
"1","Just had the worst experience at a nail salon. A older male nail technician did my nails and i usually get the pink and white fill. He needs another class with filling in the white part and an attitude adjustment.  See pic.  I told him I didn't like it he said I was picky and they looked better than what I came in with. What???? Really I said. Ok. He said it's not gonna be perfect cause it's not a full set. Smh. I had just the white done and both at the same time from my regular nail technician can't wait till she's off maternity leave so disappointed. Tips on other places I can go hit me up! Two stars for bad attitude and he knew it was bad he told me I didn't have to pay full price. So I didn't pay for the white. Still just messed up. If u go there don let him do your pink n white he probably good at other things just not that."
"1","Absolute worst experience at a nail salon. My friend & I went to get our nails done, where the older man that worked there did mine. He had a very bad attitude & when I asked him to fix the shaping of my nails, he got mad and got nasty. My acrylics now look like crap, and i have cuts on my cuticles. My friend's nails looked like a 5 year old did them. Horrible paint job, shaping & when we went to go pay, the lady who did her nails over charged her by $15.00. We then had to go back in, so she could get her money back. Never going there again."
"2","Best nail salon ever!! They always do a great job and the prices are very affordable. Everyone is always very nice and want to make sure that you are satisfed. I wouldn't go anywhere else."
"2","Great location.  Kids really enjoy all the activities."
"2","I swim at this facility several times a week. There is a very small 25 yard warm water pool that is used primarily for swimming lessons, physical therapy, & recreation.  The competition pool configuration changes between 50 meters and 25 yards, depending on the day and time. \n\nWhile I swim in many pools, the HFFA 50 meter pool tends to be one of the cooler (temp wise) practice pools in the Charlotte area. 78 - 79 is an ideal temp for me. This pool often feels cooler than that. On one occasion, our coach even had us swim in the warm & cloudy 25 yard pool bc this pool was so cold.\n\nThe facility is older, but if you are a swimmer this is a great place and will definitely meet your needs. If you are in need of any equipment, just stop by the Carolina Swim Shop located inside HFFA. \n\nBe aware that many local high schools & MAC practice here in the evening and the place gets crowded, especially the parking lot.\n\nThe women's locker room is nothing to write home about, but it does have individual shower stalls with curtains and a couple of hair dryers. Children 3 and older are not allowed in the opposite gender's locker room. Moms & dads be aware that the few individual family locker rooms fill up very quickly when swim school is in session. You may have to stand with your shivering child in the cold hallway while you wait your turn. It would be great if they had men's and women's large family locker rooms rather that single rooms.\n\nMy four stat rating is based primarily on the pools. It is the only fitness facility in the Lake Norman area, that I am aware of, with a 50 meter pool. While it is worn from usage and the locker rooms aren't the greatest, I like having access to a long course pool. I really wish this facility also had a steam room."
"1","As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition ."
"2","I hiked here with my dog the other day and fell in love. It's true what they say about the horses though, you have to be careful where you walk! We hiked through there for about an hour taking our time and never came across anyone riding horses and barely came across people. We were there super early though so that may have been the reason. Now that I have discovered this park I will be here all the time, a great place to get away from the 'city'."
"2","Great place for hiking - the trails are pretty clear and there are lots of them! Only wish there were bathroom facilities near the entrance to the trails. Also, the raptor center is pretty cool - took my son a couple of years ago and will be taking him again this year now that he's a little older. Other than that, haven't really done any of the tours or horseback riding, but a great place for an outing with the kids!"
"2","I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times."
"2","Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it"
"2","My daughter first took horseback riding lessons here over 15 years ago. We found it to be a solid and affordable place for her as a beginner. The instructor that she had at the time was very patient and kind to kids as well as the horses.  He was able to teach her all the basics and gave her a good foundation for her later training. \n\nLater on, we ended up moving to a stable much closer to home that offered more challenges for her as well as more opportunities for competition -especially in the hunter-jumper arena. \n\nHowever, we have have been back to Latta many times for her to compete in dressage shows and have also come back for trail rides. \n\nIf you are interested in a trail ride or beginner lessons, they have some really gentle horses.  The facilities are nice for horse and rider alike."
"2","HISTORIC LATTA PLANTATION\nCome check out this historica plantation if you're into old history about how farm life and slavery was back in the days in North Carolina. Small quaint houses and animals adorn this quiet farmstead. Luckily for me, today, there was a WWII reenactment happening this weekend.\n\nOn the night of July 9th, 1943, the Allied invasion of Sicily , codenamed Operation Husky, commenced. This proved to be a very important WWII campaign which incorporated both amphibious and airborne operations. The Battle For Sicily consisted of 6 hard weeks of land combat pushing the Axis Army into Italy. This kicked off the Italian Campaign which would last until the end of the war in Europe. The Allied Army was made up of soldiers from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Newfoundland, and the Free French - a total of 160,000 personnel. The Axis Army was made up of soldiers fro Italy and Germany - a total of 290,000 personnel.\n\nHere, in this reenactment, German soldiers take over a plantation and battle both US and British armed forces, where they are defeated when they get attacked on both sides. Even with a German halftrack, the battle is lost for the Germans!"
"2","Took the guided house tour on a Friday morning. The four of us were the only people taking the tour, which was really nice because we had all of our questions answered and were able to spend a good bit of time in the main Latta house. The grounds are really beautiful and after your house tour you can walk around and see the animals and smaller houses on the plantation. This is definitely a must for anyone from Charlotte or visiting Charlotte."
"2","Looking for something fun to do with the whole family or a group of friends?  Do you enjoy a challenge?  \n\nEvery fall, Rural Hill Farm offers the \""Amazing Maize Maze,\"" a challenging corn maze where you collect clues to find your way out!  We went last year for the first time and are going again this year.  \n\nLast year, there was a drought in NC so their corn maze was only about waist high in some spots.  We thought it would be easy and a good \""starter.\""  Um...no.  We soon discovered that even if you can see where you need to get to...you still don't know how to get there.  It was quite challenging, we were there for a few hours, got lost, but finally found all the clues, worked out the puzzle, and found our way out of the maze.  With more normal rain levels, this year promises to be even more challenging...and we're ready for it!  (I think)\n\nOh...and they have a pumpkin patch and hayrides.  If we find our way out this year, maybe we'll give 'em a try!  And for those of you who REALLY like a challenge, try the farm's Flashlight Maze at night.  And let me know how it was by the time you come out around February!"
"1","My boyfriend and I were excited to try out the amazing maize maze on a sunday afternoon. We were disappointed. It costs $10.00 per person and for the price, didn't really impress us. There are loud speakers all over the maze and the person on the other end of the speaker was loud and distracting. Sprinkled between the woman's loud voice on the speakers was the same country song playing over and over again. It took us 55 minutes to get through the maze and by the end, we both had headaches from the loud speaker noise. Not worth the money :/"
"2","This is an amazing way to spend a fall afternoon. You will get your daily dose of exercise and more. My preteen daughter who normally only likes to brood in her room even enjoyed it. Great thing to do with your middle school aged kids. There were quite a few people there toting toddler age kids around on their backs. I thought they must have been crazy. Last place I would want to be is stuck in a maze with a cranky 2 year old. \n\nIt took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to get out and we promptly rewarded ourselves with some fried oreos from the food tent outside the maze. There are other things to do such as a hayride and corn hole. Plus they have soccer goals set up. Will be returning next year!"
"2","Wow! Talk about true to it's name - this place lives up to it!! Amazing. Maize. Maze.\n\nIt's located out in the middle of nowhere - but thats where you're suppose to get lost right?!?\n\nThe maze is huge!! They show you an overall map at the beginning and then give you a blank one with numbered squares. You have to go throughout the maze and find the numbered mailboxes, which inside, a square piece of the map that you are trying to put together to find your way out. You get a huge flag to carry through with you, so if you need help the staff can locate you quickly.  \n\nIt's fun for about an hour - then you become crazed and really just want to get out. The end was pretty challenging and it took us about an hour & a half to complete it - we did get all the numbered map squares/pieces. \n\n\n*Best tip about this place: Follow the water marks.... (They have jugs of water in the maze for when people get thirsty - they place them at specific locations where there are maze helpers who can answer questions and assist you in finding your way. Follow the water marks on the ground to wear they carried the coolers to and you'll find help)"
"2","The GF and I have done this for the last 2 years and love it.  We've gone for the night maze both times and had a blast.  It is NOT an easy thing to get through, so be prepared to be patient.  You will go through the same area multiple times completely by accident, but you'll eventually figure it out.  This is definitely something that will continue being an annual tradition for us.  Nothing better than getting lost in a cornfield for an hour or 2 on a crisp autumn night."
"2","I suppose I'm biased because I've always loved raptors, owls particularly.  But I very much enjoyed seeing the owls, vultures, hawks, falcons, eagles, kestrels, and lively visiting corvidae (ravens, crows and magpies).  These are probably the chillest raptors you'll ever see.  I guess it'd kind of be like visiting an outdoor rehab center for permanently injured athletes.  These birds were once the rulers of the sky, swooping down on irritating prey like rats and skunks in the blink of an eye... until some sad tragedy, a bullet, a car moving too quickly - cut short their majestic reign.  So these raptors, for the most part fairly acclimated to human presence, will merely eyeball you as you walk by their aviaries or embarrass yourself by clicking and hooting to get their attention.\nStop in for the mini-lecture for an up close view of some of the birds, as well as some interesting background information."
"2","*disclaimer up front*\nI am a transport volunteer for the injured raptors coming into this facility. Most of my \""deliveries\"" get euthanized because of the severity of their injuries... and I see this place as the single best way to educate John Q. Public about why these birds die needlessly every day. \nBefore I became a transporter, I visited here at the urging of friends... and, friend, I was hooked. This is one of the best, intelligent displays/educational interactions of birds of prey I have ever seen. I bring my friends and family here whenever they visit because it is that cool, and that important. I even have a friend who also became a volunteer here after visiting."
"2","Although I'm scared of bird (I suffered a vicious peacock attack as a child (seriously)), this place was pretty cool.\n\nWe just happened to arrive as one a raptor presentation was beginning.  Seeing a presentation is a must (the trip would have not been as good without it).  The woman doing the presentation brought out a number of birds and told us lots of interesting info about them.\n\nAfter that, we just walked around to the different cages and checked out the other birds.  If you want to take pictures, bring a camera with a zoom lens (I couldn't get close enough for my iPhone pictures to be very good)."
"2","We are new to the area but really enjoyed our first season w/Strikers.  Super nice office staff & they really seem to love the game & encourage the kids to Have fun & enjoy the game.  The format is slightly different...more like an indoor set up w/the walls but it makes for a faster/always moving game & helps to improve skills at a faster pace."
"1","I brought my dog to Dr Arnold for a initial exam for a torn CCL and to ensure he was ready for surgery. During the visit, Dr. Arnold agreed that it was a torn CCL and then we discussed which surgery to do. We agreed on a surgery and set a date for 3 days after the initial exam. I dropped my dog off at the hospital for his surgery and received a phone call about an hour later from Dr. Arnold. Basically, my dog has an infection and he recommended waiting to do the surgery until the infection was gone. I agreed with him but then was shocked with a $400 vet bill when I picked him up. I felt cheated because I thought the infection should have been something discovered in the initial exam to say he was ready for his surgery. I felt like I should get refunded the money which was only $132 after I was going to spend $3500 total. There reasoning was that it was only a consultation so the doctor didn't really put his hands on him to check him out. My argument to that is that if it is the first time you have ever seen a dog wouldn't you want to check him out thoroughly to make sure there will not be any complications during the surgery. They did agree to refund $40 of the $132 that I felt that they owed me. I have total confidence in Dr Arnold but will not use their services again due to the way they conduct business. There are plenty of great vets around that due surgery. Try somebody else."
"1","Beware of this place. We had a mini-dachshund that had a bleeding ulcer. Test after test after test they were still not sure what was wrong with this young 7 year old dog. Ultimately after about $3400 worth of tests they wanted to operate to see if there was something that they were missing. How much? Another $5000. Unfortunately he had already lost too much blood, so surgery was definitely too risky and they knew that. We would up bringing our pup to another vet for a second opinion and the fix was not as invasive or expensive as CVS. Please bring your animal somewhere else! They will make you go broke and play on your feelings. Very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners. To add to this, we have had other friends and family members that have had similar experiences. So yourself and you pet a favor and don't go to these \""specialists\""."
"2","Excellent, full service dry cleaning & alterations  Have been using them for the past six years and have nothing but accolades for them.  If you live in the Stallings area, you should be using them."
"1","On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses, pants, etc but they charged me for the items. Not happy. I've decided that im not coming back to this place."
"2","Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!\n\nI'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel!"
"1","This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over."
"2","First time trying NY Pizza Express tonight, and I am very glad I did! \nFound a menu online to have a look at prices, very reasonable, actually I was surprised at how cheap they were. We order 2 large pies, one just mozz, the other sausage & bacon, for delivery on a Saturday evening. They gave us a 30-40 min time estimate, and were in my driveway no more than 20 minutes later! Good friendly service both on the phone, and from the delivery driver. \nPizza was great, nice slightly chewy crust, thin, but  not too thin. Good amount of sauce, and cheese tasted very fresh! It was really good. Super happy to have tried this place, now I just need to try their subs, calzones, and everything else! \nThanks NY Pizza Express!"
"2","My family actually prefers this place to other pizza places in the area - or did before they stopped serving the onion rings! This place had some of the best onion rings, but mysteriously, they stopped serving them! \n\nThe pizza here is a lot like NJ/NY pizza. Cheesy with a crisp/bendy crust. The pizza really is very good. The mozzarella sticks are great also. \nPlease bring back the onion rings guys!! The meatball and chicken parm. sandwiches are VERY good. Great bread too.( the meatball sub could use a few more meatballs but is still delicious)\n\nWe still love ya and will order from you often!"
"2","They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\"" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again."
"1","I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked, after eating the first slice we decided to bake it for another five minutes.\n\nOnce reheated the crust wasn't bad, not soggy or cardboard like but way thick for an alleged NY pizza. The topping unfortunately didn't get any worse or better for it, it was as solid as it was bland.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than just one is that I suspect their plain pizza is better than average for this forsaken area. \n\nYou've been warned: in Matthews-Stallings 5 stars amounts to just average out on in the modern world, and 4 stars here translates to \""it's pretty much crap but we have no better\"" ."
"2","Very good pizza!  This is usually our \""go to\"" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut) .  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side."
"1","If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru, while you are the ONLY person there.....drop in on this hole in the wall.  It is possible!"
"1","This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty), service is slow, and the ice maker makes a weird slurping sound....like someones in there. This place has such a lousy reputation that the line around the half gas station McDonalds can be wrapped around twice and no one will wait at Burger King. King Nasty!"
"1","Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough, the sausage smelled of animal decay.\n\nJust awful."
"1","UGH.\n\nNasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. \n\nSometimes when you have kids, you have to eat somewhere to appease them. I used to only go to BK if I was \""stopped up\"" and needed a release. Well, that's still definitely the case after eating there Friday night since I made intimate friends with my commode both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThis place is filthy. \n\nThe food is atrocious.\n\nThe employees are miserable (one of the cooks....No. the ONE cook was dressed in street clothes-whatever happened to uniforms?).\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"2","I'm a car guy and I can spot a fellow car guy and that folks at Tullock are car guys. This family-owned shop is friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly honest. It's easy for mechanics to take advantage of customers that wouldn't know better. These guys don't do that at all. Plus, if you're info older and classic cars, they can do a restoration too. If you're looking for an honest mechanic to help your car last that much longer (as we all are), give Todd a call"
"2","I was in Charlotte visiting family over Spring Break when my engine started misfiring.  It was Good Friday afternoon and I was planning to drive back to Chicago the following day. All the auto shops were going to be closed for the holiday weekend, so I knew I had to get it taken care of that day.  I called and spoke to Todd, who told me it might be a bigger job than they had time for, but told me to bring it right over and he'd see what he could do. \nI'm SO glad I brought it there.  Three men worked together to quickly diagnose the problem, go get the part I needed, WASHED the car while they were waiting for the part (just to be nice!!) and solved my problem in about an hour.  The price they charged me was much less than I expected, and I can honestly say it was the BEST car repair experience I have ever had.\nPlease take your car to these guys with confidence.  There's just no way you'll regret it."
"2","When my girlfriend and I moved from NY we had to find someone reliable and trustworthy to work on our vehicles.  Tullock automotive has not disappointed us.  \n\nTodd, his wife and the rest of his staff have been our go to for anything automotive while we have lived here.  Their flexibility, honesty and friendliness are why we keep coming back.  \n\nIf you live in the area or not they are worth the drive to check them out.  You will not be disappointed in the service.  Tullock automotive is a great local business in Stallings.  If you have vehicle issues do not hesitate to give them a call."
"2","I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina!"
"2","Todd is a great mechanic good person! His wife was so very nice I have told a lot of people about this place just because of his character! Thank you todd so very much as soon as I get my new hot rod its your to fix!"
"1","When my car was down and out and I was trying to decide to fix it or junk it, I took it Matthews Imports for a second opinion.  On the phone, it was \""sure, we'll check it out\"" and that remark cost me the fee for him to hook it up to his scanner machine.\n\nDude, I knew the transmission was bad...the car tells you that.  \n\nThey did follow up with a couple of options that were slightly less than my normal mechanic but unfortunately, it wasn't what I wanted.  Still I could have gotten over it but the straw that broke the camel's back was when I got into the car, went to close the OBD port and the knee pad was covered in grease.  YUCK!  \n\nThey couldn't be nicer people but not for me.  Sorry."
"2","This review is long overdue, my apologies to Gary & staff.\n\nThey first worked on my 96 Infiniti I30 about 5-years ago and I have done business with them on a few other occasions when needed.  Each time they have been less expensive but not of lower quality and certainly more of a straight-shooting, above the table approach.  I have not been dissatisfied, even when I returned with a concern of the work they had performed, they've made it right each time.  I've taken three vehicles to them over the years, the '96 I30, a '97 Camry, and an '06 Sienna.  I have been thoroughly pleased with economics (by comparison) and quality each time."
"1","Zero stars really but that is not an option. After several failed attempts at other dealers i decided to give this place a try to fix some front end noise and shaking on my toyota avalon. First time and 600 dollars later i got new brakes and rotors. Left with car and still had noise and shaking. Called back and Gary the owner told me to return next day. Then it was the drive train and bearings so 2 days and another 1100 dollars later i pick up my car. Low and behold still shaking and return yet again for a 3 rd time and its another thing. Now im 1700 in and almost 3 weeks dealing with this and car still not fixed. So for the 4 th time i called and at this point i just wanted some of my money back. I did not feel it was working out nor should i have to keep returning for the fourth time with the same initial problem. As i tried to explain this is when Gary the owner became hostile and not responsive to my request.  I don't at all see how 2 weeks 3 return trips and 1700 bucks later and you have an attitude with Me? I don't recommend yes they seem nice until you have a problem BEWARE DONT FALL FOR IT"
"2","Atmosphere aside, the food here was good. Particularly the general tso chicken. It was crispy not soggy like some places. It looks like your typical take out chinese joint so our expectations were not high to begin with but we enjoyed the food and would definitely go back."
"1","Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back"
"1","Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste."
"1","It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again."
"1","Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again."
"2","Well for this being my first stay here with my family and pet. I must say the front desk crew and management are amazing.(Todd & Melissa) Very professional and friendly and helped make our stay a good one."
"2","From start to finish, the staff and quality of work of McClintock Heating and Cooling was superb.  I highly recommend them, and will rely on them the next time I need a mechanical contractor.\n\nI hired them to run a gas line from an existing meter, up an exterior wall, across the attic, and down to a new gas hookup in the kitchen.  Everything they put in looked great, and the workers did a very good job of being minimally invasive.  I had to do very little patching of my exterior siding, and they even managed to avoid damaging my interior walls.  I was prepared to have to spend a lot of time afterwards patching holes, but I hardly had to do anything.  \n\nAlso, everyone on the staff I talked with was very professional and competent.  The workers themselves, the ladies in the office, and every supervisor I encountered was very communicative, and did a very good job of answering my questions and keeping me informed as the job proceeded.  They were even sure to have a supervisor here when the county inspector came by to help answer any questions she may have.\n\nLastly, I always get several bids when I hire work done on my house, and McClintock's pricing was very competitive.  It was near the bottom of the different bids I received, but their apparent competence and great communication from the get-go made the small price difference more than worth it.   They also accepted payment over the phone and didn't expect any payment until the job was completed and passed inspection."
"2","So far, have only needed their services for bi-annual preventive maintenance/routine checkup but they have been very pleasant to work with."
"1","(Occurred last summer, just now updating)\n\nFound myself with very simple issue on a ~6-year old unit - exhaust fan (outside) failed.  Very disappointed in response I received from McLintock when I contacted them seeking to purchase replacement fan and install myself.  The representative insisted on $90 service call to determine issue.  Them stood behind some policy that they couldn't sell parts.  I understand to a degree but they've lost a customer due to their insistence on making a buck and lack of willingness to help or direction to solve my issue.  This highlighted how they've tried to upsell me on every visit for the past couple years - I overlooked previously because I have no issue saying 'No.'\n\nI wound up finding a replacement fan online, thru a willing merchant; installed myself and all is well for a year now."
"2","Everything was great except that the water in the shower WOULD NOT heat up, ever, rendering it unusable. I ended up taking a sponge bath with the aid of the sink. \nTo be fair we didn't tell the staff because it was late at night and weren't too keen on switching rooms or having some maintenance guy come up."
"1","\""Not quite what I expected... not quite WHERE I expected either...\""\nReviewed July 24, 2011\n4 people found this review helpful\nI have to agree with another reviewer in that I am not sure how this hotel qualifies as an airport hotel.\n\nI booked this hotel stay for a business (military) event. We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\n\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \n\nThe front desk clerk seemed \""oh-so enthused\"" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\n\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\n\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\n\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\n\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\n\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \""airport\"".\n\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \n\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \n\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\n\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\n\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \""Deborah\"" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\n\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"
"1","We traveled to Mt. Holly to attend a death in the family. Luckily I knew where the hotel was located or I would have driven right past the entrance. The parking situation is horrible. The parking layout is poorly designed and I spent far too much time waiting on other guests to park or drive past. The lady at reception did not greet us when we walked up to the front desk. I am an IHC Gold Elite member. The usual offer of bottled water was an after thought and she only offered a single bottle for two guests. There was no hair dryer in the room and when I called the front desk the lady responded as though I was lying. After a few minutes later a member of the housekeeping staff came to my room. She did not greet me as i opened the door. She came in and looked around the room as though I didn't think to look around for the hair dryer before calling the front desk. She did, however, return quickly with a hair dryer. Most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude. The breakfast area was incredibly crowded. The morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door. I opened the door and it was lying in the hallway with my personal information there for anyone interested in reading my bill."
"2","Great food! awesome Margaritas!"
"2","Great Mexican at a great price. Margaritas are awesome too. Servers are polite and service is quick. This is our go-to place for Mexican around the gaston county area."
"2","If you crave a little nostalgia, Brightstar Drive-In is a throwback to a simpler, more neighborly time. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple: The LottaBurger that made them famous, pizza, onion rings, tater tots and the like.\n\nWhat I love about Brightstar, though, is the escape it provides from chain restaurants and Charlotte's \""Fisher Price\"" design. Tucked in a quiet wooded lot in Mt. Holly, the place reminds me of burger joints I visited near my grandparents' camp in New York's southern tier as a kid.\n\nGrab a deck of cards, a few friends, and head out to Brightstar for an evening. It's not too far from the Belmont Drive-In Theatre, so you could make a true throw-back experience out of it."
"1","went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.\nwe got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. \nthe bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. \n\nSAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99, you get maybe two handfuls of their fries with two small spoons of unidentifiable meat (pork? beef?!) and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station. \n\nthey do have their own radio station with great music, and fun books to read while you wait. regrettably the food was just not what we were expecting, and it is such a shame."
"2","Salad bar was simple but delicious. The lotta burger was a must try! The salad bar also came with fresh pizza. Super nice staff and nostalgic feel made this a great treat after our mega jump!"
"2","It's like Happy Days, without Richie and The Fonz. Great burgers, great fries, and diet sundrop on tap. No place else like it. Oh, and a radio station broadcasting 50's and 60's hits from the diner too. If you're lucky, they'll play a request for you. Love this place when i'm in Mt. Holly or Belmont."
"2","For japanese fast food, I love it. I can run in, order, head out pretty quick. The staff is friendly. If you want to eat the place has always been really clean. I just wished they deliveried!  :))"
"1","Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland."
"1","It's MCDONALDS! You wanted a review.. Ok keep your panties on... here it is...\n\nThe place is always slammed (yay for fast food).. You think going into a drive-thru is fast.. It's not. Make sure you check your order as it often comes back wrong - the place is run by 16-19 year olds I swear to god. \n\nIt's a clean place. Well there's something.. It's fast food so you don't have to cook - although I don't know why I'm saying fast in anything because they are not here.. Lastly, it's on the way through Mt. Holly on the way to 85. \n\nAnd that's your 20 second review.. I warned ya."
"1","Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago, this place has gone from bad to worse. Every order is wrong. The problem exists at both the ordering process in the drive through, but also in the order picking by staff even if the order was right. How sad. This is the worst McDonald's and worst customer service of any restaurant in any category. Here's what to expect:\n\nLong lines\nRude customer service that claim its the customer's fault\nIncorrect orders every time\nCold fries\n\nThis is one of the restaurants I worry about that spits in food that retaliate insteed of fixing problems. They have added convenient waiting stations for your car to park so that they can hopefully match the order with the car. Too bad even then the orders are not right. What's worse? Nothing changes even when they aren't busy. \n\nAvoid this location."
"1","This hotel was ok, the Host -Quntin was great., the room took a while to heat up. and the food was good and alot ( dinner). the cheapest thing on the menu was $12.00. The room was wonderful other then the heat part. When it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad. bacon was cooked to hard, the eggs were hard, the fruit was the only thing they could not mess up. that cost me $15.00 (not happy) I went here because my flight got bumped and the next flight was not until the next day. ( not happy). When i went to the bar for dinner they had hockey on and i ask could they change the channel to CNN OR SOMETHING else the guy said no !! all 6 of the tv had to stay on that channel it was a wiring problem."
"1","Lobby, restaurant, bar and internet area all look great and new! Room Service was great, fast and efficient. Check in was good, not great! They charge for internet service in the room, that's so 2008!\n\nThis is a typical 80 style building that was retrofitted and remodeled. So The main structure, bathroom and HVAC systems all pose a ongoing problem, no matter the extensive renovation.\n\nFrom a cleanliness perspective the room had spider webs around every corner of the ceiling."
"1","I get really annoyed with these \""fancy\"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  \n\nAlso, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThere's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.\n\nThe room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in."
"1","This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.\n\nI'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!"
"2","Updated:  12/17/12\n\nThe Good:  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The front desk was very friendly (Lindsay at the front desk has been particularly friendly and helpful) at check-in and the restaurant staff were also very nice.  The room was clean and well kept with a ~24\"" flat TV and decent furniture.  The breakfast  has been improved since the last time.  The potatoes were much better than before and the eggs were done on a per order basis when it wasn't busy.  The bacon and was quite a bit better.\n\nThe Not So Good:  Dinner was decent but still left a bit to be desired as far as seasoning and interesting flavors to their dishes.  They would do well to get a little more variety of beers on tap as well.  Yes it is a hotel by the airport but I've stayed at several hotels this lose to airports and they generally have better windows to isolate some of the noise.\n\nOverall, this was a good hotel.  I think the room is among the better quality ones in the area and, provided you're a sound sleeper when it comes to noise, it is pretty comfortable."
"1","The staff was friendly and helpful. That's the only reason this place gets a star. After 10 hours on the road we stumbled in here thinking, how bad can a Sheraton be? Answer: pretty bad! A huge number of kids were staying here for a soccer tournament. No one appeared to be supervising these children who ran screaming through the lobby and restaurant/bar area for entire evening. Actually they were also running and yelling in and out of elevators and hallways, too! It was a tired person's worst nightmare. The room was clean, but the carpeting was terribly stained and the furniture scratched. The bed was, thankfully, comfortable. Just to finish things off, the bill slipped under the door that night was totally wrong. I'd say, skip this one. You can surely do better!"
"1","Starwood Hotels, you really let us down. We booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in Charlotte. We arrived at the hotel via the courtesy van. While the front desk girl and shuttle guy were pleasant, that's pretty much the only thing I can say were positives of this experience. \n\nFirst, our room reeked of incense (FYI, non-smoking also includes pot smoke). Next, we went down to the lobby area to eat dinner. When we tried to order, we were told that they were \""out\"" of both items we requested. Then, the items we did order tasted like the equivalent of a Stouffer's microwave dinner and the dessert was rubbery and a waste of money.\n\nNext, in the morning, when we went to get ready, we had to bathe in our own dirt because the shower drain was clogged. I literally filled the tub with shower water that didn't go down all the way until we were almost ready to check out. That's just nasty!\n\nWhen we got downstairs my husband asked an employee if they had a kiosk to check in for our flight (many hotels have this now). He said they didn't but directed us to the business center to print our passes via their computer. He failed to mention that the printer wasn't working. So I went through the whole thing for nothing. \n\nI typically don't pay for or book hotels through full-price sites (in this case spg. com) but we wanted to make sure we were super close to the airport and up until this experience I had always had all positives to say about Starwood Hotels (owners of Sheraton, Westin, W, Four Points, etc.).  We paid about $200 for the room before taxes and fees and I won't ever do that again. I had a better stay at a Holiday Inn off Hotwire for $85!\n\n Also, once again, no free WiFi...which pretty much puts this on the no-go list!"
"1","This hotel looks a lot better than it smells. The lobby has the stench of too much cheap air fresher and the rooms, furnished in the 1970s faux wood motel style, carry the unpleasantly musty stink of the unconcealed carpet stains. \n\nMy room overlooked a dreary parking lot but on the bright side, the Internet was relatively quick and the hotel is minutes from the airport and the interstate. There are no decent food options within walking distance. \n\nCharlotte is such a nice town, this hotel and its environs won't do your trip justice. Surprised that this meets the Starwood standard."
"1","The good:  The staff in the evening at check-in were friendly and helpful.  After getting stuck in Charlotte due to weather in Chicago, we were able to book this hotel for our unexpected stay.  As a nursing mother I was hoping for a fridge in my room, however a pageant taking place at the hotel meant all were taken.  The staff were nice enough to let me keep some things in the employee fridge which I really appreciated.\n\nThe beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night's sleep.\n\nThe food at the main restaurant/bar was decent with very large portions.  In typical southern style, it was covered in sauce(s) but good enough.\n\nThe not so good:  The main picture posted on Yelp (and on SPG.com) leads you to believe the hotel is nicer than it actually is.  The hotel is very average and does not appear to have been significantly updated in the last 10-15 years (except for the beds which were quite nice).\n\nThe website advertising a 24-hour on-demand shuttle, however the on-demand part is only when being picked up from the airport not to be dropped off (which would have been helpful for them to mention at check-in).  There were 3-5 of us that were ready to go at 5:45am (because our flight departed at 6:50am) but were told that we had to wait until 6am because it only leaves on the half hour.  They also would not let us ride with an earlier van that carried crew members and informed us that a taxi would take 15-20 minutes to call.  Overall, seemed frustrating as to why they could not have a van make a trip to the airport when there are 5 people waiting to go.\n\nI'm not sure if this is an SPG systematic problem or not, but the hotel charged me for internet on my bill and I had to ask to have it taken off (since I'm a platinum member).  This has happened at several hotels, and I feel they are trying to pass through charges and hoping that guests don't notice."
"2","Staff are great - friendly and helpful. Beds are hit or miss. Some beds are noticeably  older and squeak horribly. Some are as comfy as could be. As usual, Sheraton pillows are amongst the best. Restaurant, bar, pool, and lobby are nice as well."
"1","Pretty lobby, but had problems with the hotel staff.  We held a meeting there and had no problems with the room, the AV or the catering.  However, as a guest, I would not go back.  \n\nThe lobby is pretty, but the room did have a smell to it.  \n\nThe internet connection in my room was intermittent and when I called, I was told, \""I don't know what you want me to do about it . . \""  She didn't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly, rude.  I had the same problem on my laptop, iPad and iPhone.  It wasn't me.  \n\nI asked to take a muffin from the restaurant into the meeting room and, at first, they didn't want to let me - at all.  When they did, they charged me for the full buffet.  \n\nOthers in our group had problems as well."
"2","This is my favorite Wing place, whether I go in person or have my food delivered. The owners are nice and so are those they have working with them. Even when they have forgotten something on my order during a delivery, they made sure to bring it back promptly. I think they are very accommodating."
"1","I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me \""that wasn't me, it must've somebody else. \"" When I spoke to the \""manager\"" he said they weren't delivering tonight.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  A wing place.  Not delivering.  Ok. I don't need to spend my money there."
"1","This business has been here for several years, and how its survived I'll never know. The kids that are employed here must get paid next to nothing, cause every time I get up the nerve to try them again, its a whole new crew. Each seems to sass and ignore the customers worse than the last crew did. The wings are good, and I guess its just the fact that there's no competition that they make enough to stay open. This place would kill if the staff just PRETENDED to care about customers. Example: Last time I ordered wings, I knew they would take FOREVER, so I didn't even leave my house for a while. Then when I got there, I was waiting and wanted to pay my bill so I could leave when they got ready. Couldn't do THAT!!!! Had to finish cooking them to release the ticket so she could ring it up. So, they must have waited to start them until I got there, 'cause it was well over ten minutes later when they finally came to the front. (WTF?, WHY CALL AHEAD?????) Then, she was busy helping other people that must not have been able to read a menu, or understand english, and it took several minutes more for her to get my money, so I COULD FINALLY GET MY CARCASS OUT OF THAT PLACE!!!. EVERY time I've been in this place, must be a dozen by now, its been some sort of \""Don't give a flying +++\"" attitude that just insults me to the point I don't want to come back. Presently, I have a STRONG hankering for some of their wings, but it just hasn't been long enough that I'm willing to go back."
"1","Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back."
"1","sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \""that's sick! \"" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross. \n\nAfter driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.\n\nMy noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said \""sign-this\"" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible. \n\nI should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!"
"2","I too don't understand the low ratings for this place. As others have said you've got to keep your expectations in perspective when visiting a mall food court. For a quick and tasty fast food experience I really love Sarku Japan. They do cook the food fresh to order and I usually order their Teriyaki chicken special. Their teriyaki isn't too sweet which I like and it carmelizes on the chicken for a really great flavor. Because I'm a big guy who likes to eat I get the double meat, spring roll and drink combo. All this for just over $10. In my book and palate I think this is a pretty good deal."
"2","The customer service here is amazing! I called on a Saturday with an impromptu lunch order for 18 box lunches. Lakeisha, the awesome employee that answered the phone didn't flinch when I said I needed the lunches in an hour. \n\nI arrived an hour later and everything was ready and organized. My HOA volunteers thank you and we'll be back...with more notice next time"
"2","Delicious food (hook and ladder is my favorite). They are quick.  Plenty of space to eat inside or outside. \nGREAT service!"
"2","Clean, great staff good subs, even better that it right beside Starbucks. They also now take Apple Pay."
"1","Service was terrible!! My sister and I walked in this location and were not even greeted with an hello. As we browsed through the store 2 of the sales associates went in the opposite direction when they saw us coming. On our way out of the store both associates were at the front of the store shouting goodbye. I proceeded to tell them I noticed we were intentionally being ignored, how rude they are, and that discrimination is completely wrong. I also so let them know their actions are the perfect way to get bad reviews for the store.\nMy sister and I are 2 professional women (Chemist/Psychologist) we were surprised to witness this type of treatment from furniture salesmen. But I guess when you walk into this location with the wrong skin color you get no service... 2014MLK Day... Smh"
"1","In the past when my husband and I needed to purchase good quality furniture we always went to Walter E Smith in the Chicago area.  Since living here we made the change to Ethan Allen.  We purchased a full living room from them this past spring and have been very happy with almost everything.  The service was great and the sales person listened to us and put together exactly what we wanted with one exception.  We asked for tables (specifically a coffee table) that could stand up to some abuse because we have a 16 month old at home.  The table he recommended is beautiful but does not at all stand up to what he said it would.  This table is only 3 1/2 months old and already has wood chipping off, many many dents and looks absolutely horrible.  This table is so softI can dent/scratch it with my fingernail.  Ive have better quality tables from Target and World market for 1/3 the price.  After only 2 months use I called the store to tell them the sales clerk clearly did not know the product he was selling, if he did he never would have recommended this table.  I was told they did not cover customer abuse and can't be held accountable for a sales person giving me bad information.  It's the sylvan coffee table....DO NOT BUY IT!!  I dropped the remote control on it and it left a huge dent.  They wouldn't even offer to come out to see if the table was defective or had the wrong finish.  I told them I would bring it in myself and they said no.   My end tables and cocktail table are extremely durable/well made and are exactly what I wanted.  I am disappointed the table I was most concerned about is horrible."
"1","Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!!"
"2","I mentioned to a friend that I was headed to one of the big chains (rhymes with Sprawl-Mart) to pick up some furniture for my balcony. He said I should head here instead and what a great suggestion that was. GR is a MASSIVE store with not just outdoor furniture but they also stock tons and tons of really neat stuff for indoors too. \n\nIn the lawn furniture section, I had a selection of prices colors and styles. I managed to narrow down to a neat and comfy pair of chairs with a foot rest and matching side table. All for less than a hundred bucks! What's not to love?\n\nYep, it's probably only going to last a season or two. But do I really want to pay three times as much for something that will last forever? Sorry, but my budget won't stretch that far."
"1","I bought some Halloween lights there a few weeks ago that did not work for, $3.99.  Went back to exchange them for better quality ones without my receipt, they said they could not refund.  I thought that was petty of them to not take them back.  They still got my sale for the better quality ones.  The clerk said she was sorry.  If the management was actually sorry they would have refunded my $3.99 don't you think?"
"1","Garden Ridge is not the same...it has really gone downhill.  It seems that they have bought out other stores of items that did not sell...junky items.  Every time I go in there I can never find anyone to help me and they only have one register open. Their shopping carts are all rusty and broken. I miss the old Garden Ridge."
"1","Is it me or have the prices at Garden Ridge gotten ridiculously high? I admit that I'm more of a seasonal Garden Ridge shopper - Christmas season, but thought I'd go have a look around today...really? Small pressed wood end tables for $149 - $400 for an 8x10' rug? As I looked around more, I realized that most, if not all, of what I'd want could be purchased cheaper at Wal-Mart or Target...and better quality. No wonder the store was empty. There was a sign out front saying that they're planning on revamping the store....I hope that means they'll be sharpening their pencils and cutting those prices or the next sign we'll see out front is For Lease!"
"1","Having just moved to the area with my resplendent girlfriend, one of my bloodcurdlingly saucy gentleman friends advised we hit Garden Ridge. So we did just that. After hearing of sweet deals and a wide array, of unique and tasteful items I was all about it.\n\nAs I drifted aimlessly through what seemed to an ocean of useless baubles, I thought to myself...\""Hey me, this place is way overpriced for the quality of the stuff available.\"" I totally agreed with myself and also admired how sexy my voice was, even when its just in my own head. Just when I thought all was lost...it happened.\n\nOne of the most beautiful lamps I have ever laid eyes upon. I'm not even going to tell you what it was, cause I know you will just bite my style in hopes of being super cool like me. First of all, this is no cake walk sister. Do you know what it like to be so cool that the elderly and small children freeze to death when they come within 20 feet of you? No...didn't think so. What ensued was me trying to build the most heinous lamp I possibly could, while trying not to have my girlfriend murder me. I t truly was the highlight of my garden ridge excursion. And despite her coming close to strangling me to death in front of a woman who I suspected was wearing a fright wig, and cut off sweatpant shorts, I prevailed. Ultra bad-ass night table lamp was born.\n\nA lot useless junk, that they are charging way to much for. If you have some cash to throw around and want to get a few things for your house or garden then go right ahead. You may even find a few gems here and there. But don't go in there expecting great bargains or stuff that is going to blow your doors off....aint happening Mojumbo."
"1","Very dated, small bathroom, tube TV\n\nBreakfast was good."
"1","I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. \nI started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \"" missing manual or dead battery\"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. \nI was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. \nI asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. \nI get \""as is\"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.\nNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. \nThank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.\n\nPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad"
"1","I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. \n\nA few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.\n\nI since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!\n\nI told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.\n\nThis brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.\n\nI wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area."
"1","Thank you everyone who posted reviews. Due to the information I have now researched, I will not be attending this store ever. I will be driving to another dicks location bc clearly this one seems to be one hot mess."
"1","Went for lunch today - and very upset that they now CHARGE a $3 fee for a basket of the pretzel rolls at lunch!\n\nSuggestion to the restaurant - simply ask each table if they want bread.  If they say no, you save the cost of the bread.  If they say yes, the bread is likely to be eaten.  \n\nThe charge for the bread isn't worth alienating good customers.\n\nBTW, we didn't have an inexpensive lunch.  Tab for four of us - including two glasses of wine, one beer, three after meal specialty drinks, one dessert and the aforementioned basket of rolls - was over $100.  Did the $3 bread really impact the restaurant profit margin that much?"
"2","Went back to the Waldhorn this past Sunday for brunch and had a great visit. Normally, I avoid buffets, but their brunch buffet is nice. I love the cooked-to-order omelette station as well as the selection of  traditional breakfast foods and traditional German foods.  The people are friendly, service was good and quality of the food is excellent.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try for brunch even if you are not typically a fan of \""German\"" food -- I don't eat beef, pork, cabbage, etc but I can certainly find plenty of other options here that are excellent (Sp\u00e4tzle, Chicken, French Toast, Cheese Grits, Home Fries, Fresh Vegetables, Fresh Soup of the day, and delish fresh breads).  Brunch is also an excellent time to try some of their various desserts  such as fruit cobblers,  Napoleons, Bienenstich Kuchen (Honey cake with cream in the middle and honeyed almonds on top),  Black Forest Cake, Apfelstrudel, Eclairs, and many others."
"1","Been to Germany? If not, then go. If yes, then no. When I think of German food, I think of the smells of Frankfurt Am Main or the hip little Back Factory spots around Berlin. This place lacks something, it may be Germans. I dunno. Spend 30 bucks on 8 euros worth of food. Do the math it doesn't add up."
"2","Just came back from their Sunday Brunch. It was about $15 per person unless you have kids under 4 which are free. The brunch is a great way to try a lot of items in one sitting. They have an omelet station which was decent but I came for the German food. Also at the omelet station was roast beef which was just OK. They have about 30 other lunch items on the buffet. The best part by far is the dessert section which included about 10 additional items. It was not the best German I have had but I would not expect that from a buffet. I will be back to try a menu item another day. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the building had a great German feel."
"2","Visited the Waldhorn last Friday evening in attempt to fit in the last weekend of their Oktoberfest Celebration.\n\nWhen I think of where I want to eat, German food doesn't exactly jump to the front of the line... but after going to the Waldhorn - I'm definitely a fan and to have a german restaurant in Charlotte/Pineville is a real treat.\n\nThe parking situation was a bit crazy since I guess it was the last weekend for Oktoberfest so everyone was trying to get their Waldhorn on that night (and I'm sure the night after that).  I ended up parking at the James K. Polk memorial center and walking up to the restaurant.  \n\nI had a large group of people with me from the office so getting a table took a little bit of time.  We had someone go early and put in our names for a group of 10.\n\nWhen we finally got seated, our waitress was very nice and understanding since it is sometimes hard to order with the traditional German vernacular - Lots of pointing and the waitress finishing our sentences were involved.  \n\nI had the Bratwurst Platte and enjoyed every bit of it.  There were 3 types of bratwurst on the plate along with a healthy portion of sauerkraut.  I cleaned my plate along with a LITER of Spaten Oktoberfest (amber ale) that was heaven.  The waitress kept a basket of bread/pretzel bread full and they were nice a hot out of the oven.\n\nAfter diner, we proceeded to go into the tent behind the restaurant to enjoy the German band, dancing, festivities, and more beer.  Definitely a great way to celebrate Oktoberfest!"
"1","Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.\n\nCarpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast, some if the carpaccio was cooked. Horrible.\n\nI have enjoyed the venison dish in the past...it was always tender and succlent. Last visit, it was so rare and chewey I could not enjoy it. I asked the waitress about it, and she replied, \""They've always cooked it rare\"". \n\nThe crab cakes: I know that most German menus probably don't include crab cakes! But, most nice restaurants do, so it is pretty standard fare. Their crab cakes are very crabby, but also include either tuemeric or curry, which is entirely unexpected, and does not add to the dish.\n\nTheir famous salad: The Waldhorn salad, baby greens towering over delicious cucumber salad, orzo salad, carrot salad and delicious german potato salad. This dish is just amazing! For us, it is the only reason to return to Waldhorn's!\n\nBring your own water, service is spotty most times....and I've observed that we aren't always the only ones with empty glasses!\n\nWe've liked Waldhorn for over 10 years....but this weekend was probably our last visit."
"2","Driving around Pineville at night, you're in Close Encounters - on this dark, twisty road and all of a sudden BAM the bright lights of some delicious Germanic Castle shine bright in the eyes.  \n\nInside, it's a mix - diner meets hall, flags and Spaten gear everywhere. Most importantly - this is the only place in CLT to get a full liter of delicious, German beer. 10 bucks. Reasonable. Even Erk's huge paws get dwarfed by such a stein.\n\nI figured eating here would be spatzle only - fine, I'll have more bier - but no, there's actually a sweetly-done entree to be had - veggies wrapped in puff pastry, sliced, sauced with red pepper puree that had a creamy, somehow sharp bite. $13 makes it a tad pricey, and dinner entrees climb from that. Latkes (er, whoops) were lovely - croquettes as well. Kasespatzle on the kiddie's menu rounded out our carb party and was super-enjoyable - sliced thin, like linguine, seeking a Fettucine Alfredo-style dish - I like mine more dumpling, but still satisfying.  \n\nPretzal rolls? Hot mustard? Huge booths? Great service. OMB's Dunkel on tap, along with the big hits - Franziskaner (light AND dark, huzzah), Bitte burger, Warsteiner, Weihenstephaner. \n\nWish it was closer."
"1","Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better."
"2","This place makes me feel right at home.  Warm and personable, the Waldhorn offers a cozy atmosphere to drink some quality beer on tap.  Mmmm...no skunky green-bottle taste!\n\nThe food isn't by any means anything special...it's just typical German food.  You either like it or you don't.  This guy...does!  And...what would a German restaurant be without some accordian music?  There's just something about polka that makes me want to drink more.  Hmmm?\n\nThe service is excellent, the atmosphere is warm, the food is filling, the prices are reasonable, and you'll feel like part of the family.\n\nDas Waldhorn ist ausgezeichnet!"
"2","Fairly authentic german food. Great atmosphere. Liked it more before I actually went to Europe and had actual german food. Never going to be quite the same but I still love it! Good place to go for something different and tasty!"
"2","This is one of those places I really want to LOVE for some reason!  So I was glad to go back for lunch today and get the items I liked last time and taste something new.  The service was very good last time, today it was even better.  My choice today was the \""International Hoagie\"" This was very Good an easy 4 yelp stars of: Roast Beef, Westphalian Ham, Salami, Turkey, Fleischkaese, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce and Tomato on a fantastic Pretzel Hoagie Roll.  This usually is served with Tarragon-Balsamic Mayonnaise, which I asked them to leave off.  The only other change I asked was to add onions.  This sandwich was very good!  French Fries were offered with this sandwich though I substituted the delicious \""Home Fries\"" cooked with bits of Bacon...5 yelp stars Yum!  For Dessert I had \""Schokoladenmus\"" Chocolate Mousse served with Bourbon Sauce and Fresh Fruit, it was A-OK 3 yelp stars.  The next course was five Pretzel Rolls looking great on a plate (see photos of all this if you like).  The next course, was a course of action to pay and get out before i ordered more food!  Oktoberfest here starts Friday September 23 and is for the weekends only (four weekends Fridays and Saturdays).\n\nNext time I'll be there for dinner and eat outside."
"2","Let me start by saying this. If it's lunch...\n\nORDER A PRETZEL ROLL...or maybe 3! (They're free with dinner, or at lunch they're $1.) Crunchy exterior (but not hard) sprinkled with sea salt and served with pats of butter. \n\nCan I admit, I wish I hadn't offered my husband half of mine, so I could have eaten the whole thing?  Silly Dion. \n\nBut besides that, Waldenhorn's food is authentic German, set in a comfortable, homey setting with friendly servers.  Lots of beers on tap, served by the liter and half liter. \n\nLunch is usually served until 3pm, but on Saturdays it's 4pm.  I had the special of the day, the Rindsrouladen, which is braised beef rolled with cabbage, onions, pickle and bacon.  It was served with spatzel and green beans.  \n\nI ate the entire thing!  The meat is so tender, the spatzel nice and buttery (their spatzel is more like long thin noodles, not little pellet shapes BTW) and even the green beans were nice and crisp and garlicky.  No mushy beans here! \n\nMy husband got the weinershnitzel, and it was pounded perfectly thin and uniform, crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  The fries are the thin, super crispy kind (Think BK...but better. Strange comparison, I know.) and more of those yummy crisp green beans. He too ate it all!\n\nOur server was very good at explaining each menu item to us, and didn't steer us wrong with her recommendations. She even came by to ask if we wanted more gravy...which we did, and could have sopped up 5 pretzel rolls with the stuff! \n\nPrices were reasonable.  Sandwiches about $7-$9 and the lunch entrees about $10 to $11. \n\nCan't wait to go back and try dinner (Complete with accordion player!?) or their brunch buffet. Oktoberfest is coming up too, which includes live music and festivities."
"2","Best Sunday brunch in Charlotte. Period. I could stop there, but I'll go on.\n\nGreat German beers and German delicacies on the buffet line, including sauerbraten, pork loin cooked with bacon, red cabbage, sauerkraut, you name it. The only thing I didn't see was weiner schnitzel, but maybe they have that on other Sundays? Plus of course, all the usual Sunday breakfast things - an omelette station, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, etc. And an assortment of dessert items.\n\nGreat service with a smaller-sized dining area that helps keep the meal intimate.\n\nI've not been here for a meal other than brunch, but I will absolutely do so and let you know.\n\nNote: Check their website for the Oktoberfest schedule. The place gets crazy busy and I'm not exaggerating. They have local cops here to direct traffic!"
"2","AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING BEER!!!! I love this place!\n\nBest European Food in Charlotte, besides my mother's of course...."
"2","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.\n\nSometimes there are things in life that you just can't express in words full how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate it. Or love it. This is ALMOST one of those cases, but for you fine people I will spit some lyrical truth about this epic brunch.\n\nBest roast beef in the land\nSliced by hand,\nOn your Command,\nDelish.\n\nBreakfast foods ye seek,\nMight as well get 2 plates,\nFrench toast and hashbrowns peak,\nUnder all that bacon.\n\nSausages are varied,\nMustard with them - heaven.\nSauerbraten, sauerkraut, spaitzel\nOh look, schnitzel - I'll have 7\n\nI love you Waldhorn Brunch.\nI want to spend my life with you.\nThis isn't a poem.\nBRB going for another trip (and don't skip dessert!)"
"2","Oktoberfest.  Live it.  Love it.  We've gone for my husband's birthday the past 2 years, and it has never failed to disappoint.  SO BUSY though, so book your reservations well in advance or you'll be waiting hours at the door.  The atmosphere is so fun and lively, and you wouldn't look a bit out of place in your lederhosen!  So drag it out of the closet!  I know you have a pair (a set?).  \n\nThe food is, as the other reviews say, wunderbar.  Unbelievable saurkraut.  Pretzel bites are the bomb.  Sausage sampler, exquisite.  They have a special menu for the fest, and I haven't been back to try the non-fest-fare, but it seems to me like anything you pick would be a winner.\n\nBut hands down the best part of Oktoberfest?  The accordion guy.  He is the jam.  He played the Pennsylvania Polka for us Steeler fans, and it was magical (sorry QC peeps, you won't get that, and it's okay).  Just give this guy some love because he's awesome.\n\nI'll post an update if I can ever make it back for Sunday Brunch!"
"2","The 1st time I have ever ate at this location. You really have to enjoy german food in order to appreciate some of the dishes that is server on the brunch buffet during Sundays. The food that I ate was very tasteful and I really enjoyed being there. During their sunday brunch they will also make omlets on demand with all sorts of different fillings and toppings."
"2","So I've yet to go to the Waldhorn for lunch or dinner?  Why, then, am I reviewing it, you ask?\n\nThe answer: OMG brunch buffet.\n\nOk, so at $16 and change, the weekend brunch buffet isn't cheap. But it is plentiful and delicious. Omelettes are made to order (and made well, at that), and there smorgasbord of other selections: everything from pasta to rice to sausage to cake.\n\nOf special note are the sausages and the red cabbage. Especially the red cabbage. If you think cabbage can't be so good as to give you daydreams, well, you haven't had the cabbage here. Even a brunch attendee native to Germany agreed with me on that.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive (even though we were difficult and changed tables!) and the decor is entertaining.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I haven't experienced a full-service meal here yet.  I suspect that is just a matter of time, however."
"2","Schnitzel bonanza! I came here with my family for a nice German time, plus I was craving for a schnitzel for months since I came from San Fran. Inside the ambiance is very lets say, German feeling (not that I've been to Germany... But from pictures I can imagine, right?) high ceilings and wooden support beams cover this restaurant. The wooden beams are Covered with fliers of Spaten German beer which gives a feeling of Germany party feeling.\n\nSo let's get to the food. I got schweitzer schnitzel (I believe) which is breaded pork stuffed with swiss cheese and ham. It was delicious (but I think San Fran still has it for me). Inside there was black forest ham, which gave it an extra touch of it and it oozed out Swiss cheese.\n\nOther dishes were pork tenderloin and pan fried ham of pork topped with an egg. They didn't think it was bad because it was healthy and wasn't too oily nor salty. \n\nFor dessert we ordered some ice cream with peach schnapps topped with raspberry. It was okay, the raspberry had a hint of sourness but at the same time the ice cream balanced the sour taste. It was an interesting combination.\n\nOverall, I felt pretty good about this restaurant considering its in Charlotte and one of the only German restaurants the city offers. They fulfilled my tummy and I will come here if I crave for schnitzels, maybe try another type of schnitzel next time."
"2","If you enjoy German food, then this is the absolute BEST place in the area.  They have pretzel dough rolls that are just the bomb!  Lets also not forget to mention the copious amounts of awesome imported German beer!!"
"1","Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing."
"2","If you are in the mood for German food, look no futher. This place is completely fresh! Not just because it is basically the only German restaurant in the area, but because it is also very, VERY good. \n\nFirst off, events. I really need to address this first. Their annual Oktoberfest is a must-attend! I myself had been so fortunate to attend my first year and was completely awed. We first had eaten indoors and went outside to the festival afterwards into the night. The entertainment was of real German-style lights, music, costumes, etc. Beer out in \""the tent\"" was modestly priced, and good times were had by all in our party as we took it all in. Very jam-packed, but somehow not necessarily crowded. Parking could be better. If you have the opportunity to go, do so. \n\nThe normal restaurant operation is a good amount less hectic. The atmosphere is somewhat upscale, with a lot of German decor. The food is of very high quality, and as such you pay a little more for it. The beer selection is also very good. \n\nHaven't had German food often? Want to plan out your next food choice ahead of time? See http://www.waldhorn.us/ and check out their full menu.\n\nOverall, hands down the place to be for German food. Great for dates as well as meals with friends and parties."
"2","Great food a staff that knows the food and menu. The Beer club is the best thign going in the area after a tueday at work. Close your eyes and open them quick and your in Germany. Beer selections for the real beer drinkers, go in and get a liter of some good germany brews."
"2","Absolutely five stars! Every time I come out this way to see family I make an attempt to stop in. The wait staff is always top notch, the bier is fantastic, the environment is friendly and pleasant; the food is spectacular. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"
"2","Ate here for dinner with my mom; this was our fourth time here, to which my Mom thoroughly enjoys when visiting me while I'm okay about.  \n\nIn the most recent visit I ordered for appetizer the Goulash Soup, which I found it to be much creamer than expected.  The soup though was very good overall, with chunks of meat and potatoes floating in the mix.  Mom ordered a salad, she enjoyed it.  The rolls were also very good.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Wienerschnitzel, which was okay though a bit tough.  Mom ordered the  Rouladen, which she enjoyed greatly.  Overall, my Mom enjoyed the meal and evening, more than me, which is good.  Personally, I prefer the Sunday brunch more because its a buffet that I can pick what I want.  Overall, I give it four out of five."
"2","Yep...an honest to goodness authentic German restaurant/gasthaus right here south of Charlotte.  Interior is authentic, with open wood beams, banners and other decorations and a authentic menu to boot.\n\nHaving been stationed in Germany with the Army and later in and out for business, I know that I know and this is the real thing.\n\nAbout a dozen German beers on draft (!) and a lot more bottled.  They even have a beer club.  The beer is served in crisply clean logo-ed mugs along with the traditional beer \""decken\"" or cardboard coasters.\n\nMenus for lunch and dinner with cover the waterfront.  Authentic goulash soup and a delirious cream of mushroom soup.  Their German noodles, \""spaetzel\"" are perfect, red cabbage also.  Salad greens with that light vinegar and oil dressing was superb.\n\nWiener-schnitzel was just OK to me...but it was really pork and was not tough.\n\nGreat atmosphere and food, hands down.  We will return and look forward to their annual Oktoberfest, which others say is a great, authentic occasion."
"2","This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Pretzel rolls are served with a spicy mustard on the side that is to die for.  Food and service is always on point.  They have my Husbands favorite draft beer all year round- Oktoberfest."
"2","They serve spaten Oktoberfest year round! Great brots, potato pancakes, and pretzel bread!"
"2","ALWAYS delicious! Oktoberfest is insane every year."
"2","You will feel transported to Germany (well, close enough) when you come up the drive for the quaint, authentic building.  5 yelp stars for the beer and the beer list.  The pretzel rolls that came gratis were excellent, and would have been worth an app price if served with a good beer cheese.  The  weiner schnitzel was average good.  It came on a jaeger (brown, mushroom) sauce, which is not traditional at all.  The rouladen was pretty good.  For those not in the know - rouladen is like a rolled up burger with bacon and pickles.  Pretty good!  \n\nBut - Where are the dirndls and lederhosen on the wait staff??  And no German music, no background music at all.  A small touch of ambiance, but authentic music would go a long way.  Our server was from Honduras, and wasn't familiar with German food, but he was honest about the sauerbraten being dry (true) and he was jovial and sincere.  Excellent option for German in Charlotte!  Hoping to come back for Oktoberfest in our dirndl and lederhosen!  Prost!!"
"2","We had a dinner reservation for 19 people on one of the busiest weekends of the year. The food, service and staff were excellent."
"2","My wife and I had our wedding reception here last month and we can't sing their praises enough!  They made it so easy for us so we could focus our attention on everything from actually getting married to coordinating out of town guests joining us.  The staff was helpful, good-natured, seem to be enjoying themselves as much as our guests (our reception was a little unconventional).  Oh, and did I mention the food?  The sausage combination was juicy and delicious, the veggies were crisp and delicious, the pork loin was so tender and the sauce was creamy and tangy, the salad options were all that you could expect from a fine German restaurant (make some extra room for the red cabbage especially), and of course the delicious spatzle made the meal just all we could've hoped for.  If you haven't been here yet, might I suggest checking out the Sunday brunch buffet first to get a good feel for what they have to offer.  This place will hold a special place in our hearts for taking so much stress out of our big day.  :-)"
"2","Amazing and authentic German food! We just got back from a trip to Germany (Nuremberg and Munich) and the food took me right back to our trip. \n\nWe have been here numerous times for food and beer. They have an excellent selection of Belgium beers....some of these I actually drank in Germany.\n\nCame here for lunch today with my husband. We both ordered the bratwurst sandwich. It was a bratwurst split in half, covered with craut, and on a soft pretzel bun. So many flavors and soooooo good! Definitely recommend it! \n\nOverall, excellent spot with great authentic beer and food. \n\nPS- A few month ago when we went here, we ended up chatting with our server for a long time. She was from Germany and was extremely knowlegable about German food and culture. It was so interesting talking with someone who just recently moved to the US from Germany."
"1","I took an out-of-town guest here for dinner.  Our hopes were up as we walked up to the building and then entered.\n\nThe restaurant was busy with two private parties; however, we were seated upon arrival, and there was still plenty of seating available.\n\nFirst off, the beer menu.  They have a fairly decent selection of drafts and bottles--think an extended list of your usual German suspects (Spaten, Franziskaner, Warsteiner, etc.).  Ultimately, I wasn't very impressed.\n\nThe bill of fare had a decent amount of variety, and the descriptions made narrowing a selection difficult.  Fortunately, the sampler special of the evening provided a convenient choice!\n\nI started with the bowl of Hungarian Goulash.  The portion was quite large.  However, I found the broth somewhat too salty, and the meat chunks were dry and tough.\n\nLike the soup, I found my entree to be a little too salty, which was disappointing, because the spaetzle and red cabbage were otherwise quite nice.  I found the meats to be somewhat dry and tough, similar to that of the goulash.  All of this was too bad, because the portions were easily large enough for two meals.\n\nFinally, I'm guessing \""dry\"" must be a theme at this place, because even the black forest cake was also a little dry.\n\nFor the record:  I didn't complain nor send any of the food back out of respect for my guest.  I just didn't want to create a scene in front of my guest.\n\nWaitstaff were prompt enough, but our server kept forgetting drink orders and generally just seemed nonchalant about providing good service.\n\n\nSo, minus one star for the ditzy waitress.  Minus 1.5 stars for the food.  I rounded down, because I disagree with the more positive reviews.  I was expecting something stellar, and I feel rather let down.\n\nI will come back and give them one more chance, but only one more chance."
"2","First time here this past Friday for lunch. Hadn't had a Wiener schnitzel since Vienna. I really enjoyed Waldhorn 's version. I will be back."
"2","Best German food in town. A good traditional beer selection along with traditional favorites such as wurst and schnitzel. Their Oktoberfest tent is a blast and worth a visit. If you can't make it across the pond then the Waldhorn  is a trip worth making."
"2","This was our first  experience at the Waldhorn and, I must say, we were impressed. Our experience started with beers (of course) before dinner while we waited for our table. The bar staff was pleasant, welcoming, and quite efficient. The bar had 11 German beers on tap, ranging from Pilsner to Optimator, and several more in bottles. \n\nDespite the fact that it was restaurant week in Charlotte and the Waldhorn had an impressive Queen's Feast (4 courses), we decided to order from the regular menu. We started with the sausage sampler. Each sausage was delicious and presented beautifully with a dollop of sour kraut and a bit of mustard. \n\nFor our main courses, I had the rouladen and my wife had the sauerbraten.  Simply put, it was the best rouladen I have had in a restaurant. Tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Karen's sauerbraten was fork-tender and served in a light, but delicious, sauce. \n\nWe finished with the apple strudel and ice cream. Flakey and warm. A perfect way to end the evening. \n\nThe only real negative to our experience was the roaming accordion player. Don't get me wrong, he was a fine musician. However, the music was almost unbearably loud in such confined spaces. Conversation became a controlled shouting match while he was around. \nOverall, you should go there.  Just don't eat for a day or two prior to your visit."
"2","An all around great restaurant!  The service is friendly and fast and the food does not disappoint.  The sausage plate and goat cheese appetizers are both fantastic as well as the complimentary pretzel rolls.  They have plenty of traditional German fare such as Weinerschnitzel, sauerkraut, spaetzle, etc. and it is all delicious!  Beware: the portions are HUGE.  Luckily, they offer a \""Lite Appetite\"" menu as well. If you save room for dessert, the apple strudel is a must. It's great to have this restaurant in Charlotte, it's very unique and stands out."
"1","Now I really try to like this place , especially since my fianc\u00e9 lived in Germany for a few years and when I took him here with friends for his birthday he proposed to me . So of course it is special to me for other reasons. However this site is to help review the food and to be honest I just think it's bland and incredibly boring.. The only items I care for are the red cabbage and the dumplings other than that I have tried several different things because my fianc\u00e9 gets in the mood for German food and this is the only place in Charlotte we know of .. Other than for sentimental reasons though I personally would not chose to eat here."
"1","We have lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years and always wanted to go to this place, but were put off because they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. Last night, the two of us decided to walk in early (about 6:00 P.M. on a Friday night, our date night) and were immediately seated. We were put in a back room containing two large, long tables and a few tables for four. One of the large tables was already filled with about 20 people, and the noise was deafening. That entire room apparently has nothing on the walls or ceiling to absorb noise. We noticed that, at one of the tables for four, people were getting up and leaving without ordering. Even worse, the place has a lot of young children who were constantly running around and getting in the way of the waitstaff which, by the way, was excellent.\n\nWe started with two Ketel One on the rocks. When ordering a second round, we were told they had run out of Ketel One--at 6:15 on a Friday night. We then split a Waldhorn salad, which was good. We both had the sauerbraten with spaeztle and red cabbage. The meat was dry and the spaetzle didn't even look or taste like spaetzle. From our experience, spaetzle are dumplings pressed through a sieve.. This stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles. Since I love Black Forest cake, I took a piece home. It was tasteless, and the fruit center was nothing more than filler. This was represented to us as \""home made.\""\n\nThe owners of this place are represented as having been culinary-institute trained. We can't believe it. We have eaten at restaurants owned and operated by culinary-institute graduates and the food tasted nothing like this. We cannot, therefore, understand the rave reviews. We also cannot understand how culinary-institute graduates (if this is actually so) could serve this stuff. To each his own, I guess."
"2","We were in Charlotte visiting Carowinds and we were tired when we checked into our hotel. Plan A was to find a mid-level chain and bring take-out back to our room, but then I spotted Waldhorn's on the list. The ratings and reviews looked way too good to be true, but I have a soft spot for German food and the prices looked downright reasonable. So we rallied and had one of the best dining experiences of our lives.\n\nThe service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Great recommendations on beer and appetizer.\n\nWith a Warsteiner Dunkel for him and a Spaten Oktoberfest for me, we started with a Gebackener Ziegenk\u00e4se. The pastry was light and perfectly crisped. The goat cheese, spinach & sun-dried tomato filling was surprisingly light, even after dredging it through the brown gravy and sour cream.\n\nFor our entree, my other half ordered the Hausgemachte Maultaschen \""geschmelzt\"", pasta filled with meat and spinach, lightly dressed with sauteed onions and beef broth. I ordered Wienerschnitzel, but I wasn't enthused about french fries and the veg of the day (broccoli) being served with it, so the server cheerfully and enthusiastically switched them for spaetzle and red cabbage. \n\nOur meals were perfect. Every single mouthful was perfect. The spaetzle was really light and was sincerely the best I've ever had. The red cabbage was beautifully prepared. The wienerschnitzel melted in my mouth. His meal was a little lighter than mine, but still filling and so very delicious.\n\nAnd reasonable! Two beers, appetizer, and two entrees? $50 before the tip. \n\nNow I'm mad because it's so far away."
"1","NOT repeat Not for celiacs! The kitchen ignores whatever the server tells them. When the meal comes out wrong, everyone else is done before the plate comes back out. The manager apologizes, but it they don't take it seriously, this happened both times we've been here, but we won't be back. I like the food, but I don't like dining alone."
"2","I compare all German foods and restaurants in one way ... \""Is it as good as Mama Schuele's home cooking?\""\nThe answer is never \""Yes\"", but the Waldhorn is as close as I have ever come to that.\n\nWe come for the Sunday Brunch,  which offers a great selection of breakfast foods along with many German favorites. \n\nI'm currently enjoying that along with a litre of my favorite Hefeweizen. Good times."
"2","Really good stuff!!! Service was incredible - pretzel rolls were to-die-for. I think between 3 of us, we had 3 baskets.... Sausages are delectable and spaetzle and red cabbage is awesome. We are to be new regulars!!!"
"2","What a great restaurant with authentic German food! We arrived Sunday night at 7:30 and the parking lot was pretty full, a good sign. Overall the food was fantastic, flavorful, delicious and served just right. We enjoyed the pretzel rolls with our entrees of schnitzel and rouladen, just authentic German food. The inside decor was fitting, not overdone but comfortable and spot on. The service was attentive and friendly. As out of town visitors we were very pleased to find the Waldhorn, and plan to visit again."
"2","Great food, but still miss the German restaurant in hickory. We will be back for sure. Very nice place. Loved the carpaccio, a must have,"
"2","Best authentic German restaurant around! I go there for lunch and dinner. They always have good specials that normally aren't on the menu. Be sure to join their Beer Club, and definitely check out the annual Oktoberfest."
"2","Unreal German food in a decent environment with excellent service!\nI also love the plethora of German beer. It is sooooo good! I had the Rindsrouladen...\nBraised Beef Rouladen stuffed with bacon, onions and pickle. It was delicous in every way.The side items were Sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage... also excellent.\nA pleasant surprise was the house salad. Ridiculously good. Fresh mixed greens. Perfect amount of dressing. and underneath in four little piles were surprises of carrot, pasta, cabbage, and another Item I have forgotten. All delicious little piles. Like gifts!\nOh, and I almost forgot the BREAD! Good God! The pretzel rolls with a little butter are otherworldly. I want to come back here so bad ... but living in KC it is going to be a while."
"2","Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. I like the wurst platte and the wife loves Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread."
"1","FREE 60-Day Membership - WARNING.  I got a coupon for a Free 60 day Membership from a Valpak mailing to my house.  My wife had me go there to claim the membership and get some Milk.  BJ's Customer Service informed me that I would have to buy a $40 dollar one year membership that I could get a refund up to one year.  They basically give you the first 60 days free, then 12 additional months for $40, then $50 the next year after that.  They should just state.  The first 14 months are refundable if you decide to cancel.  Seemed a bit complicated to me.  Is this actually a promotion?  It is definitely not 60 days FREE with no questioned asked."
"2","If you've ever been to a Sam's Club (and I was a member a few years back), then the experience at a BJ's will be the same. Gigantic big box store (larger than your typical Wal-Mart) with high bay racks of storage that go all the way up to the ceiling.\n\nBJ's is a membership store and while you can do a trial shop (15% surcharge), you're better off simply joining for $50 a year. Yes, the do have specials and discounts but those are not year round.\n\nAs for the stuff, well, there's nearly everything. You might not be able to do a full grocery shop but you can certainly buy up a cartloads worth of stuff and in the process save some money on the bulk. Two-packs of some things seemed to be maybe half-again the price of buying one at Harris Teeter. Others are competitive with what you might find at Wal-Mart.\n\nI was impressed with the decent selection of pet food products, including a 50 pound bag of the same dog food I usually get at Petsmart but $10 cheaper.\n\nSo yes, I joined. And I'll be back.\n\nThe gas is cheaper than others nearby but it's still more expensive than going to South Carolina."
"1","Slowest deli department in town. They have no sense of time so you know they don't value you yours. If they are attempting to push you to buy pre-packaged this is a novel and effective way to do so, by delivering the slowest and most impersonal service EVER! Fail BJ's"
"1","Never heard of BJ's until I received a free 60 day membership in the mail.  After visiting this store, I know realize why they send FREE memberships.  I found it extremely off-putting to be greeted by the smell of old food at the entrance.  It has a gloomy atmosphere and is relatively small. \n\nI was unable to justify spending $50 or $100 for their membership.  Especially, since I didn't see any significant savings on the items that I would be interested in purchasing (paper & cleaning products).   I do think it is cool that they accept coupons and all forms of payment.  \n\nUltimately,  BJ's is too grimy, smelly and disheveled looking for me.  It is definitely Costco's distant, twice removed cousin."
"1","Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal, when they seated us it looked like the booth had not been properly cleaned, and the bathroom was just the nastiest bathroom in America. Like i said i understand it was busy but that is no excuse for how gross the bathroom was. i almost threw up from the smell and you could just tell that it probably had not been cleaned all day. I believe when you are an establishment with meals over $10 your bathroom should be spotless. This is something you would expect from burger king or somewhere, not red lobster. I know red lobster is not a 5 star restaurant but come on."
"2","Lunch today!!  Wood fired shrimp shewers. wild rich pilaf and brocolli.  Wonderful and Service was friendly and attentive!!  Will difinitely be back!! cheese biscuits appetizers were good too!  Got busy while we were there, Restaurant was clean."
"2","Great food and service. Very happy with my visit."
"1","\""Red Lobster is where America goes for seafood!\""\nI think that was their one-time slogan. \nThis won't be the location I will go for their seafood, anyway. \n\nI really like Red Lobster. I think it's about the best place to find crab legs locally that are cooked correctly, but it comes at a price.\n\nLet's start with their overpriced drinks: They've got a lot of cocktails to choose from, but they really skimp on the liquor. I don't mind paying upwards of $6-$7 but at least put in some alkie-hall that I can taste.\n\nThe biscuits: As long as they come out hot, I have no complaints. Often imitated but never duplicated. These babies will fill you up if you don't watch how many you eat.\n\nThe appetizer: Mozzarella Cheesesticks. Meh. They used to have the best years ago but they've messed with the recipe on both the breading and marinara too much over the years.\n\nThe salad: I used to favor their Caesar salad over most everyone else, but they've changed and skimped on the dressing. I think I'd rather have their soup.\n\nThe meal: The Ultimate Feast. I could not resist. 2 small lobster tails, 1/2 lb of snow crab legs, 4 fried shrimps, and shrimp scampi. I got a side of broccoli because they've once again messed with their recipe on their mashed-potatoes. Their baked potatoes no longer have the skin encrusted in salt. Shrimp, crab, and lobster were great. Broccoli had no flavor. I had to dip in in the butter of the scampi for flavor. Protions seem to have shrunk on a lot of the items though.\n\nThe dessert: Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie. One of the best desserts ever although this one was skimpy on the \""lava\"".\n\nThe location: Never go to Red Lobster on a Sunday. There is no time of that particular day that you won't find yourself waiting.  Parking is a b!tch. It's a near nightmare getting in and out of the mall parking lot that this location is a part of.\n\nThe service: Lackluster. I won't name names but our waiter was absent for the most part. I know it was busy but he seemed to only have a handful of tables in our area. Maybe he had other tables on the other part of the restaurant but he seemed to have a good knowledge of the ACC games that were going on at the time. Just sayin'. Drink refills were few and far between. Getting the check and even a pen to sign the damned thing was too lengthy. This isn't the first time we've had so-so service at this location, either.\n\nThe price: Too expensive for what you get. Prices have gone up on anything and everything at RL. We make a trip to them maybe twice a year at the most.\n\nIt's hard to give this place the rating I gave. The taste of the food justifies the higher part of the rating but the service and costs are more like a \""2\""\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"1","I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat, although it was not to long. This place seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. The food was not prepared well. The shell of the crab legs were spongy and bent with the crackers. The baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre. I will not be back to this location"
"1","This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show. \n\nWe were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.\n\nThe seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE butter but  sometimes too much of a good thing can ruin a meal. The shrimp were TINY and the Lobster Tail was TINY\n\nIt was pricey too considering we had 2 Childrens Entr\u00e9es. The kids mac and cheese was Kraft. Sort of a joke really. $5,99 for Mac and Cheese from a box. When are restaurants going to get a clue and offer more than chicken fingers and mac and cheese on the kids menu? Some kids do have an adventurous spirit and will eat real food.\n\nI may go back for a lunch and their biscuits but will probably pass on them for dinner."
"1","Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!"
"2","Food is always really good! Although the service is not all that. First time we went we had a server who was in training and of course we understood if she would make mistakes. Although our second time, the server was slow and did not communicate well. We rarely had refills and was slow to give is our checks and run our cards. Even though it was not very busy. Food is great, service not so much."
"1","Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue."
"1","My wife and her family took me here for my birthday, the service was ok we had about 12 people nothing too big. We had two servers both were pretty nice. We ordered food kept it going like a normal service I got the Bar Harbor and it was pretty awesome I got them to add Cajun seasoning into it since I like spicy food. But rather good couldn't complain.\n\nBUT my wife's grandma got a steak and Lobster, she order a medium and it came out well done and her lobster was raw no idea how this happened considering you cook them at two different times but so be it. She sent it back and by the time she got it back we had already ate all our food and had finished desert. I mean what the heck how does it take that long to cook a medium steak? It doesn't! By the time she got her food she wasn't hungry anymore.\n\nSo we get the checks and the server tells me that the manager comped her food since it was messed up and that we wouldn't have to worry about paying for it. Well then they gave her another bill and said that she had to pay for it how the hell that works is beyond me, but she was stuck paying for the damn food that the manager told us we would get credited. \n\nNear the end of the service the servers lacked and kind of vanished and it was just a huge cluster. The quality of this place just tanked and fell low.\n\nThe only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb!!! Everything else is a joke."
"1","WhAt. A  disapointment......we ordered a salmon plate , my daughter a sirloin and wifey ordered. A shrimp kabobs, we got our drinks at 155 then about 245 we got our plates,food was barely warm, server was alright, though"
"1","will never go here again b/c for the 3rd time they messed up my to go order. they offered me a gift card one time but never got it. they tried to \""apoligize\"" but it was half harted in the apology. they claimed when i was there that all my order was in the bag and when i got home to check it was not. I will never got there again. they are to serve the customers and they are doing a poor job in doing that. they really don't care about the customers and they need to have the check in hand when they are putting the orders together."
"1","The lobster tail was salty. The crab legs were alright. The shrimp was awesome. The asparagus was amazing. All in all it was eh."
"1","The parking lot is dark and scary.  There were rusty carts strewn about.  Boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store.  I went twice in the past week and they had one register open with four other people doing nothing both times.  First cashier wasn't friendly but the most recent one was.  The prices were okay.  I had a Groupon for the first visit and 15% off for the second.  The store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care."
"1","I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized, but I would expect that for a Saturday afternoon."
"1","Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread."
"1","Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch.  I have always eaten at their salad bar, which is actually quite tiny.  For a salad buffet, Souper Salad offers significantly more salad toppings and additional buffet options at a similar price.  I feel like I never get my money's worth at Jason's, though the salads there are tasty and nutritious."
"1","Huge disappointment.\n\nI wanted a real deli sandwich (not Subway).  I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6\"" meatball sub on a white bun, Lay's potato chips, and a pickle spear, with a regular soda.  The sub was not one bit better than Subway.  This was a complete waste of my time and money.  I could have had the same exact thing (sans the pickle), and chosen my own chips from a variety.  \nThey have a lot of food on the menu; I have no idea how the soups, salads, etc. are.  All I know is that I couldn't even find a list of the types of bread they offer on the menu.  This place is hard to navigate, and the food quality is not worth the trouble.\n\nUPDATE:  Went back for lunch (at a friend's request) on Tuesday (11/1).  I had the chicken club salad and a cup of the Southwestern Chicken Chili.  Both were quite good.  My bill:  $14.90.  I'll up the rating to 2 stars, as the food is OK (not great), but it is WAY overpriced."
"2","The food is excellent.  The service is average and the place is over priced.  BUT THE FOOD IS GGGGGGGRRRRREEEEEEEAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTT"
"1","Grub wise, Jason's deli is pretty affordable and the food is decent. No complaints there. The to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho. About once a month everyone at work decides \""lets have Jason's  for lunch\"". I am the person who gets to make this happen. \nFirst time i saw they offered delivery \""Sweet, right?\"" Um no, Its like $8 extra for delivery. Which they don't tell you over the phone. Not cool. On this occasion the money collection at work wasn't adding up so i had to call for itemized sammich prices and only then was i told about the delivery charge. They did wave it since they had neglected to mention it but $8 to deliver 1 mile, no thank you, not doing that again.\nSo now i call everything in and pick it up myself...not once out of roughly 20 orders has everything actually been correct. Dressings for salads have been left out, menu items missing and sometimes haven't even made it on to the ticket...requests for extra pickles ignored. It's an uphill battle with this place. So, its not to be obnoxious but i have to take everything out before i leave and verify all the food is there. Ive been conditioned. My advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same.\nLike i said, the food is actually pretty good but honestly i don't think grabbing a few sandwiches and salads need to be so difficult."
"2","What a wonderful experience!  I am so impressed by this place and I'm mad at myself it took me this long to come.  They have a very large selection of sandwiches and a large salad bar.  My favorite part is getting the half sandwich (any on the menu) and half salad (which is large enough to put your head in).  There are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too.  Everything is fresh and/or organic.  I'll go any chance I'm over this way."
"1","The restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly.  But, the food was just okay the corn beef was sliced too thick and it was tough."
"2","This is one of the most accommodating places I have ever had the pleasure of dining.  The staff is fantastic... I come with my two dogs and sit outside on the patio and everyone is always checking on us, offering water right when I get there for my babies and the food is so fresh and delicious."
"2","Went here to get 4 tires and they were extremely quick! Within one hour, they quoted me (a great price) and had the tires installed. Was surprised that they came in lower than other competitors, so definitely check them out."
"1","Ok, how do you review a place, as your daughter is in pain, it's been 2 hours now and you are stuck in the waiting room, yelping the time away just hoping that she will be next ,and you are still yelping hours later.\n\nI can't quite bring myself to terms as to why it takes so long in an emergency room......I watch ER it doesn't take this long.  \n\nSo in my delusional state I am in right now, I just look at all the people around, look at the pace of the staff and there is just no EMERGENCY.  Why can't we just change the name EMERGENCY room to the hey let's get a bunch of people together in pain misery and sickness, and call it a circus.  I mean really, this is ridiculous.\n\nI will provide a time frame for this ADVENTURE.\n\nCurrent Time of yelping: 6:20pm. \nWaiting..........Started yelping.......\n\nCurrent Time of yelping: 8:28pm. \nWaiting.......

"1","I've been going to this hospital long before it became part of the CMC system. The staff is great especially the nurses, but the amount of time that you have to wait to see a doctor in the emergency room is ridiculous. Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well. The rest of the time that I spent there showed me that the ER needs a serious refresher course in triage."
"2","I went to the Vein Center for a hair removal treatment. I was greeted on time. The procedure took 10 mins - in and out. Clean, nice staff. Beware though if you are more than 5 minutes late, they will turn you away."
"1","(6/24/2013) Well its time for my 3 year check up to see what the state of my pituitary tumor is. For some unfathomable reason CMC-Pineville wanted me to show up an hour early at the main entrance. There is actually plenty of surface parking this early in the morning so that's a plus. The main waiting area is also empty.\n\nThe MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.  The room is painted in muted blue and olive green. There is a 47\"" LG tv hung in the middle of the wall containing the check in window. There is also an alcove with a coffee maker & bottled water.\n\nI had been sitting behind a column & for some odd reason the tech didn't look into the entire room. I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.\n\nSo far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along. I will never have another MRI done there. Perhaps they knew that they wouldn't be getting excellent reviews of their service as I have not received any surveys to complete."
"1","My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying \""I don't have time to talk to him \"" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl,Antibiotic and Morphine !!! Both me and my husband strongly disagree because she's a little baby and just because she is screaming her lungs out and has severe skin flares ups does not mean she needs morphine!!!! We were transfer to Levine and the doctor there was also shocked when we told him they were gonna give her morphine."
"1","Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized, no sense of urgency, and spend most of their time eating and chatting in the hall.  You will waste 3 hours in the ER bleeding from a head injury and concussion as others keep gerring treatment.  One nurse said \""oh we keep forgetting about you\""  WTF!   Go here to die!"
"2","This location has awful reviews on Google. Just awful... I was nervous going in but I received better service here than at the one across town by Northlake. David's normally doesn't carry anything in my size but the ladies here heard me out and understood that I had spoken to the bride and had gotten the okay to get a dress other than the one she had registered us for. \n\nI really appreciate that none of them suggested that I \""eat more\"" or buy a dress that is too large and get it cut down - as though either of those are viable options. \n\nThey took really good care of me, I was in & out in about half an hour. This includes trying the dress i wanted in the smallest size they had on hand (2) and having their alterations lady drop what she was doing and come pin me up to confirm that it was indeed too big. \n\nAnd I didn't have to fight traffic. Win."
"2","I ordered a pair of shoes with a saleslady at this location.  She was super friendly and professional.  When I went pin to pick up the shoes another super friendly staff member was there to help me! I left feeling very happy and excited for my wedding.  I should have gone here and not Northlake to buy my dress! !!"
"1","Best way to put our experience there into words? Bipolar. We went for a prom dress. Poor customer service (other than the consultants who were great, that's why I rate 2 stars, one each for each consultant we worked with, the store itself and other staff get a zero), turning away people 40 min prior to close, guess they don't want to work one minute past 7pm = lost sales/revenue, restocking holds even after calling to say we were coming to get it prior to closing, 5 minute alterations taking over an hour (a brides bustle apparently trumped us, we learned this later, we were willing to pick up the dress another day but were asked to wait). Here's our experience if you care for details...visit one, Saturday morning...we walked in and saw prom/bridesmaid etc. to our left and migrated towards the dresses. Okay, yes, the was a little podium to our right with a woman standing there, but didn't think anything of it (assumption was made, that she is there for women with bridal fitting appointments). She didn't say a word to us. We perused the dresses, pulled some, even asked someone at the sales counter if a certain dress was available in another size somewhere (was told what was out was what they had and that was fine). Still, no one mentioned to us that in order to try on the dresses, we needed a junior consultant working with us (everyone is apparently supposed to check in with the lady at the podium). They had 2 opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us. Anyway, we go \""sign in\"", the lady at the podium barks over the intercom for a consultant and my daughter is taken to a fitting room. I will say this, the stylist/consultant was very nice and very kind. We put 2 dresses on hold, since this was the first store we visited and headed to some other stores to shop. When it became clear, around 5pm that the dress she wanted was one of the ones at David's, I called to let them know we were coming for it and not to restock it. They said great and we headed back in that direction. When we got there at 5:30, the dress had been restocked. They couldn't find it in the \""on holds area\"" WTH? I didn't complain, just glad it was still THERE, albeit on the regular sales rack. My daughter tried it on again and we noted the hook and eye closure was broken and there was a seem pull on the back as well. Again I will say, the consultant this round was very nice and kind as well, just as much as the first, even helping my daughter find matching shoes etc. and getting the minor alterations done on the spot. Or so we thought. Here's where I need to complain. The alteration lady took the dress to the back, and after about 20 min, we inquired what was taking so long. Our consultant was kind enough to go check for us and came back and said she was currently working on it, We had dinner plans, it was after 6 at this point so we said we could come back for it. The consultant seemed miffed at that and asked us the wait, since the alterations were being done, right then, and the alteration lady was taking the time to do it immediately and putting other things aside for us. We felt bad, and stuck around. BAD idea. At 6:20, still waiting, a prom girl comes in and tries to check in with the podium and is TURNED AWAY, the woman there tells her that since they close at 7pm, she won't have time to try on dresses. WTH again?! There is 40 minutes left to pick and try on dresses! Our visit that morning was only 40 minutes? Lost sale opportunity. We witnessed this again 10 min later, this time with a bride and her bridesmaid seeking bridesmaids dresses. At 6:45, we were done...late for dinner, it had been an hour, when finally, the alterations woman comes out. She was apologetic at least, telling us a bride's bustle had to jump in front of us. Another WTH moment! We were fine picking it up another day but were told she was working on it and asked to wait. A very frustrating moment indeed. Someone should have come and told us that, we would have left and come back. Overall, their consultants, who I'm sure work on commission, were motivated, friendly and helpful. The other staff were horrible! What's also bad for this location is I am a bride and haven't begun my dress search but perused a little while I was there, even mentioned I was a bride, totally went on deaf ears. Another lost sale opportunity. We will never shop here again."
"1","Buyers beware! I wouldn't even give this place a rating if I didn't have to! Long story short, they don't have a return policy even if they send you directive items!!! I had to fight for days to get them to take back a pair of shoes I had to order from another location because the only pair they had were dirty with nasty feet prints. The so called manager made me feel like I was wasting her time the THREE times I came in to return the defective shoes. (They had rhinestones missing) She gave me the worst run around telling me I can only make an exchange. She had absolutely no compassion for me and wanting a pair of beautiful wedding shoes. She offered to fix the shoes by gluing some random stones on with some silver glitter.....it looked like trash. Finally after about a week of going back and fourth, the store manager at the Columbia SC location authorized a return at Pineville. I really had high hopes for this place but I will not be getting my 8 bridesmaid dresses here. They lost out big time with me. Maybe next time they should check their merchandise better before they let a brides hopes down."
"2","Today 6/2/14 I made a appointment to get fitted for a bridesmaid dress. The minute I walked in the staff was super nice. Samantha G. helped me find the exact dress I needed!!"
"1","On my first appointment to buy my wedding dress and to find dresses for my 7 bridesmaids the attention was great and i was in love with the dresses. They promised so many things and made the whole situation sound great. Once my dress arrived and i went to pick it up the staff at the door was rude and they wanted me to sign the paper to pick up my dress without me looking at it first. Once i told them that i wasn't going to sign anything without inspecting my dress first, the women at the front was still rude. Another lady came up to me and told me to pick up my dress and to follow her to the back. Which i was agrevated already for their attitude. Once in the back i was already shaking and very close to cry for this experience. I open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed. My dress was really wrinkle and non of their staff helped me to put on my dress to makr sure it fitted. This was the worst experienced ever and to realize that i brought them bussiness. My dress was very expensive and on top of that i have all 7 bridesmaids bying their dress with them. I will not recommend David's Bridal store in Pineville. Their corporate should train their personnel and increase  their customer service. And of course the person that sold me dress didn't work there anymore....."
"2","Lenscrafters...the standard in \""while you wait\"" glasses, almost exclusively located in malls around the country.  My boyfriend had been wearing glasses taped together on the sides for oh, about 9 months now, so I decided to make him an appointment for new specs.  We were in and out in a matter of two hours, counting the wait time for his new glasses to be made.  The staff were knowledgable and friendly, without being pushy or trying to force him into choosing something he didn't like because they are \""trendy\"" (it's happened to us before!)  They were also running a special, so we got $100 off the frames and lenses, which really helps when your insurance only covers the exam.  All in all, a great experience.  We will be back when I need contacts! :)"
"1","I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask."
"1","There is no doubt that the ambiance is better than many other optical's shops but the prices are very high. \n\nWe saw the same product in Carolina's mall in sears Optical's at a way lower price point. I am definitely disappointed."
"1","I wouldn't even give them one star at this location!! Beware Dr. Jeffrey Musler and Associates optometry group PA!!! This was the worst service and experience I have ever received!!! The ladies at the reception desk are horrible!!!! I called to order contacts and they were utterly confused. Miscommunication across the board. The receptionist said \""maybe\"" they'll go ahead and service me and they might call me back and hung up on me! I was simply trying to order contacts as the doctor told me it would be easy as calling in to do so. Terrible place and I would not recommend this facility to anyone."
"1","Booooo"
"1","Where to begin my review as this will be my 1st and last review for this place.  I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted, mind you dealing with the register.  As my families meal was brought out, I see a line cook stuffing his face with no gloves on just his bare hands.   I said to myself, this is unsanitary practices being used here.  I then ask another worker to call the managers attention who's behind her and she gets into the \""deer\"" mode, acting as if who's the manager. I finally make eye contact with him as he knew I was right and went to the kitchen to possibly tell the guy stuffing his face, you got caught.  The manager was looking all dirty himself too, no name tag, no indication that he's the manager.  I asked for a full refund, I was not spending my money here.  I then ask for his name which he pulls out his a$$ and says it's \""Mr. Rapport\"".  Well that's the name I'll use when I compile a letter to the corporate office.  Please beware of this place, save your money for a pack of bologna instead."
"1","Be careful when shopping here !  Bought an $8,000+ bed.  Delivered broken !  Are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery.  More interested in sales than checking their product.  Poor attention to detail, poor quality.  When selling expensive products ladies and gentlemen, you need to make sure the product is not broken before delivering - check it in the warehouse - rather simple if you really care. No excuse for discovering a broken product in front of a customer.  Buyer beware with these folks."
"1","First visit: We ordered a pizza from the menu on the wall. The ingredients were olives and tomatoes. When pizza came it was covered in onions, and there were a smattering of small chopped olives and tomatoes..it looked like an onion tart. My kids refused...to eat this. We also had to go get our own tea and water, as our waitress forgot, she never refilled...we did that too.\n\nAnother visit: my daughter wanted to have her birthday dinner there with some friends. We made reservations months in advance and called day before to confirm. They were confused when we got there....didn't acknowledge we were waiting...and finally took us into the dining room. They tried to sit us at a too small booth that had a huge tear in the seat. NO. We finally got our seat at a table that was actually large enough for all of us...service was spotty. \n\non to the food. There is nothing spectacular about anything they serve. It tastes like chef boy rdee, or frozen dinners. Serving family style is nice, but it is akward to go with friends and do this. \n\nLast visit 4 of us went....3 of us were sick for several days after...2 ended up at emergency room for IV...1 went to doctor for phenegren.....we will not be back after that experience for sure!!!"
"1","My husband and I ate at Buca di Beppo for lunch today for the first time.  Neither of us were impressed.  The staff was slow and somewhat unresponsive (even though it wasn't busy in the least), the food was subpar and the prices were too high for what we received. \n\nI would not return!"
"1","We haven't been here in over a year and it was time to return and see if there was any changes. First, the decor is still cool...lots of pictures, statues, albums on the wall. We were greeted by everybody working there ---very nice. Ordered the apple Gorgonzola salad. It came out wrong and had to be reordered. This is a really wonderful salad....Unfortuately it took 15 Min's to get it the second time. Their bread used to be wonderful too.....hot and fresh full of flavor now it's just plain old french bread tasteless. \nOur entree of lasagna came out on a very hot plate but was cold but burnt on the bottom. Manager came to the rescue and immediately took care of the problem. I liked the idea of having the chef bring out the correct entree since it was his fault and not the waiter. \nWould I go back? Probably not, too many good Italian restaurants in the area that are better"
"1","Let me start by saying their food is top notch, my favorite is baked rigatoni with whole wheat penne and I have the italian sausage replaced with ground beef. I wish they offered a small salad with the order instead of an addon but you definitely get your moneys worth in quantity. ALSO, if you are on the lookout there are ALWAYS buca coupons in the sunday papers, in valpak, and if you search for google apps on android. So if this was based on food I would give Buca a 5.\n\nI took my Italian gf to Buca on her bday at her request and I must say the dining experience was the WORST either of us have ever experienced. We went during the week and they had maybe 8 different \""tables\"" or groups dining in...they put us all in the same room (with the other 4-5 rooms EMPTY) and bunched us together with everyone. I'm literally sitting side by side with another group on a bench inevitably hearing every word of their conversation. Ideally you take your gf out on her Bday you want a private personable dinner where you can talk without hearing every word of someone elses conversation....that alone was bad when they had so much room in the restaurant. \n\nOn top of that we had the worst waitress ever, Cassandra.....she harassed us literally every 2-3 minutes asking us if the food was okay, talking about the weather, etc...she was interrupting us CONSTANTLY. My gf and I began being short with her so she would let us enjoy our dinner and she just didn't take the clue. On top of that the host who worked at the front door kept coming back and doing the same, CONSTANTLY. It's nice that people care that your meal is okay, but theres no need to ask us how our meal is literally every few minutes when I'm eating the same thing. My gf and I could not talk without the constant interruption.\n\nHorrible experience dine in but we have continued to go back for their TAKE OUT....We generally will call 20-30 mins in advance, then showup to get our orders and its still not ready often we'll have to sit there and wait another 10-20 mins like they didn't start it until we got there. The food is so good, and they give you SOOOOOO much (leftovers for days) it makes it worth it but the customer service is very low in my opinion."
"1","12/26/11 7:45pm.\nI go to the hostess station and request seating for one.  Hostess asks if i wish to be seated at the bar, and I politely declined.  She then said \""we are not taking any more walk in business tonight.\""  \n\nI have a suggestion on where this place can shove a few of their meatballs."
"1","Two and a half stars, neither A-ok nor real bad. \nI was at Carolina Place around 1:30 pm and decided to give this restaurant a try -I was told it's the best Eyetalian in Charlotte.\n\nFirst the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact.\nthat's it for the good.\n\nService was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of \""family dining\"" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer. \n\nMy idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs."
"1","The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here, we were hungry shortly after. Go figure. Well, the service here on the times we have visited has never knocked our socks off. Just okay. Very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy. It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty. Not a place we want to run to on a regular, but good enough for a \""snack\""."
"1","I have to give Buca di Beppo props on the ambiance they create.  You cannot find another restaurant like it (or if there is one - I am not aware of it).  \n\nFor those that are not familiar with Buca di Beppo, it is an Italian restaurant that serves family style meals.  Any dish you order is meant to be split between members of your party - so if you have a party of 2-4, you really only need to order 1-2 dishes for the party.  Me, being the picky eater that I am, I would rather order my own dish than share.  \n\nAt least with this experience, did not have the best server.  He did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job.  He was willing to split the bill among the five people in our party, but one person in our group ordered an alcoholic beverage and the price of her drink was split amongst the people in our party.  \n\nThey might only do this if there are people in your party that have not eaten at Buca di Beppo, but when they take you to your table, they walk you through the kitchen (which has a table for patrons to eat their meals at).   The only plus side of going here for meals."
"1","...called at 6p to see if they would take reservations for that night. yes, but not 7p... 7:15p is open. Cool, table for 4 at 7:15 it is. We arrived at 7:10 and were told we will call your name when a table is ready... at 7:25 I asked if our 7:15 reservation was ready yet and she said we are a little behind. There are a few still ahead of you... Our name was called at 7:46 after 4 tables of 4 and a table of 6 were seated. \nAnyone can take a reservation... Its the holding of the reservation that counts right? (UNHAPPY)\n The food was OK, a small salad for the table, 2 shared dinners for 4, a side of pasta with a meatball & 1, $12 bottle of wine and 2 deserts nothing worth going out of your way for at a cost of almost $150.00. There was also 5 or 6 \""birthday/clapping\"" sessions around us like at Applebees.\nThe wait staff was nice, quick and good looking, but I'd rather have a slow, ugly waiter with good food myself.\nNo hurry to go back there... ever."
"1","I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. \n\nTo make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. \n\nAlas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. \n\nShe literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one."
"1","First of, I really love Buca's food. It's really good and a favorite of mine and my roommate's is the Baked Ziti. We love the atmosphere of it and we honestly have a good time(usually) when we go but recently...the past few visits haven't been so great.\n\n(03/13)Starting off with last night(Wednesday), my roommate and I planned to go  after I got off work for their National Raviolli day coupon. We got there at 9:20, 40 minutes before they closed. I know it's a little late but we can normally get done within that time frame. But when we walked in, we waited for a few minutes before the hostess finally walked into the waiting area...with her purse over her shoulder.\n\nShe told us they had already closed and after mentioning that we thought they didn't close until 10(we checked the website before going), she reluctantly took us to a table...in a room where everyone else was. It was a little awkward for us and after waiting for maybe 5 minutes while discussing whether we should stay or not, we left. The impression we got upon arriving, although late, left a sour note. We're both very disappointed and ended up settling for pizza(which is no where near as good as their food). I was really looked forward to it all day until I showed up.\n\n(02/13)The time before that I went with my roommate again and a friend. We arrived an hour before close(again late I know) but this time we had no problem getting seats. Our problem was with the service. Our actual waitress didn't start serving us until AFTER our food had arrived. A waitress from a different section noticed us and helped us out until our waitress finally showed up. We didn't get refills until we had to stop someone to ask for them which shouldn't have been that hard when there honestly weren't more than four other groups there at the time. Again, it was disappointing.\n\n(01/13)The time before that experience I went with my parents and three friends. It was a busy Friday night but we didn't have to wait long to get a table. The service was great but the annoying part was that every table but ours in the room claimed to be having a birthday. Literally every table. So we had to listen to their birthday song five times just in that one room while it went on in several other rooms. It ended up being very irritating and I honestly don't believe that everyone having a birthday in Charlotte that night would all go to Buca.\n\nOverall I really love Buca Di Beppo's food but the service has increasingly gone downhill since our first try in early 2012. Now when I go I see more problems than good experiences and honestly, I think the only way I'll be getting their food from now on is if I go with a large group early on in the day or through take out(which is usually cheaper).\n\nSorry Buca...but I think you deserve this one."
"1","I don't know what has happened to Buca.  I have eaten here many times in the past 5 years both with friends and with my church group for which I am the social coordinator.  I have gotten take out meals and only had great things to say about this restaurant in the past.  The food was and is still good but not worth the treatment one now receives as a guest. \n\n The wait staff had a total disregard and lack of respect for the patrons that was appalling.  Ours was poorly trained and had no back up or bus person.  Bread came out after the salad with no oil. By the time oil came, our bread was mostly gone.  We watched our desserts melt as we had neither spoons or plates to eat on.  I had dirty utensils dropped on me all while we froze to death after multiple requests to turn the air conditioning down.  After 4 requests a manager told us it had been done.  Within the hour it returned to meat locker status.  My church friends with arthritis were miserable and in pain due to the cold.  I had to go outside to try and warm up during my meal. I guess it was comfortable for the wait staff and those that may have been drinking alcohol.  For the rest it was a miserable an noisy environment.  It takes a lot for me to have to write this, but I was in tears thinking how my friend's Birthday celebration was ruined.  Needless to say  I will not be back nor will the groups I used to bring there."
"1","Came for Thanksgiving thought it would be nice for a change boy was I wrong made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time was supposed to get kitchen table didn't get it ! Then went to order gnocchi waiter brand new says they don't have ordered a Guinness beer says we have it be right back comes back like 15 minutes later to tell me they don't have.this place used to be good boy did it go down hill ! So disappointed !"
"1","Originally left a bad reviw. Bur since then I was contacted by the district manager. You really seem to care about this restaurant's reputation. He said they're making improvements and that I should try it again. I told him I would and I will hold my review until I do that again. Everybody deserves a second chance."
"1","I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside, but after years of business, I finally decided to try it out with some friends who were celebrating a new job. \n\nBread and drinks were promptly brought to the table, along with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We decided to start with the mixed green salad, and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens, I think of mesclun, arugala, frissae, and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant, I don't understand why they considered this salad \""mixed greens\"". The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish, we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind, as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh, and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor. It just wasn't as authentic as I was hoping for. \n\nService was fine, but I think I'll be skipping Buca next time I need a fix for Italian."
"2","My niece selected Buca for her birthday meal, so we were happy to take her. We took the tour through the kitchen on the way to our table, nice touch. Our waitress was super friendly and willing to answers our questions patiently.\n\nFamily style dining is fun, probably more so with a larger group to share with. We ordered a side dish of Alfredo for our niece because she couldn't eat a whole dish alone and neither my husband or I care for Alfredo ourselves. We decided to share the Quattro al Forno with ravioli, canneloni, manicotti and stuffed shells. We ordered a small, which states it is for 2-3 people to share. Hmm. Not sure I am buying that. It was a pretty small portion in my opinion for the money and the price. It was good, but not great. Chicken canneloni was my favorite.  The hubby ordered a meatball on the side and while it was big, he said it lacked the ooomph he was hoping for. Bummer.\n\nWe would go back with a group, but probably not on our own. I rounded up a 3.5 trip due to the great staff and eclectic atmosphere."
"1","They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. \n\nWhen I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \""sure\"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant."
"2","Love this place! Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Mmm table bread, Mountain Dew, & Caesar Salads!!"
"1","If the idea of awkwardly taking a tour of the kitchen followed by a maze through overrated Italian singers only to be led to a picnic table of the worst food ever... You are in for a good time.  DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. \n\nThis place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad"
"1","I was less than impressed. The meatballs were greasy and very bland. The price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive. Based on the reviews I was excited to try, but I will stick to Olive Garden or even Stouffers lasagna."
"1","Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks \""I use cooks loosely\"".\nI would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"
"2","Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this."
"1","Went there on 10/22/14. Service was nice. Server was nice but so ditsy. Ordered bruschetta. Came out fast, but entr\u00e9e's came out 50 mins later. Ordered eggplant parmigiana. Tasted burned. Waitress took my credit card and we waited almost 10 minutes for our credit card slip and she was so unorganized."
"1","The food here is subpar, at best. When we asked for a kids cheese pizza, they basically smeared some tomato sauce on a tortilla, sprinkled a few strings of shredded cheese on it and, with the way the cheese barely looked melted, I'd estimate they'd popped it in the microwave for maybe 30 seconds. It's a shame the food is so bad though because the decor is fantastic and, getting to take a tour of the kitchen before you eat is something you definitely don't experience everywhere. At least you know that, even if the final dish doesn't taste that great, it came from a clean kitchen."
"1","Went in for the Thanksgiving Day meal that they offer.  They indicate the two options are for 3 or 6 people.  We had 4 so chose the the meal that feeds 6 to take back leftovers.  Unfortunately they provided for for 4 people, even only brought out 4 pieces of pie for desert.  After getting about one spoon of dressing we asked for extra and were charged for it!  We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering the food that did not arrive until we were half way done eating.  Service wasn't that great either, had to ask for things twice before getting the.\n\nNeedless to say, after ordering and paying for a dinner that is supposed to feed 6, we brought nothing home.  It was my parents, uncle and myself, not exactly a group that should go through a Thanksgiving meal that is supposed to feed 6.\n\nThis place may be worth the money for the regular menu (never been there for that though) but felt cheated on this TG meal."
"2","I love Bi-Lo Butts......Pork Butts that is, just for my own Famous BBQ.\n\nI am not a big fan of Bi-Lo, but when it comes to friends and family wanting the absolute best BBQ, it must come from here.....\n\nHere's why:\nThey offer the correct sizes needed to feed a small army, with just the right amount of fat content to slow cook this bad butt into a wonderful piece of food art.\n\nBi-Lo prices are much better than the competitors and seem to offer this piece of meat on specials a little more frequently than others.\n\nThe service is friendly, but again, I only shop here for the butts.\n\nI find that they do offer a good variety of meats and other goods, but the butts are hands down the best value.  They do offer a butcher on site if needed for any choice cuts you may need.\n\nNCFoodGuy"
"1","Unless you have no other choice do not shop here.  The store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then Harris Teeter.  If you come after 10 you can hang out with the manager smoking outside (That's where he always is) or you can buy out of date bakery products.  If you question my review take a moment to go visit the men's bathroom.  It is disgusting and can be smelled 10 feet before you even get to the door."
"1","Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... But not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ..."
"1","Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... If you have a need for something specific - there's a good chance they will be out of it or have discontinued carrying it ... This place is not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...  Also watch the cashiers - famous for over charges and not giving credit for coupons even after they're mentioned to them ... Most definitely pay attention to your charges !"
"1","The K (Big, Super or Regular) is the place where retail dreams go to die.\n\nAt many other establishments, if you need to return something sans receipt, they might give you a hard time, but they will at least courteously tell you that you'll have to pay a reduced price based on the lowest selling price over the last few weeks. And more importantly, they tell you that UP FRONT. At the K - hopefully no relation to the Bruces we know and love here in Crown Town - you have to provide identification, address and phone number before they will even tell you what you can get for your marked-down merch. Then you get to walk about in a daze in the hopes that you can find something else to buy. Or you could donate the card to the needy and let them deal with the problem.\n\nShould you decide to walk the aisles of the damned, you are not treated to the relatively bright and well-lit or recently remodeled stores of any other establishment that wants to attract customers. No, here they buy outdated flat screens to seem that they are keeping with the times and hang them from the ceiling. Monitor stands and all. No fancy boxes, just a computer monitor hanging from above. Not even turned on. Really? Had I happened by prior to the holidays, that gift card would have made its way to the red kettle out front - if they would have accepted it."
"1","I wanted to bring some snacks back to Canada with me that we can't there. K-mart wouldn't be my first choice, but it was right across the street from my hotel so convenience was the factor here. The store wasn't busy, yet it didn't seem to be in the most organized state. Overall, the look of the store just seems to be tired.\n\nThe cashiers were friendly, but other than a couple of employees stocking shelves the store seemed to be a bit of a ghost town."
"1","Seriously I waited in the drive thru for like 10 minutes. Finally I actually called the store and asked if there was a problem. The manager was like no why? So I explained that we had all been sitting there for forever and I was trapped in the drive thru and couldn't get out and could he please start taking orders. His response was oh sorry I accidentally turned my headset off go ahead with your order. (I was 3 cars away).  Anyways I got my usual cantina bowl and it was okay... not great even by Taco Bell standards."
"1","I'm stuck between TWO and THREE stars. After all it is Taco Bell. \n\nYou can usually count on them for cheap and fast food. The cheap part is always standard. But, the fast part for this location has struggled for a while. I mainly visit this location for weekday work time lunch breaks (12 or 1 pm.)\n\nMaybe I should give them some slack because most places are slammed around this same time, but I feel they could step it up a bit and decrease the wait time a little.\n\nAlthough, I do really have zero complaints on the food. After all it is Taco Bell."
"1","i ordered a piece of furniture from havertys in April for Delivery in June.  When the piece was delivered it was damaged, which is fine but the way they handled the situation was far from professional.  i was initially told i'd have to wait another month to get the piece then i was informed that i'd recieve it a week later.  Prior to delivery i was told there had been an error and the only piece they had left was damaged.\n\nwe reached out to another haverty's asking about their floor unit asking if they were able to sell that similarly to how the other store had, they declined.  On 7/4 I cancelled my order, went to a competitor and ordered furniture to fill two rooms in my new home.  \n\nmy issue here is that my cancellation and payment was apparently never issued, i spoke with Haverty's on Friday asking about the status of my refund, they advised me to call in Monday so i did and they said it was never processed.  i finally got in touch with someone to process my refund on Monday.\n\nOverall this was a very poor experience, my salesperson was great and i liked the products offered, but i would never deal with this company just given the situation which was triggered by one individual issue."
"1","Ah yes...time again for some new living room furniture.  After getting new sofas every couple of years, we decided to give some leather furniture a try.\n\nWe found a couple of beautiful pieces and got a quote from our salesperson, Jeff.  We thanked him and went to check out some competitors' options to compare.  I'm not a huge fan of the all-day shopping events, and my preference was for the Haverty's pieces, so I decided to go back and see if Jeff could knock off the shipping charges to keep the price around 3 grand.\n\nHe looked incredibly annoyed (and why wouldn't he...it eats into his commission).  He had to \""speak with someone\"" about getting the price down.  He also asked if I would buy today if he could get the price of the shipping knocked off.  Which of course, led to my belief that I'd be pulling out my wallet in a couple of minutes.\n\nHere's where my decision to find a new store, or at the very least, work with another salesperson comes into play.  When speaking with Jeff, I expressed that I wanted to stay around or under 3 grand to stay within my budget...that...and...my wife wasn't exactly thrilled about purchasing a leather set to begin with.\n\nAnnoyed that I was asking for \""free shipping\"" ($120) on a $3,000 purchase, Jeff decides that the best thing to tell me...is...that I should have been looking at furniture I can afford.  Did he really just say that?  There's no way I heard that, right?\n\nNow there's two sides to me...the one that could have handed him my business card and discussed the difference between the words \""budget\"" and \""afford,\"" and the one that was in total shock as he walked away to talk to a manager.\n\nWhile my nature tends to lean towards the former, I was certain that any discussion past this point would have been a waste of breath.\n\nTo be fair, i was already receiving a $100 discount for every thousand I spent (not including the $300 warranty).  Since the price only came to $2700 without taxes and warranty, it would only be $200 off. \n\nI walked in to speak with Jeff for a deal on shipping.  I was prepared to leave and buy elsewhere if he was unwilling to negotiate.  \n\nThe only reason I'm updating my review is to bring light to a poor choice of how to speak to a customer and an unwillingness to be flexible.  \n\nProfit margin is considerably higher in the furniture business than in most other retail outlets.  As a returning customer I expect some flexibility in maintaining the relationship.  Acting like the $120 delivery charge would bring the net profit below all costs was absurd...and if it's not absurd...Haverty's business model must be."
"1","Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive (menu on-line)\n\nIt was clean and the service was good but, the food was medicore at best. If you can't have a great cheeseburger at a steak house then you have problems."
"1","Maybe I'm spoiled by the Longhorn near my house, which is always good...\n\nWhen I arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday evening, I was treated as if the restaurant was about to close.  The hostess was very short with me and my date.  She walked us to a table, dropped the menus, and walked away.\n\nThe server (never told us his name) came by the table and got our drink order.  No personality and didn't make us feel welcome.  We ordered eventually.  No personality, still.  (Are they closing soon?)\n\nDinner arrived and my steak didn't taste right.  My date didn't like her steak either.  The manager came by and offered next to nothing to make things right.  I eventually requested some A1 and dowsed my steak in that.\n\nThe best part of dinner was the sweet tea."
"1","C'mon folks, w/all the great places to get a steak in the Charlotte area, from Longhorn pricing to high dollar steaks elsewhere, why is ANYONE going to Longhorn??...its never been more than an \""OK\"" steakhouse at its best, and that locations glory days, so to speak, have been in its rearview mirror for probably 5+ years....."
"1","i used to work at this location in high school - back then it was great food and a fun atmosphere. Things have really slipped since then though. They drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese....  I thought it was supposed to be a healthy dish (?)....\nMy sweet tea wasn't sweet at all, which was UBER disappointing for me because I hadn't had sweet tea in 8 months because I moved up north...\nMy soup was alright - French Onion - pretty standard. \nMy friend enjoyed his meal though so that was cool. But he wanted to satisfy a sweet tooth after his lunch and the server never suggested desert. He suggested everything else that we ddin't want but I guess he just gave up and figured we wouldn't want it anyway. \nNothing great and I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again..."
"2","Prior to this visit , I was a Longhorn virgin.  So to be fair, this review is based only on my very first visit which was good and I'd go back if I could press replay on this visit.\nThat being said, I am surprised by the low rating here. \n\nThree of us shared the Texas onion (similar to OB bloomin onion) but we liked this version better.Wild west shrimp was also shared. Cherry peppers gave it a nice zing.\n\nSalads that came with the entrees were fresh and big. Had we known it came already dressed, we would have asked for it on the side.But it was a perfect amount anyway.\n\nI had the porterhouse, great, cooked the way I like it. Nice tender ,flavorful. Mashed taters were good.\n\nFriend had filet (7oz.) again, tender,cooked the way requested, good. Served with giant loaded baked potato.\n\nLast dish was a new menu item ( I don't know how new, like I said this was my first visit.)Parmesan crusted chicken . \nMenu states \"" two juicy chicken breasts grilled and topped with parmesan cheese and garlic crust.\"" Surprisingly, It was described just as it was served. She enjoyed it!\n\nService was great ! So much to the fact when the manager came over to check in and see if we enjoyed our dinner , I made a point to compliment the excellent service.( I'm sure the verbal compliment was just the icing on the cake. The real compliment was the nice tip I left !\n\nI'm not sure if they have a lunch menu But I did notice the dessert menu.None of us had room for dessert.\n\nThe place is big and looked as if it had a private dining spot.\n\nListen, I am not a steak house aficionado.But based on this visit, I like Longhorn chain better then O.B and L.S."
"1","We like Longhorn, but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar, 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.\n\nWorst experience in a long time."
"1","I wouldn't be so quick to hand out only one star, but after much consideration, I can't give this place any more. My wife and I went on a Thursday night. The place was less than half full, yet the hostess had us wait between 5-10 minutes for them to clean a table before seating us. Seems kind of asinine when there are plenty of empty seats throughout the restaurant. I understand that due to staffing they may have wanted to sit us in a particular server's section, but I believe customer service is all about perception. Our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag. My wife enjoyed her LongHorn Salmon, but my Renegade Top Sirloin was ruined by being served completely drenched in oil. I've eaten at Longhorn in Maine a couple of times, and don't remember their steaks being served this way. If this is normal here, then I much prefer the steaks at Texas Roadhouse for this price range. My lobster tail was good, and not overcooked. For dessert, my wife and I shared a Caramel Apple Goldrush. This was most excellent, and almost warranted an extra star.\n\nThe main reason for the one star is what happened after our visit. I had left a $10 cash tip, and filled out the credit card slip to reflect this. A few days later, when the charge showed up on my credit card statement, I found that an additional $10 had been added. I immediately went back to the restaurant and spoke very cordially with a manager, showing him the receipt for my visit and my credit card statement. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how a business handles a customer after a mistake is made that sets the tone for future business. The first thing he did, after researching the error in the back, is offer a $10 coupon. That is not acceptable to me, because to take advantage of this, I'd have to eat here again. He asked me what he should do (isn't HE the manager?), and I suggested that he credit the overcharge back to my card, or void/refund the full amount, and recharge it. I was told that I'd have to fill out a form that would have to be faxed to corporate, then I'd have to wait an unknown number of days to see the amount credited back to my card. I understand that there may be corporate policies that he has to follow, but there seemed to be very little compassion or empathy on his part. He should have still offered the coupon or maybe a comp'd entr\u00e9e for the trouble of driving all the way back to the store because of a pretty significant error one of their employees made. No such luck. I would not have necessarily accepted the offer, but the gesture would definitely be appreciated and goes a long way towards a customers' perceptions about how important they are to a business. I do have a background in customer service management, and this would have never flown under my watch.\n\nMy wife and I have never been disappointed at Texas Roadhouse in Matthews, where the staff has always been enthusiastic and the food is exactly what we expect at this style of restaurant. I guess we'll stick with that when we're in the mood for a slab of beef and all the fixin's."
"1","Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \""two of us, but is there a wait??\"" She responds, \""yes at least 10-15 minutes\"".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."
"2","Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.\n\nI had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  Classic exterior and very nice interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas, which would be great for a company function or family dinner.\n\nPersonally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality.  I think their grilled chicken is the best anywhere.  Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price.\n\nDefinitely will be returning to this location."
"2","Great steaks for the price. Always good service. Don't get me wrong, they aren't the greatest steak place. But the best in the affordable/causal range."
"1","This used to be my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  It's really gone downhill lately.  The last 2 times I've eaten here the prime rib was still cold.  I told the waiter to take it back and cook it some more.  He brought it back STILL COLD.  I realize prime rib is best rare, but this guy just didn't get it.  Nice waitresses and free peanuts though."
"2","Love this place. Eat here once a week. Great food staff and the place is clean. 5 star because there is nothing negative that you can say."
"1","The meal was good.  The usual, chain steakhouse quality. ... except the 18 oz rib eye came with a 5 oz bone in it.....Typically the servers are at least attentive at the longhorn.  Today our server would have preferred she didn't have people to wait on.  The restaurant wasn't busy but getting a new drink was almost impossible....and you better be satisfied with the old mug cause getting a new frosty mug with the 2nd beer was not going to happen."
"1","They get two for the great service but everything else was not so good. I had a ribeye which was cooked to the right temperature. It was seasoned with a TON of salt and a pound of butter. Sweet potato also had too much butter. My gf got the lobster chops the lobster was overcooked and tough to get out of the shell. It should be easy when it comes split already right? Her corn on the cob was undercooked. So all in all the service is good but the food sucks. We will not be coming back again."
"2","Consistency is what I like about Long Horn. Still the best place for a steak under $25 anywhere. Even their sirloins are great and you can mostly cut with a fork. The Filets you can always cut with a fork.  A dash of salt and pepper is all I ever need to put on their steaks.\n\nThe salads at Long Horn, this is where they need to step up their game. Let's do something other than ice berg lettuce guys!"
"1","We got here a little before 5 PM hoping to beat the crowd and not have to wait to be seated-The place was empty except for the 5 or 6 parties ahead of us in the waiting area who made the same mistake-We were expected to happily wait until 5 when more servers would start work-We left.Don't pretend to be open and not be ready to serve hungry customers!I like the food here and think it's a pretty good value for the $60 or so we spend for the two of us,but there's lots of other places to spend that money-"
"2","Service was still excellent, I ordered the outlaw ribeye my gf ordered the salmon. Both were cooked perfect and my steak was seasoned perfect. Thank you to the staff for giving us the gift card. We will deffinetly be back in the future. It must have been an off night before."
"1","The meal was Filet, with asparagus and salad though right now I am not eating oil of any kind so the salad was not an option - I opted for the grilled shrimp instead ... Steak was delicious - the asparagus was cooked to death and worn out and the grilled shrimp was good though the manager wanted no part of offering any consideration of discount for the salad I didn't order ... \nLong story short - go to Outback Steakhouse right around the corner and get treated remarkable and get food you want with no hassles mate ! \nWon't make this mistake again - too many choices in Charlotte to have to dicker over $6.00 !  Outback would not only have accommodated my request but would have checked to make sure I was happy ... \nLonghorn was NOT crowded - hum. ... Probably why ... Carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !"
"1","9/7/2014 Went here for late lunch with a friend after running errands near the mall. I've been here at this location a few times before with great results. Today not so much. Our server Jeff was the worst waitstaff I've encountered in many years.\n\ncould never find him, and when we did was having conversation with other female employee. had to get up and find my own pepper mill that had something in it. had to ask the hostess several times for assistance. \n\n15 minutes after order our salads come, I needed more dressing so we had to search him out in the place because we couldn't see him anywhere fro over 5 minutes. \nafter 45 MORE minutes our meals came. \n\nI ordered the parmesan crusted ribeye, med rare and the French onion soup. she ordered the ribeye as well and I don't remember what side. \n\nmy steak was cool (not cold) and over done to a medium ALSO the cheese on my soup had solidified! so this tells me that our meals SAT in the back so long they got cold. my friends meal was also cool - all of it!\n\nShe said NOTHING but by now I am pissed off, the guy never refilled our drinks - we had to ask for others to get it and by the time he remembered we had probably needed a refill we were already done drinking half of what the last person we begged for liquid from gave us. \n\nI told the hostess that this guy needs a lot more training because he is the worse server I have ever come across, I FIRED servers who weren't this bad when I was a head waitress for 2 years!\n\nthe only reason WHY this place got 2 stars is because of the manager (Alberto I think his name was) came over and I showed him my meal, told him of all the issues we had, but what I was most disappointed with is the obvious WAIT time to get the cold food- which was NOT the kitchens fault. \nHe personally promised to go cook my steak himself (he said it just takes 8 minutes!) WOW then Jeff should explain the 45 minutes we waited for our 8 minute steaks. (keep in mind there was only about 4 tables occupied, including ours, in the whole place)\n\nfinally finished our meals and we would've left $1 tip instead of the $5 bill, but that was the smallest bill we had and we had to leave. And this arrogant little dude is going to come over and start making excuses to us? says he was doing all he could to help us? that he didn't know there was a problem? that he had been there 3 months and never had a complaint? (well the manager said he had been there 1 month- I believe the manager) and maybe SO JEFF no one complained- ya know what most PEPLE DONT- they just DON'T come back!"
"2","very nice store. the selections are fairly good for all types of animals. they at ban field vets have a traveling aviary doctor which was a little inconvenient seeing as I needed one that day.\nthe bird toys are slim for large birds. the bird foods and treats selections is very good. I like the dog treat section also they have a much better variety than the average grocery store or wal mart. one of my dogs is a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs 3lbs she is no bigger than a can of soda with legs and has very few teeth. the training rewards treats are perfect for her tiny mouth and soft enough for her to chew.\n\nI have walked around the store some and all areas have a good variety to choose from no matter what you are looking for.\n I love that I can take my animals in the store. the staff has always been very attentive and friendly"
"1","Closed, and has been for a long time now.  Last visit garnered a first bucket of stale peanuts which the waitress knew we were going to say yet served them anyway before providing more.  An average steakhouse."
"1","Closed for business"
"2","After seeing myriad commercials and advertisements everywhere for the new JCP, I decided to pay them a visit.  It has been many, many, many years since I have even set foot in JCP.  I had not even given them a thought.  However, it is a new year and times have changed.  My visit netted quite a few items for my girls, not so much for myself.  Shopping on a Friday evening after work is, in fact, hard work.  The staff members were very nice and all of them greeted me cheerfully.\n\nI ended up shopping online and found a couple items that I am quite pleased with.  I will say that many items were out of stock online; this is a clear indication that JCP has ramped up their merchandise quality and many haven taken notice and are reaping the benefits.  Shop JCP online to take your time viewing the merchandise.  If you are up to it, shop the store.  The 1st and 3rd Friday sales are on limited items that are on clearance."
"2","I used the ship to store feature on the website to get free shipping since the mall is really close to my house. It was quick and easy, and definitely better than trying to fight people for product in the store. \n\nI didn't quite understand where I could pick up my order, so since it was shoes I walked to that section to ask. The girl at the front was really friendly and she called up to the receiving department who brought down my shoes. I checked to see that 1. it was the correct shoe and 2. that they were the correct size. Both were true, so she printed me a receipt, and I signed that I received the merchandise, then I was on my way! \n\nVery pleasant experience and definitely worth it to save $8."
"1","I would not recommend going to this Best Buy location. I recently purchased a big screen tv there and had the worst experience a consumer could have. I originally found a tv at their Rivergate location and they did not have any in stock so I went to Pinevill. When I arrived I was one of maybe four people in the store and no one would assist me. After waiting for twenty minutes I went to customer service where I waited another five minutes. Then customer service wouldnt help me. I knew the tv, model number and every other information and they still would not help. So they said they had to page  someone. After waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came. Lets put it this way..... he treated me like I cut his break short or whatever he was doing out back. He barely said only one word to me, put the tv in the computer, rang me up and thats it. The only time he was slightly pleasant was when he tried to upsell me and I politely said no thank you. Then he went back to his original way. He handed me a receipt and said go up front to the guy in the blue shirt, and walked away. No thank you or thanks for you patience. So i went up front and waited for another few minutes for help. The guy from up front arrived, gave him my receipt and then waited another 20 minutes for the tv. Guess who brought it out.... the original guy. He put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away. Again, no thank you, have a nice day, nothing..... My question is if he walked away from me as soon as I purchased it and went to the back, why did it take 20 minutes to get the tv. He knew the guy in the front would be calling it in. I also am baffled  in this economy a consumer who is buying an expensive product at a store is not even mildly appreciated. I am the last one to usually complain about service because we all have our bad days but this store in whole must of had a bad day. I really have to blame it on management. I seriously had to bite my tongue on this one. The Rivergate location was wonderful however, they just unfortunately did not have the tv I wanted in stock."
"1","Absolutely horrible customer service!  The worst Best Buy I have ever visited.  My family shops at Best Buy from Wilmington to Johnson City and this is by far the worst place we have ever been.  I don't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once, not twice but three times.  It started last year when I purchased a new laptop to replace my 4 yr old one (which I also bought at Best Buy).  The Geek squad did not listen to my concerns and wiped my old laptop clean WITHOUT contacting me as they stated they would.  I lost a lot of important information!  Then stating that both my computers were ready (while contacting the wrong person over and over again).  When we went to pick them up they were not ready, and this happened 3 times.  Back and forth a total waste of time. THEN guess what happens a year later, THE SAME THING!! After having to wait for 45 mins for them to even find me in their system (I had spent the extra money on the one year plan-which they magically couldn't find 6 months later).  Still no contact to pick up my computer 7 days later, after they stated it was ready and guess what happened after i drove out of my way, it wasn't! Their response \""Oh, huh I don't know what happened there!\"" not even an apology. Called again 3 days later to check and oh all of a sudden it was ready just that second.  Only to find out that it wasn't installed properly BY THE GEEK SQUAD to begin with which is why it messed up. Total lack of respect for customers and total idiots that obviously cannot read directions and dial a phone number correctly!"
"2","Finding myself in need of a wireless router soon (going from AT&T U-Verse back to TWC because of moving - AT&T supplies wireless router, TWC charges you $15/mo. !?)., after a stop at The Home Depot located in the same shopping center, across from Carolina Place Mall, I thought I would check out Best Buy and see if they had what I needed.\n\nI am typically an amazon girl, and I avoid going places to shop if at all possible (even though my job is the design of big box retailers).  This stop was more of a \""it's a pretty nice day out, I need to walk off lunch, oh look, there's Best Buy\"".   \n\nUpon walking into the store (clean, typical Best Buy footprint), there was a young lady in the middle of the aisle who appeared to be there to help direct traffic.  I said \""wireless router?\"", she pointed and said \""computers are straight back\"", so straight back I went.  As I know what a router looks like, I wandered the aisles until I found them, it only took a second.  There were a few employees in the computer section, but I didn't necessarily need assistance so I just started to look at prices and read boxes.  I had done some research online and pretty much knew what I was looking for.  Once I found the Netgear router, and saw the price, I used my handy dandy amazon price check app on my phone to compare and found that the router was the same price on amazon as it was at Best Buy.  SOLD!  I randomly ran the price check on the 2 \""better\"" models of the router that I had in my hand and found the prices to be exactly the same as amazon.  Competitive pricing is what it's all about.  \n\nFor a Sunday just after church, they were well enough staffed.  I walked straight up to a young lady at the checkout who was friendly and efficient and I chit-chatted with her as I dug through my wallet looking for my debit card.   I have very limited patience for shopping, so this visit was a great experience."
"1","Waiting in line no one here....3 employees standing around and no one says anything. Horrible service. Next time ill just order on amazon"
"2","I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm, fresh and tasty.\n\nNext I thought I would try one of their Green Mountain coffees - the Island Coconut flavor.  I know what your thinking but stop right there .... give it a whirl.  Wow it is good!  I got so excited about it I craved it for a whole week.\n\nIts such a nice change to a greasy fried breakfast.  I'm glad I went and I will be back!"
"1","Cream cheese skimp alert!! We pay ~$7 per smoked salmon bagel and they put the cream cheese on like people butter their toast. They have no clue what the word \""toasted\"" means. It really is just warming the bagel. The lox bagels are not even made open face. Not going back again."
"2","Admittedly, the grump factor is high in some of my Yelp reviews.  In my defense, that's because my priority when reading others' reviews is to take note of the bad places and avoid them and I try to return the favor.\n\nThat said, I'm happy to click five stars for this location and would give them a sixth if I could.  Unfailingly helpful, polite, friendly and efficient, the crew lineup at this store has been remarkably stable - it makes one confident of getting the same excellent product and service regardless of the day of the week and despite the brutal early morning hours including weekends.  They are never shorthanded.\n\nThe bagels themselves are unmatched in the local market and in the Bruegger's chain overall.  The whole 'thank you baker' routine is a bit contrived but this one deserves the gratitude from staff and customers alike.\n\nI'm not crazy about have to stand in a queue to get a quick bag of bagels and a to-go coffee waiting for others to place intricate eat-in orders but that's generally a problem only on the weekends.\n\nThis location has the self-serve coffee bar which also saves time and headaches for all.\n\nI'm roughly equidistant from a few Bruegger's locations.  I occasionally visit other locations and am consistently disappointed, especially in the Park Road store (see other review). I'm a slow learner, I suppose, but grateful that one location does it right."
"2","Great value. I think this will become a regular place for me. Rebecca was great! I loved the long massage, and paraffin wax treatment, which I never got in any swanky Ballantyne/Southpark basic pedi that costs $20 more. The place is not fancy, but their service is outstanding. My one small complaint was that the chair was well-used and maybe not the most comfortable, but the massage feature worked just fine!"
"2","BEST NAIL EXPERIENCE EVER!!! With nail salons, I usually experience friendly, but not great work or excellent work and not too friendly or a little bit of both , but not a great atmosphere! This encompassed all 3! The paraffin (no extra charge), large massage chair, very attentive and detailed pedicure, affordable pricing  and the exceptionally friendly service made the experience 5 stars! This will be the only salon I use for for mani, pedi and waxing. A little bit hard to find (across from Carolina place mall on 51, in the K-mart/Best Buy strip mall).. GO NOW!"
"2","My toes look GREAT, the staff is super nice! This is my first visit....I decided to join my friend (it's her Birthday) Personally I only visit nail salons that use Tub liners, which this place doesn't....so my search will continue."
"1","Not the best or the worst mall in Charlotte. I'm the in and out type of guy - go straight to correct store, shop and get back to car/drive back home. In that perspective, Carolina Mall works.\n\nFor a fuller mall feel, I Concord Mills Mall and others better than this one."
"2","I love this mall!!\n\nIt's not overwhelming and always packed like Concord Mills and it has stores that everyone can shop in...like Belk and JC Penny's all of my other favorites stores like Bath and Body Works, NY and Company, Express...the list goes on and on...It's always clean and I rarely have trouble finding parking. Right off the highway which is a huge plus in my book but another reason this mall is so great is the location... it's surrounded by really good restaurants, like Harpers, Red Lobster, Olive Garden.\n\nI'm really a fan and I would recommend my friends and family to this mall."
"2","My favorite mall in the Queen City area. It has a down to earth vibe to it. A great mall because it's really never packed."
"1","ALERT TO PARENTS AND SHOPPERS OF CAROLINA PLACE MALL:  One of the employees of the massage parlor (Oasis) next to the kid's play area was caught inconspicuously taking pictures of my 4 yr. old daughter while she was playing there.  Even though it is private property, the General Manager of the Carolina Place will not ban him from working at the mall because it is not against the law to take pictures of little girls.  The police report number is 121005-2147."
"1","Santa Claus here sucks!  They wouldn't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down.  They just shooed us along and wouldn't even try to help calm our kid down.  \n\nHow disappointing it is that these people are charging an arm and leg for these pictures but will not even attempt to settle a child down or get them acclimated to a stranger with a long beard! \n\n\nI will not be back to see year people again!\n\nI"
"1","Gave this mall yet another try again today, disappointed again.  Easily second fiddle to any other mall in the area.  All the regular stores, plus some of the more trashy ones.  And watch out for the security nazis, same jerk came by twice in 6 min to tell my 3 kids to calm down, and we were outside the mall!?!  I figured outside was the best place for my kids to run & play while we waited for the stores to open.  Will continue to go to SouthPark of all my mall needs."
"2","Love shopping at this mall.... Very affordable especially during the holiday season! Just be careful shopping on the weekends! It can get VERY crazy!!!!!"
"1","Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok, the service can ruin the meal and experience! \n\nThat being said my coworker and I stopped into Applebee's for the Pick n' Pair lunch special. The hostess sat us at our table with no greeting and lucky for us she was our waitress as well...sarcasm intended and required. \n\nShe took our drink order walked away several minutes later she returned with our drinks...asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we placed our ordered. I chose the Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup. \n\nNow, I don't know how long it takes to put soup in the bowl and throw some salad on a plate but with maybe two other tables occupied and it being late in the afternoon it certainly doesn't take half my lunch hour. And for those of us who try to leave the office for some peace of mind and freedom during the workday...when you are on your lunch hour every moment counts.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived with the few moments we had left on a lunch break. I scarfed it down I think it tasted ok. From what I remember, the salad was spicy and the jalapeno dressing was yummy! The chicken tortilla soup was just ok. It could have used a few more pieces of chicken and spice to take it up a notch. \n\nOverall, the experience was horrible. The service was horrible. The food was ok. I won't be running back to this location any time soon."
"2","My intention was to get back to Sweet Tea's today, but they are closed on Sundays. So, being in that area, my Mother wanted the Chinese Chicken Salad at Applebee's, one of her all time favorites. Not being a true fan of chains, I agreed. And, I was very impressed. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and fresh! I also really enjoyed their seasoned fries. My Mom enjoyed her salad as well, and the staff was attentive throughout the entire meal. Shocked, yes, but happy I said yes."
"1","I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!"
"1","Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me \"" it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants\"". I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen. \nI contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there, very friendly and easy to work with, called back was very impressed."
"2","If you are heading to Carolina Place, this is the entrance I choose. \n\nThe parking is adequate, you do not have to worry about trying to beat the other crazy shopper for that one last parking spot in front of the food court,  and since it is at the end of the mall, I could always use the extra exercise. Afterall, I am eating at all these places I am Yelping about, and appear to be yelping on myself in the meantime.\n\nNow, back to Dillard's, It is a staple to Charlotte, and is a viable competitor to Belk's,  Macy's and dare I say Nordstrom's.\n\nThe Men's Dept is where I usually shop, (not saying that I shop in the Women's section) but I am at that crucial XXL vs. the Big & Fat (B&F) Selection. This does not have the (B&F) area like Southpark, and I usually find a few better deals at the Dillard's Southpark Store in the B&F Section.  No offense to big people.....I wear a 3XL.\n\nWith that being said, the shoe selection is nice, although my last Timberland's only made it three months......(must be all the footwork to the Yelping), but they do have a nice variety and the prices are reasonable.\n\nThe staff is friendly, and just an FYI, ever time I go there, I see the Pineville Police doing security, so you can feel much safer than at any other mall.\n\nNCFoodGuy"
"1","Absolutely the worst customer service of any retail store I've ever experienced. No matter what city/state, it never fails."
"2","I don't know of any other jeweler with a loyalty or marketing program like Helzberg. My husband bought me a ring for graduation a couple years ago and some jewelry on special occasions from Helzberg. Since those purchases, his name has been on their list and for our anniversary and my birthday, they have sent us cards with a free gift (have to go to store to pick up). Talk about speaking my love language! This is definitely a relationship with benefits!\n\nWe've been into this particular location a few times and each time we have been met by friendly sales associates. They haven't ever pressured us to buy anything and believe me I have been known to \""window shop\"" the jewelry cases planning my next big purchase. \n\nI've purchased other significant pieces of jewelry (e.g., husband's wedding band) at other high end jewelers and I've never received a card from them...they should take note of Helzberg and follow suit. Definitely when it comes to customer service and above-and-beyond satisfaction, Helzberg has it down!"
"1","We decided to start our wedding band search for both Kevin and me and this was the first jeweler we stopped at.  Gary approached us asking what we were looking for, and I told him both rings.  He showed me a few of the rings that might look good with my ring, and there was one that I liked.  He asked if he could write it up for puchase, I said no, we were just starting our search and wanted to see what was out there.  We then asked him about the men's rings, and pointed us over to men's, not showing us or giving us information on rings.  So we were back on our own.\n\nWe spent a few moments looking at the men's wedding bands when we were approached by another sales person, but we turned them away just saying we were looking.  Shortly after, another lady comes over.  Kevin didn't want the help, but I asked her anyways.  Amber was a huge delight.  She showed us the different kinds of rings and tolds us the different information on the rings.  She asked us if we wanted her to write down the information on a card so we would know which ones we were interested in.  She even went back to mine to write that down, and showed me another ring she thought would match, and it did, better than the one Gary showed us!  She was happy to help us and very friendly, even though we were just looking.  She was really the one that helped us moving forward and knowing what we wanted to look for at all the other stores.\n\nOne star for Gary and five for Amber.  We are not going to go back to purchase because we found ones that we loved more at another store and that were more for our budget."
"1","I went in here to get my engagement ring resized.  I was so upset on the possibility of giving my ring over to strangers and the possibility of not seeing it for a while!  The staff was wonderful, and even through computer difficulties, they were really nice.  The reasoning for my two star review is for one detail of my experience here.  \n\nMy fiance purchased this ring, as a surprise.  Clearly, I was never meant to know the price of this ring.  Maybe some people go pick out rings together, but I feel like mostly, grooms are picking these out for a surprise or gift etc...Well in order to get my specific ring resized they had to send it off and get an entirely different ring.  The same style etc, just a different ring that fit.  The cashier printed out the reciept and gave me a copy.  I felt very uncomfortable knowing the amount of my engagement ring and thought it to be a little classless.  Maybe this is a common practice that I am unaware of, but I did not like it.  I did enjoy the politeness and courtesy staff and overall thought this store had a great selection of products. Just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring!"
"1","I was very unimpressed with this Olive Garden location.  The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.\n\nSecondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.\n\nI also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location."
"1","I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all. \n\nOur server, Derek A. (tall, bald guy), was hopeless to say the least. He didn't mention any specials, didn't get us our drink refills in time and never offered any additional bread sticks or salad. Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)\n\nFood portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D\n\nAnyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience."
"1","Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. \n\nWe went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at, smelled so badly!!! I did not even want to put my purse down. The area smelled like throw up or smelly feet. This made my food experience not good. \n\nThe place is just older and needs some renovations. Please change your carpets!"
"1","The minute you step into this OG, you will get the stench of smelly socks. Very hard to un-notice the smell. Service was poor, the waitress was just trying to get rid of us ASAP, even though we went in at 8PM (not too late for dinner in my opinion). The place is not clean, the table we sat was sticky.\n\nFood was in par with the other OGs. Will I go there again ? nah for the amount of money I pay I would go some place else - that at the least doesnt smell.\n\nIm giving this two stars only for the food."
"1","You know what Olive Garden is and so do I.  Despite being far from authentic, I typically enjoy their food about once or twice a year.  This time we had a gift card, so that was incentive enough to go.  They currently have a 2 for $25 which is okay, but the portions are a lot smaller than their regular entrees.  Yes, you get unlimited salad and breadsticks, but it's just iceberg salad.  The deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share.  It was enough for the price, but they should mention the portions are reduced.  Contrary to LR's review, I have ALWAYS taken leftovers home from OG.  I easily ate the whole entree after eating salad and breadsticks.  Unless they just reduced their portion size since the last time I went, these were definitely skimpy and did not come with that much chicken either.  The smoked chicken was decent.\n\nOur friend got the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks for dinner (yes they offer it for dinner for $3 more) but our less than friendly waitress snagged 2 of her breadsticks off of the table before she was finished. Why would you snag breadsticks from right in front of someone in the first place, let alone someone who has them as part of their meal. The spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth.  \n\nAll in all, it's not that good and there are better places you could go and not have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Try a real, local Italian place, like Libretto's up the road or Portofino's on Park Rd.  Their dishes are made by real Italian people, not dreamed up in a corporate kitchen, and they give you your money's worth.  \n\nDrive 5 minutes to Libretto's for real Italian food or 10 minutes to The Carolina Bistro."
"1","My mother wanted to take my wife and I out to dinner for my wife's B-day, we were a party of eight, we were assigned two waitresses that had a difficult time getting on the same page. Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other \npatrons were given gift cards and comped bills."
"1","Want a zero star option! I am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible! Where do I start? Got soup without bread which came about 20 mins later as it was baking every time we would remind her although everyone around was getting baskets. Then Food ordered was new promos that had no details and had to rely on waitress which was clueless! She lied about the meal all together. Ended up with 2 meals un eaten. The bread finally arrived at end and lemon never came...she kept saying it was being cut! Ended with her dropping our plate on floor causing flying glass and never got a mint! Well at least she was smart enough to ask mgr to talk to us b4 us asking!"
"1","Most people are aware that OG is far far from authentic...however it seems that OG has gone downhill in recent years, and has left it up to a marketing team to save them. Upon our most recent visit to this OG in Pineville, They gave me food poisoning. Having worked in the restaurant business for 15 years, I am very aware of what food poisoning is and is not. This was the real deal..my first hint should have been at the restaurant when the couple seated next us were complaining about their food. I doubt we'll ever be back."
"1","I am not a fan of big corporate \""Italian-style\"" chain resturants, and the OG is one of my least favorites (behind Maggianos, Macaroni Grill, and Bucca di Bepo). I would never choose to go here over a locally owned place, but unfortunately, there are times that I find myself at one of these types of places for a work or social event planned by someone else.  \n\nThat is how I ended up at this OG location.  There were about 15 of us, and you would think a big corporate chain like OG would be well versed in serving large groups, but on this particular visit, the service was even worse than the food (which is not very good in my opinion).\n\nThe service was PAINFULLY slow and the server(s) kept forgetting to bring items to the table.  It took forever to get drinks to the the table.  Then,  I had ordered soup with unlimited salad & breadsticks... as did several folks at the table.  With so many eating salad, it was gone in no time and it took forever to get more to the table. A couple of people didn't get their entrees at the same time, so awkwardly sat at the table waiting for food.  \n\nThis attempt at lunch ended up taking  2+ hours - which is ok for a dinner event but completely unacceptable at lunch time when you have to get back to work.  The bad service coupled with the mediocre food just makes this place a big waste of time.  Next time someone plans an event here - lunch or dinner - I will just have to respectfully decline."
"1","Came here for lunch with my pops, who was fiending for their $6.95 soup/salad/breadsticks extravaganza. He is a huge fan of this deal, but unfortunately did NOT receive it, since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, and they only offer their lunch specials on WEEKDAYS.\n\nAnother slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty. It featured green onions, chives, sauteed spinach, and tasted pretty fresh, discounting the strong vinaigrette coating on the steak. My dad would have given this place four stars, but I am not my dad!"
"2","Oh Olive Garden...you really impressed me with your new menu options and I'm very happy to write this review!\n\nIt had been a while since I've visited and OG, mainly because I was tired of always ordering the same thing. But my parents were in town and wanted to stop in for dinner so I figured...why not?!?\n\nWe started with the Moscato, what I love about the wine here is that they always let you sample prior to ordering a glass and now they offer a glass and a half...whoooo hoooo! The Moscato is sweet, fruity and crisp! One of my absolute favorites!\n\nOur appetizer was the lasagna fritta which is Parmesan breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over Alfredo sauce topped with Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. I must say this was a very delicious way to start the meal! The fried pieces of lasagna were hot and crispy and the two sauces and cheese were a perfect compliment! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! \n\nWe also had the Zuppa Toscana which is spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy breath and salad. For the meals we had Tour di Mare which has three small portions of their creamy shrimp Alfredo, shrimp scampi fritta which are a new item of lightly fried shrimp tossed in a garlic and white wine sauce! They were very good the mix of favors offers a very unique taste! We also tried the Bucatini with meat sauce. The pasta is a little thicker that spaghetti noodles but equally delicious! \n\nOur server was outstanding and our food was delicious, I am absolutely looking forward to going back and trying some more of their new menu items!"
"2","I love this place because the pasta is always very very very hot."
"1","Let me start off by premising the fact that I was at the mall, I knew I could sit quickly at the bar and I had a gift card since christmas or I would not be eating at a chain restaurant. It was what you expect at all of the chains. I got chicken and shrimp carbonarra (spell check). It was fair. What does one expect for something quick and convenient to what I was doing at the time.  I do wish however that I spent the gift card next door just shoveling cheddar bays down my throat. Good talk."
"1","Until recently, I worked near the mall and a couple of weeks ago my wife and daughter decided to surprise me at work for a family lunch date and this OG was selected.  Biggest mistake ... ever.\n\nThe only positive part of the visit was the host/hostess station, who had their act together enough to seat us with minimal wait.  We then sat at the table for15 minutes before anyone resembling a waiter appeared.  When our waiter approached our table, he set down two menus and walked away without saying a single word or acknowledging us in any way.  We then waited another 10 minutes before he returned to take our drink AND meal order.\n\nAt this point, we were both upset but decided to give them a pass since it was a busy lunch rush on a Friday.  My wife and I both ordered coke and decided to get the all you can eat three pasta promotion and asked for our garlic bread and salad to be brought out before the meal.  \n\nWe then did not see our waiter again for 30 minutes when he appeared carrying our entire meal out on one tray - drinks and pasta - without salad or bread sticks.  We were visibly upset at this point, my lunch hour was now over, and we were just now getting our incomplete first round of our \""all you can eat\"" order.\n\nHe literally put the food down on the edge of the table without asking us who had which dish and disappeared again.  My wife had ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for her first dish. I am not exaggerating when I say that what she was brought was a bowl of cold linguini noodles with a glubbed-on ball of cold Alfredo sauce sitting in the center on top of the noodles.\n\nI never request to see the manager when the service is this poor because management is always the problem.  Incompetent management breeds the hiring of incompetent wait staff, so rather than make a scene I simply leave the restaurant.  If they care to stop me to try to insist I pay, well then game on.  No one stopped me.\n\nI returned to work with an empty stomach and placed yet another restaurant on my black list.  And we never did receive our salad and bread.\n\nOlive Garden - your food is not that good to begin with.  If you wish to stay in business, I suggest you visit stores for quality checks on a much more frequent basis - especially this location.  Just dreadfully awful.\n\nCheers!"
"1","Went here on Sunday. We don't usually go to chain restaurants, simply because there are so many delicious locally owned restaurants in the area. However, we had a gift card and decided to go have dinner. \n\nWe got there around 6 and had no wait for a table. However, when we left, there was alot of people in the lobby waiting for a seat.\n\nWe both ordered a glass of the house red. Well priced and very good for a house wine.\n\nI ordered the soup and salad with the pasta fagoli soup. My husband ordered the lasagna primavera from the lighter side part of the menu (it had spinach and veggies in it).\n\nBreadsticks and salad came out like expected. The breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more. The soup was very good and my husbands lasagna was even better. However, we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna \""light\"" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty, though!\n\nNormally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha. \n\nOverall, ok experience, just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card."
"1","Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good."
"1","i know, I know--Olive Garden, how pedestrian of me! I don't have too many chain restaurant reviews, so I figured I'd write one. We went for a surprise birthday party. My friend had made a reservation which they somehow didn't have (maybe she called the wrong one? Anyway, I'm not going to dock for this). The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice. \n\nWhen we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend \""Do you smell that? It smells like...\"" to which he replied \""wet dog!\"" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. \n\nOnce everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. \n\nDessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent. I'd stay away from this garden like the plague, though."
"1","It is amazing how this restaurant always has long wait times when I honesty don't believe that the food is great. I have gone a couple of times and each time that I have gone I have gotten different dishes. I feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something. You can definitely find better chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's or Bravo! Come here if you like bland dishes."
"1","This place was disgusting!!! I ate here yesterday around 6. I usually love Olive Garden but the last 2times I've been here was nasty. The outside is dirty, front entrance littered with cigarette butts. There is a stinch as soon as you open the door. The food was gross, greasy and very bad. I gave it one star because of the waiter.  I'll never go to this one ever again. The health inspector needs to visit and manager fired!!"
"2","From the time we walked in to the time we left the staff was extremely friendly. The new \""small plates\"" are a great addition to an already great menu selection. Try the crispy asparagus!!! Only 2.99 to add to an entree. My wife had the steak Gorgonzola and it was cooked a perfect medium. All in all I felt like it could not have been a better dinner date night!"
"1","--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! \n\nThis is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. \n\nManagement provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"
"2","MY WAITRESS WAS AMAZING!!! Her name was ALLYSON. I would ask for her if you have the opportunity and she was the waitress on shift. \n\nThis definitely started off as a bad experience. We called at 5:50pm and told them we wanted to come in around 6:30pm and wanted to make a reservation for 6. The hostess on the phone informed me that there was no need to call ahead. We again mentioned that it is a party of 6. She said they are so slow that we don't need it. OKAY!\n\nWe get to the parking lot at 6:30pm and it is packed!!!!! We were a little confused because what we were told earlier. Once we got inside we were told we would have a 40 minute wait. I was pissed because the lady on the phone insisted that we do not need a reservation and here we are stuck waiting. We wanted to talk to the manager, who never came. However after 5 minutes a party of 7 failed to show up and we were given their table. This made sense, we appreciated it.\n\nThereafter, we did the endless pasta for 9 bucks and the soup/salads. Its an olive garden. The food was really good it was nice and warm so thats always a plus. The breadsticks were extremely fresh and flavorful among the best I had. The waitress was attentive but not to much! Our drinks and food were prompt, she came around enough, extremely nice. She made the experience that began negatively a whole lot better. Had we had a horrible waitress the place would have gotten maybe 2 stars.\n\nALLYSON IS AMAZING =] truly a pleasure!"
"1","Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on..."
"2","I've been to this place at least four times now. (once every month) I've had good experiences all four times that I've gone. I do however go during lunch time when they aren't as busy. We also go when we get their buy one entree get one free coupon in the mail. It's an awesome deal! \n\nThey have a huge variety on both their drink and food menu. I will say that I think they have the best steaks compare to Applebee's and Chilli's. Their steaks are super tender and the server always ask you to cut your steak to make sure its cook the way you asked."
"2","Been eating here for three years now, and the service is always good, as is the food. My daughter (5) loves the ribs, as do I.  Our favorite thing to eat here, though, are the Carolina Honey Bites off the appetizer menu.   I've had nothing like them, so they always hit the spot and start the meal off right.  Strongly recommend to fans of ribs."
"1","Currently here at the restaurant. It's noisy, crowded, disorganized, and there are not enough waiters. In our case we got out appetizer and our entree with about a 2-3 minute seperation. They had not even cooled enough to eat them before we got the entree. We were not the only one either, the people next to us had the same thing happen with an even shorter delay. So lets move onto the entree... Two steaks both looked good on the outside. One ordered medium the other medium rare... Both are RARE beyond rare. Giant red center all the way to the edge. This place is to expensive for the level of service that they provide.\n\nSo after this bad experience why did I give a two star review instead of a one.... Because the potato skins were delicious"
"1","So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  \n\nServer was good, but my filet medallion was off . A second filet medallion was undercooked. By this time I was done with my ribs,which were very tasty, and my sides and I asked to see the manager. The manager gave an apology and only charged for the ribs. okay, but won't be going back soon . \n\nMy Strawberry Limeade,an alcoholic beverage, was great!"
"1","I had been a fan of TR for years. Saturday was my first time back and I was dissapointed in the changes. The menu had changed greatly. They took away all the samplers of different ribs and the portions are much smaller. The price has gone up alot also. The ribs taste good but for the price it's just not worth me going back. I heard they were having a tough time thru the county but the changes made I don't believe will make them better."
"1","I received a free entree coupon for my birthday from Tony Roma's, so I used to it to get some takeout since I am alone this week and my husband is gone on a business trip. Otherwise I would have brought him with me and we could have dined in! \nI'd never eaten here before, so I thought it would be great to give their food a test run.\n\nThe girl who brought my food out, (hostess I assume by outfit) walked over with a straight face and asked me if my name was the one on the to go order. It was. She handed me the food and still with a straight, almost unfriendly face asked for the coupon. I handed it to her and gave her a tip also. I always tip, even on free food! I was a server for 2 years at Red Lobster. She didn't smile once and gave off a very unfriendly, almost hostile vibe. Really made me sad. She made me feel like crap for using the coupon that the company sent me!! And I gave her a tip!! Its not like she got nothing out of it!\nI ordered the steakhouse burger (was craving a yummy burger since Im pregnant) and fries. The fries were bad. Not crispy but chewy and not very salty. The burger was pretty yummy, but was slopped in the box carelessly. :/ \nDoesn't seem like good customer service. This was my test run, and I know not to go back and take my husband now."
"2","I came here initially seeking Sriracha, but unfortunately, this location did not carry it. The very handsome sales associate (near the computer stuff on 8/23) with the moist blue eyes and sandy hair was incredibly helpful to my friend and me. He searched other stores for Sriracha and skillfully wrote directions for us. I've never received directions as precise as those he gave us. This sales associate was exceptional and smelled really good. I highly recommend this location for its staff (but don't go here for Sriracha)."
"2","You don't need fancy computer controlled cash registers and racks to get a shirt clean.  \n\nThe husband and wife team that own Starmount Cleaners work six days a week and they have not yet invested in a computerized order taking system.  Maybe that's why they always:\n\n--Remember my name\n--Remember I like medium starch\n--Return my clothes quickly \n--Do so for only $1.50 per shirt\n\nI tried a lot of the bigger cleaners, paid a lot more money and was never satisified until I found this hole in the wall cleaners.  This is one mom and pop you shouldn't miss."
"1","I am all for supporting local small businesses in my communi, butafter having one of my $50 dress shirts sliced in the same two spots on each sleeve by Starmount cleaners i would never return. The owner is very rude, denied damaging my shirt and tried telling me the shirt wore out. Obviously they are dishonest, and are not concerned with long term customer satisfaction. Further, they do their own dry cleaning in-house and do not do as good of a job as the ones who send it out. Avoid this place at all costs. If they damage or loose your items they will leave you out to dry, literally."
"1","I stopped in to get a serpentine belt replaced that I had in hand.  It broke on my lunch hour so I went to AutoZone and bought one.  I how long it would be to get to it and how long it would take.  They said they could get to it \""right now\"" and it shouldn't take long.  30 minutes later they pulled it in the shop.  1 hour later it was completed.  They tried to charge me $212 for 2 hours of labor.  I asked how could it take 2 hours when it was only the shop for 1 hour and I was there for 1.5 hours.  They then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $99.07.  If this is their generic price for 1 hour of labor it is ridiculous.  It shouldn't have take an hour to do it anyway.  This is the first and last time I will visit here.  They also pulled my car in front and left it running while the bill was being discussed.  I am very unhappy with their service and will let everyone I come in contact with.\n\nUpdate.  The owner called me to apologize. He asked me to call back and get a full refund.  He also had a free oil change put on my account.  I called to get the refund.  I probably won't be back.  It's not convienent for me.  I only stopped because I needed ta repair that day and they were close.\n\nThis occured on 9/27/2011."
"1","I wish it were possible to give a business 0 stars because this auto repair facility committed several cardinal sins today and are not trustworthy. \n\n(Background: I am a young female who has had plenty of trouble with being treated unfairly in the auto repair world. It is my pet peeve. It is wrong. And you - mechanics - should feel ashamed for taking advantage of women car owners because you think you can.)\n\nI went to Treadquarters today for help after I noticed a screw had punctured my tire earlier this morning. The tire wasn't deflated yet and the screw was deeply embedded in the tread. I needed a patch so I could go on about my day. When I looked Treadquarters up online they were advertising \""Free Tire Repair\"" with some exclusions, none of which applied to me. This coupon, paired with their good reviews, made it an easy decision to stop by. \n\nThe young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon. I'm assuming this company offers such incentives so that customers will bring them other business that creates better revenue. A smart strategy. However, it doesn't work if your employees are begrudging and dishonest. He went out to my car to look at the damage and proceeded to feed me some bullsh*t about the screw being too close to the side wall. The screw was definitively NOT in the side wall or anywhere near it, no matter how many times he tried to show me with his \""thumb measurement\"". It was only about an inch away from the mid-line of tire. Regardless, this young man said it couldn't be patched and that I needed to buy a new tire. I didn't argue because I knew differently since my dad works on cars and I had already sent him a picture of the situation. I thanked the jerk for his time and drove off. \n\nA few miles down the road, I stopped at Woodies. I told the front desk guy there about my situation and he said they would take a look. My tire was patched and I was back on the road in 30 minutes. I will be doing a separate review for the great service I received at Woodies. \n\nThis type of treatment is inexcusable and I have no qualms with denouncing the entire company until they deal with their dishonest employees. He tried to \""screw\"" me over. Bad move buddy."
"1","I went in Treadquarters Pineville 3 weeks ago to get a patch on my tire. Today I was washing my car I noticed a big scratch on my wheel that went the entire way around. In the past I worked at a custom wheel and tire shop and know that the only thing that will cause this type of damage is if the technician does not pull the wheel weight off the wheel when he dismounts or installs the tire after a repair. Now everybody makes mistakes but back at the tire shop I worked at if the technician made a mistake and caused any kind of damage he would inform the customer. This was not the case at Tread Quarters Pineville. When I went back to Treadquarters to show them the damage, the same young man as mentioned in \""(Aaren H)\"" negative review told me that there is no way that this was the cause of the damage and that I probably curbed my wheel.  Are you freaking kidding me??? It seemed as though he took it personally and then told me that he will file a claim. (In which I still have not heard from the company) I will also make note that he told me that this damage does not affect his hourly pay or anything at the shop.  I have never dealt with such poor management in my life.  This sort of treatment is inexcusable and I have no problem letting everyone I know the the poor treatment I received at Treadquarters in Pineville."
"1","I don't like to give out one stars and I don't give them out lightly without an explanation. I was out driving looking for yard sales in the area when we passed this cute little restaurant. I figured it was probably going to be some amazing southern cooking and my heart was craving some delicious buttered pancakes. To my dismay they were done with breakfast once we arrived. Ah well. No big deal.\n\nWe sat at our table and it took a bit for our server to come and talk to us, and there were only a couple people there. I felt as if our being there was an inconvenience and I was pretty bummed since I'd had such high expectations of the place. We ordered Mt. Dew & when they brought it out, it was in a can. So, obviously, no free refills. Ok. That I was even sort of ok with... \n\nWell when our food came out, I ordered the veggie plate, which was 3 sides. A salad with ranch dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy & corn were my meal & my boyfriend ordered the roast beef special that the server swore by. \n\nMy salad came out and it had only lettuce on the plate with a gallon of ranch dressing. No carrots, cheese, onions or anything but it had a slice of tomato that appeared to have mold on it. Gross. I ate a few bites of the lettuce drenched in ranch before I noticed the tomato & then I pushed it aside. My boyfriend tried the roast beef and said it was so chewy he had to grind it against his teeth for awhile to chew it up & it was just bland in general. \n\nI took a bite of the potatoes because at that point I figure it was the best thing I'd be eating at this place. I stuck them in my mouth and wow... they were flavorless. It was seriously like I'd taken a bite of textured air. Really??? So I said nothing and offered a bite to my boyfriend to see what his reaction was because I knew he wouldn't believe me if I told him. \n\nHe took the bite and stopped chewing immediately and looked at me with a questioning look, and said, \""Gross.\"" The corn was good but that was seriously the only thing I could even eat. He ate a portion of his sandwich and left the rest because he just couldn't do it. I was actually a little angry by this point because I can't believe a place that has been around so long could be this terrible. \n\nWhen we got the bill, it was almost $30!!!!! Yeah and those cans of pop we ordered, $1.50 each! Ridiculous. I will never return to this place and if you're driving by I wouldn't recommend it. Really sad about this one."
"2","Great food. Great down-home atmosphere and friendly staff. Breakfast is wonderful and the coffee is good. Waffle house is crowded yet Corner Cafe is better all the way around."
"2","Had a Breakfasts meeting last week & enjoyed a wonderful breakfast.  I imagine my cholesterol jumped, however it was delicious food.  Steak Omelet, I'm thinking imitation steak but no, also with 3 types of cheeses what could go wrong.  You would think that with that may types of cheeses it would be heavy but no just the right blend & amount cheese & steak.  Home Fries come with it and all I can say is I hope your hungry.  The portion is quite large.  I'm guessing about 1/3 of my plate was home fires.  Overall service was good and food good, price is average for a dinner type atmosphere.  Definitely will add them to my list of restaurants to revisit."
"2","I was a bit skeptical about boarding my dog since I take him wherever I go but I heard rave reviews this place. That being said, I was a tad nervous when taking my dog there last summer. The staff was extremely friendly and understanding about my apprehension about leaving my dog and I thank them for that. When I was away, they emailed me a picture of my dog so I could see he was doing well (plus you can go online and see them on their webcam during play time) They also offer additional packages with more play time, ice cream doggie treats, bed time stories (don't laugh, thats just cute) and more. My dog was so happy when I went to pick up, I think he was even smiling! I think their prices are pretty reasonable for overnight stay compared to some other joints in the area and have taken him there a few times since.  \n\n Best Friends also offers your pets first night free which is pretty sweet seeing that I have nothing against saving $$$$ here and there and they provide you with a report card when you pick them up--again--cute!! Even though I dont like near there anymore, I would definitely go there again and can't recommend them enough."
"1","I recently went out of town for 4 days and decided to try Best Friends Pet Care.  The staff was pretty friendly and the whole boarding process was pretty simple and fast.  My major gripe is when I picked up my two dogs four days later, they both smelled really badly, one of them had feces caked to her entire underside with a cut on her back right leg, and as soon as I took them outside they acted as if they hadn't been out to go all day as they immediately went right off the sidewalk (both of them peed and pooped!  - this never happens, usually I have to walk them forever to get them to go).  I did like the fact that they sent me a picture of them during my trip and that they gave me a report card - although the card said both of their bowel movements were normal - but when they went as soon as I took them from the facility, it was both diarrhea.  Overall, the place is nice, folks are friendly...I was just not pleased with the condition of my dogs when I picked them up."
"2","LOVE THIS PLACE!  Best Friends treats my baby like no other.  She goes there, and they treat her like she is one of their own.\nNow, having said this, we haven't taken advantage of the boarding or doggie day-care services.  Sammie gets groomed about every other month and she loves it!  The rates are reasonable ($60 - She's a mid-sized Black Lab/Border Collie Mix), and they think of everything.  They know that I work all day, so they let me drop her off first thing in the morning and pick her up on my way home from work.  After she is finished with her grooming, she plays with the other dogs that are there for Doggie Day-Care.\nSammie smells so good when I pick her up and she always has a cute bandana on her.  To add that personal touch, whenever I make an appointment, they ask me if I'd like the same groomer as last time.  Heather is Sammie's \""Best Friend\"".  I know that she will take good care of Sammie whenever I drop her off.  In the end, that's what is most important to me.  I know that Sammie has a great day whenever she goes to Best Friends."
"2","These guys are great!!!\nMy boyfriend took his dog here the other day and they took him without an appointment with no hassles! They did a great job and we got our baby back in a reasonable time! \nWe will be back."
"1","This place had availability as we were calling everyone, when we got there it has a strong odor, I asked to see where they were keeping her and they said ohh we will get someone to show u. Once the person came and got us and showed us where she was going to be I almost cried with the loudness of the dogs barking giving me a headache as she was shaking I almost wanted to say forget it but we were in a hurry. I felt as go my dog went to doggy hell. The staff was more mindset on other things then telling us about what she would be doing and if they took them out for potty breaks, I'm guessing they just go in their cage, how gross, so that was disappointing. We dropped her off at 4pm on sat and were told we can only pick her up Sunday between 3-6pm and that the first night free but we got charged for two nights?? Wtf? So we ended up paying $37.00 I never received any pic of her and when I asked about it they pretty much ignored me. I liked Ironton boarding as they seem more in tune with saying hi to your furry friend and facility was calm and collective, and only $22 a night and have the friendliest staff that are always happy to see you. Dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside. I will NEVER take my dogs to Best friend pet care ever again!!!"
"1","I took my dog here to be boarded.  He came home unhappy, but I didn't think much of it (maybe he just missed us).   I used them a second time to groom my dog.  This is where the problem arose.  When I went to pick up my dog, they gave me someone elses pet.  Even though this was a chocolate lab (like mine), it was obviously not my dog.  Then they argued with me saying he was he only chocolate lab they had.  Well....one hour later and 3 other labs (I thought mine was the only one!)...they finally found my dog.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you hate your dog and want to trade him in for another model."
"1","DANGER: This place is way too small to take in the number of dogs that it takes. The online viewing is deceiving and makes this place look larger than what it is. They will try to take your dog and quickly escort him/her into the play room. However, be sure to ask for a tour and see the space. I took the tour and the space is SMALL. I was there one day and they had 17 dogs in a space the size of my living room. That is dangerous! If something were to happen (ie. a fight) all of the dogs would join (pack behavior) and there would be nothing they could do to protect your pup."
"1","I boarded my dogs here and spent thousands of dollars with this place because of our travel schedule. I  lost a lot of money with my business and couldn't afford to get my dogs. When we called they said no payment, no dogs. Ok, I understand but then they tried to say we had abandoned the dog's. They would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan. They shipped all 3 of my dogs off and won't say where they are. I understand they wanted their money. They sent us to collections and gave my dogs away and said it was in the contract that we signed that they can do that. They said they have no idea where the dogs are now.  When I say we spent a lot of money with them, it was thousands over time when you are paying for multiple dogs. My issue is if you are going to ship my dogs off you could have given them to me and work something out and they never told me they were shipping the dogs off. They told us after they shipped them off! I had to give one star rating but only because u have to."
"2","Anything shiny grabs my attention immediately. I easily get distracted in Jared's. I went in to repair a bracelet I purchased over a year ago and I found myself lusting over case after case of jewelry.\n\nJared's offers great customer service. I purchased a couple items from one of their stores in Arizona and the location here was more than willing to help repair without charge. In both locations I've encountered very nice sales staff.\n\nYou cannot go wrong with buying me something at this store!"
"1","Buyer beware. I had purchased my fianc\u00e9's engagement and wedding band from Jared and was pleased with everything. So my fianc\u00e9 went to purchase me a watch for a wedding gift. The man sized the band for me and we left the store. The watch sat in the box for about 2 weeks until I tried it on again. I decided the watch wasn't for me and wanted to return it with in 30 days. My fianc\u00e9 was running errands and tried to return it to the Concord store where they were rude and told he to come back to this store. Once she arrived the general manager was extremely rude and calling her a liar saying the watch was worn and he got a phone call from the Concord store \""warning him\"" about my fianc\u00e9. We had to take our issue up with corporate and posting on their Facebook page we were finally able to return the watch. Beware once they get your money they will burn you on warranties and returns. Just go look at their Facebook page. It's nearly all complaints on it when other jewelry stores Facebook pages have not even half as many complaints. Stay away from this place."
"1","Quickly losing stars. Nickle and dime you. Not a fan.\n\nHubs went shopping for some sparkle and shine for me. He did very well! He mentioned that once he picked out the earrings he was told that there is an extra charge for the earring posts. What?! How do the posts not come with the earrings (especially when you throw down a lot of Benjamins to begin with)? That is just crazy. \n\nNext, the necklace he gave me as a gift was a tad too long. So I went in and had the receipt and asked to exchange the chain for a shorter one. The employee then proceeded to tell me that I would have to drop it off, they would have it the following day, and there would be a charge to shorten it. What?! \n\nPaying for a gift given to you is nuts. That's most of a jeweler's business...sweethearts buying for their sweetheart as a surprise and they won't always get the size right.\n\nIn any case, thankfully the two employees that my husband worked with when he was in and the other that helped me when I was there worked with us to comp the earring posts and got my chain corrected that same moment at no charge. The employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a 1 star.\n\nNeedless to say, after these recent experiences I'm even more inclined to take my business to the local mom & pops jewelers. I don't appreciate the extra fees and hassle that seems to be part of the process with this company. Jared's has gotten too big and too corporate and lost its focus on building relationships and loyalty with customers. I don't remember Jared's being like this in the past, but I heard they purchased Zales and a lot has changed. \n\nToo bad, Jared's. Your jewelry is gorgeous and employees are kind, but the shopping experience you create for the buyer has lost its charm and is now tainted in my book."
"2","Love these guy's.  I have been taking my car there since 2008.  First time I brought my car there was for an oil change.  Told Rod at the desk I needed cv joints because another mechanic said I did.  Well, I didn't, He however told me what I needed and took me in the shop and showed me every aspect of my car and his suggestions.  I was the first feel good experience I have had at a repair shop.  Rod has since gone and Tim has taken his place and he gives me the same customer service I have grown to love.  Keep it up guys!"
"1","This is a review of their business practices online.  \n\nEssentially, a long time ago I started getting emails from this exact precision tune.  Someone there must have given my email as theirs, or the tech mis-typed it.  \n\nDO NOT LET THEM HAVE YOUR EMAIL.. there is no way to get off the list.  I'm now taking actions to report their mis-handling in the case they send any more emails..\n\nIf you get stuck with their emails, contact their admin by searching 'whois ptautocare.com' and getting their email.  \n\nEdit : They claim the link at the bottom will unsubscribe.  I clicked that thing many a time man... been getting emails for years from you, the Honda Dealership nearby, etc etc... FML"
"1","Will never go back. Was there 2 hours before closing for an oil change and was turned away because they did not have enough time.  I gladly took my business elsewhere."
"2","When I bought my vehicle two years ago, I decided to go to Precision for my car's routine oil change/tire rotations.  Not exactly sure why, maybe the coupons that come in, or that it is close to us, but I've had no problems dealing with them.\n\nMy only complaint, is they are always busy!  So people must like them, as I always have to wait.  This weekend I went late Saturday afternoon and had about a 1.5 hour wait for my oil change and tire rotation.  I have left work early to have this done as well, and it is still a long wait.  I think that is just part of the business no matter where you go though.  At least their waiting area is nice and comfortable with a clean bathroom!  I've had no problems walking around the adjacent shopping center while I wait as well.\n\nI am also with Brian H. on the female manager.  She was there last year when I came in and I was not a fan of her, she wanted me to do more to my car than what was needed - I said no to all of that.  All the other times, including this time, I was told my car looked great.  I trust them there with my car, but definitely not her.\n\nOne more quick thing, make sure you get your key back for your tires if you have a rotation.  This last time they kept it and I turned right back around to get it.  Previously, I did not even notice they had kept it until I returned months later and it was not in my car, luckily they still had it.  I know they do not mean to do it on purpose, but they get so busy they forget something that could be so important if I get a flat tire. \n\nSo far so good with my car!"
"1","Slow, absolutely the worst.  Horrible communication skills and customer service. I wouldn't imagine In million years how inconsiderate people in the auto business could be."
"1","There's a reason no one goes here. Service is horrible. Even with only 1 other person in the store the staff acts like their overwhelmed. How this location is still in business is some type of weird paradox. Don't bother to stop. You have been warned."
"2","Visit this location several times before.\nFood was fresh, prepared quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.\nDinning room...all the tables were dirty.\nFood better than the normal burger chain so understand the slightly higher price.\nWill come back"
"1","Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers, because this was horrible.  When we walked in, it was like we were in the South Pacific.  Seriously.  The thermostat must have been set at 90.  A nice change from the 40 degree weather outside, but after about three minutes, it was the worst.  Maybe that's for atmosphere, but it was not enjoyable.\n\nTo make the experience even less appetizing, the place is cramped and the staff does not help at all in this regard - they are constantly in the middle of the aisles, writing tickets and getting drinks in the middle of the walking areas and the like.  Again, they could be going for atmosphere, and having the staff constantly around is nice, but with overbearing heat and little room to move it's not good.  It's bad.  Really bad.  If you don't like personal space, you're good.  Really good even.  Otherwise, it stinks.  Literally.  I've been to restaurants in big cities, where rent is outrageous, that have more room to move than this.  In Pineville, there ought to be all sorts of elbow room (Schoolhouse Rock anyone?).\n\nYes, there is a sushi bar where a guy makes it in front of you.  Let me first tell you that I'm not really a sushi guy.  I like California rolls and those little rice cakes with shrimp on them, and a few other things, but none of the more exotic stuff.  But this was nasty.  He would take a big fried thing and plop it down on a plate and squirt some heavy mayo-like sauce all over it.\n\nThat's not too bad, right?  Well, once the rolls were gone, he'd do it again - without cleaning the plate.  That's right, there was a buildup of this mayo on the platter.  Several varieties, all right there under the lights.  It was pretty sickening.  Like a sushi hog pond.\n\nOn the regular buffet, it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't that good either.  If you want a Southern food buffet (meat, rolls, corn), it's okay.  But the Chinese food was just average.  Add that to the place, the staff, the price - go elsewhere.  China King and Dragon House aren't far away, and Tin Tin is just up the street (though I'm not a huge fan of Tin Tin either).  You'll have a much nicer experience."
"1","Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  \n\nThe buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp, Mei Fun, and maybe the sweet and sour chicken.  Skip everything else!!!!\n\nDon't even think about eating the sushi.  I was feeling adventurous so I grabbed a few of the sushi rolls that I easily recognized (california, cucumber).  One of them tried to crawl off the plate before I got back to my seat!  The rolls were chewy and just plain gross, makes my stomach turn to think about it.\n\nService was polite and good on the refills.\n\nEnter at your own risk!"
"2","Absolute best price for quality sushi, and well worth the quick drive from Rock Hill. Tony is a fantastic sushi chef, and an extremely nice guy, to boot. He is definitely the reason my wife and I come back so often, but the variety and quality of the buffet is great, too."
"1","Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold, when they should be hot. Disappoined overall. Not clean, either. 11.99 per person not worth it."
"1","This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights, you can see splatter of food from the last decade. While I was eating, a waitress emptied plates into some bus boy buckets and some fell on the floor and she kicked it under the cart! Tons of garbage and food under these carts. Blech!! Then all the food was cold and hard. Bathroom was a hellhole. No idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way."
"1","Avoid this place.  Food was decent, but a lot of it was cold and did not taste fresh.  I tried the crab legs on the buffet, and as soon as I cracked them an ammonia smell was present.  \nThey had a lot of American dishes on the buffet as well, over salted and overall not that good.  \nThe other food was decent, but as I said before was cold.  \nHowever, the sushi was decent, not the quality you expect at an actual sushi restaurant.  But the guy making made me a custom roll and was very nice about it.  \n\nHowever, if you do come, just get the sushi, it's worth the price and just avoid the buffet."
"1","Did not like it. Luke warm food that was not appetizing or tasteful. Not the cleanest establishment."
"1","I am usually reluctant to complain, but....\nToday I paid $29.99 for \""managers special\"" which included the works.  Poor job.  Carpets poorly vacuumed, exterior of car still had dirt on it, leather seats not cleaned properly, and the console was filled with water.   Armor-all protectant all over the place and not wiped down properly.  Air freshener that smells like urinal cake.  Pleasant staff, but poor quality work."
"1","Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell."
"1","I've taken my car here at least twice. Both times it failed on a defective license bulb.\nNot the biggest problem in the world of maintenance but they charged me $8 to screw it in.\n\nIf you get your car tested here, I would recommend checking your bulbs first and if they say they need to be replaced, buy the bulb from them but screw it in yourself."
"1","My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question."
"1","I used to only take both my vehicles here when it was buffalo Tire, the service was friendly and the work was good... \n\nOverall the attitude you get from these guys at tire kingdom is that you are bothering them if you have a question, and you should just pay them whatever they say with no explanation, they make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome and are just plain rude.  \n\nSince they've Changed to Tire Kingdom the place has gone WAY down hill.  The last time I went there was for an oil change... \nThe first day (Friday) I showed up around 12 O'clock there were 2 techs standing outside and two cars parked there... I asked the techs if they could do an oil change and he said no come back tomorrow around 9am\nShowed up the second day (Saturday) and the place was packed... after waiting for an hour to get my car in, one of the guys came back and asked where I had my last oil change because they had completely stripped the bolt on the oil pan.  I told them it was done there and showed them the paper work.  Because it was a weekend they could not get the part and asked if I could come back Monday.  I said no problem and asked if I needed an appointment they said no we will get you in just come after 10 because they needed to get the part from the dealer ...\nShowed up Monday around 11 and they had not gotten the part, once I got there they sent someone to get it.... 4 hours or so later (had time to walk to the mall, eat, walk around and get back before my car was pulled in) my oil change was done, then the tech proceeded to tell me that my rear brakes needed to be done and quoted me $780 for that... I didn't get the brakes done there, but I did have to pay full price for my 3 day oil change... $80 and not even one apology for the trouble. (I'm not the type of person to get bent out of shape about stuff I understand these things happen... bottom line is if they had apologized and maybe gave me a discount, especially for a repeat customer then I am sure I would still be getting my cars serviced there).\n\nI took my car to a shop around the corner and they did my brakes for about half the price I was quoted.   \n\nI will never go back here after taking my vehicles here for years, I feel sorry for Tommy he knows what customer service is.  It's a-shame his management and co-workers have no clue.\n\nIf you have a foreign car I would recommend Independence auto around the corner on south blvd they act like they actually appreciate your business and they do a good job"
"1","If I could give 0 stars for this business I would!  Was totally ripped off!!!\nTook my car in to have NC Inspection.  While waiting, I could hear yelling coming from the service area.  After waiting 35-40 minutes the manager,  Will, came out and told me my car did not pass inspection and I needed new tires for it to pass. ( I had already been told by another employee they were fine).  I told Will that and he said \n\""well they won't pass for NC\"". I left without buying tires.  Went around the corner to another place of business and had my car inspected and it passed! No problems with the tires. Later  in the afternoon I received a car from the gentleman that does the state inspections for this Tire Kingdom.  He apologized to me and told me my car was really okay to pass inspection including the tires but his boss, Will, had told him to fail me so I would buy tires.  Inspector refused to fail me since it really was ok and that is what all the yelling I heard from the service area was about. He told me he could not go on knowing that I had been  cheated. He said he had to do what his boss said even though he is the one that is certified to do the inspections- NOT WILL.  Kudos for an honest person there even though the manager is a crook.  I made a complaint to Corporate and have had several conversations with someone \nfrom Corp.  They admitted Will was wrong and should not have done that!   \n\nHOWEVER, Will is still the manager there so BEWARE!  \n\nI was taken advantage of by  this business just so Will could sell some tires.  What does it say about the company that keeps someone like this on as an employee and especially as a manager!!???   \nANOTHER BEWARE- I went on Better Business Bureau  site to file a complaint.  You may want to read about this company on the BBB site before you think about doing business with them."
"2","My car broke down the other night and a friend told me I should have it towed to Buffalo Tire.  Being in a jam, I had it towed there only to later find out that it had changed ownership and become Tire Kingdom.  I read the reviews online and my heart sank as most of them seemed to be negative... not a good feeling when you seem \""forced\"" to use their services.   \n\nMy experience has been all positive.  Robert has been professional and thorough, keeping me informed throughout the whole process.  I explained my hesitancy to do business there because of the poor reviews and he was very sympathetic and explained the situation.  Apparently, the store has had 11 different managers in a 2 year period and he was hired specifically to turn things around.   So far, he's doing a great job.  I would definitely give this store an opportunity for your business.   \n\nI don't work here, am not related to anyone here and have nothing to gain by posting this.  I just want to see people trying hard to do right and be honest get the support and business they need."
"1","My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. \n\nOnce we did get seated, service was slow and really bad. I had to ask 4 times for silverware, 3 times for a straw for my sons cup, and the food just wasn't that good. My plate was dirty. My son asked for strawberries on his pancakes and they had blueberry syrup on them - I wonder who's plate they scraped them off of. \n\nOh and the straw came as we were paying. Not our best IHOP experience."
"1","My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.\n\nYou might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences, well it is very cheap & its closer to the house than driving down to Carrowinds to go to Cracker Barrel."
"2","Josh is awesome!! Great server. Get the ayce pancakes. Yum!"
"1","The service was very friendly, but the food wasn't all that good. Most everything tasted like it had been sitting around for quite a while before being plated. Especially the potatoes. Not sure I would return."
"1","My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes, pumpkin pancakes & grits. It will probably be good. Their grill guy is pretty consistent in turning out good food. There are quite a few people here for a Saturday night. Well the food was barely warm. Not an auspicious start to the meal. Cold grits aren't a treat. All in all I wondered why we bothered going.\n\nWe went to iHop for brunch today 11/5/12 around noon & had Katrina as our server. It wasn't the best meal as far as service was concerned. I had to call her back to the table to refill my drink. Apparently my empty glass wasn't enough of a visual cue. The meal itself was average, a bacon cheeseburger with fries and sweet tea. I don't think of iHop as a lunchtime destination and I probably never will."
"1","I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions."
"1","Okay, I know this is just an IHOP, so I shouldn't expect culinary excellence.  \n\nBut.\n\nWe've been to this location a couple times.  They do breakfast VERY well.  Their coffee is always fresh and hot.  Their pancakes are always fresh and hot.  Their orange juice is never too tart, never too sweet.  I've never found foreign items in my food.  Wait staff is always courteous and helpful.\n\nBut.\n\nBeware - when you order NON-breakfast items, you may not end up with a satisfying meal.  This past weekend I took my daughter and my grandmother to the IHOP for a quick & cheap post-church lunch.  My grandmother ordered coffee and a belgian waffle - she said it was very delicious.  My daughter got the baby cakes kids meal, and she ate most of it.  I made the mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and corn on the side.  The chicken fried steak was so tough as to be inedible (I took a couple bites and left the rest).  The mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning.  I took one bite and when I realized I was eating aged potatoes, I left the rest.  The corn was the best thing on the plate.  Needless to say when we got home I made myself a sandwich since I didn't really get lunch at the IHOP. *lol*\n\nAs I said, we've been to this location before, and they definitely do breakfast right (which makes sense given what an IHOP is).  My daughter and grandmother were very satisfied with their meals.  But stick with the breakfast menu.  Don't venture anywhere near the non-breakfast menu.  Then you should be fine."
"1","New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.\n\nThe other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot, only warm. I think the grills are just for show. I think that they warm everything in an Easy Bake oven under a 10watt bulb."
"2","Cedric is our server. A nice polite young man. I ordered a breakfast sampler. The restaurant is absolutely packed this morning. The food was hot & delivered promptly. Cedric was a great server I'd be happy to have him serve us again."
"2","(6/16/13) Its time to use my free birthday coupon. Argh, the menus have changed again. According to Spring the prices have gone up an average of 0.20 across the board. The new menus also are missing the side items for non breakfast foods. The pictures for each dish are closer to the ways that the dishes actually look rather than some corporate artist's fantasy.\n\nI had an omelet with red velvet pancakes & sweet tea. It was good, comfort food that hit the spot better than Red Robin did."
"1","Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes."
"2","Absolutely authentic Japanese grocery store in the town. Japanese food only!  This is not a big store, but I can find almost 90% things I need to cook.  I love their frozen fishes, variety choice at a reasonable price.  I love their frozen tofu stuffs and frozen fish balls. I put these for my homemade hot pot.  They also have some vegetables and snacks. They are at Westinghouse in Pineville, I just drive 5 more minutes after I take exit 65B."
"2","I always go here for oil changes they are quick and cheap not to mention its the closest jiffy lube to my house. they also send great coupons via mail/email! and its not usually crowded. i love it."
"1","I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that, and kept trying to sell me crap.  Over-priced, slow, very dirty, and an overall sketchy vibe."
"1","\""Experienced better\"" per the two stars? Not really. They're all the same. This was my second time here. Second time after my other engine oil changer shop annoyed me for the last time, but that's another review. First time here was OK-good. This time? Wasn't impressed. Irritated actually. Why do all these automobile engine oil changeries want to sell me on the power steering fluid flush? Or the fuel system cleaner? Or the fuel system additive (\""improves fuel economy by 20%\"" whoaaaa)? Or a new air filter. The only thing they didn't want to do was flush my brake fluid. Guess it was OK? They drained the engine oil then brought me in and proceeded to walk me through 200 services they could perform. Everything for $460. All of this after I said the engine oil change was all that was necessary. The guy really didn't care and continued to read off the \""sales\"" screen. At one point I just about got into an argument with him when he started talking about change intervals. I \""learned\"" that the recommended change interval was 3000 miles (\""we don't go by months any more\"" noted!) if you drive in X conditions (stop & go traffic, cold starts, drag racing, etc.). Otherwise it was 7500 miles. Perfect. He then asked if I wanted to go with 3000 miles, 7500 miles or my own decision. Huh? I'm going to get my vehicle's oil changed whenever the hell I want, aren't I? I didn't understand why he was asking that or the reason. He couldn't explain why he was asking the question either. We went round and round for a few seconds then I just said 5000 miles and he entered it in the computer. After that he walked through the remaining 100 services they offered and then showed me my air filter. Apparently, with the amount of dust that is in there, my air filter is reducing my gas mileage by 1-2%. Who knew? All I know is a dirty filter is more affective at trapping particles than a clean filter. I passed on the filter change and all the services, paid the $46 and was on my way. He was kind enough to introduce me to his manager and walk me to my car. That was a little awkward though. And, I saw them do it to everyone before me, so I wasn't special. After I got in my vehicle I noticed the next change interval was 3000 miles from now...why did I tell him 5000 miles again?\n\nWhere am I going with this? I know what I want and I need. If I claim I know and I don't, then it is on me. If I tell you I only want an engine oil change then that is all I want. Simple as that.\n\nNot sure if I'll go back here. But then again, if I go to another place it'll be the same thing."
"1","First time customer 5/10/213.\n\n They are not very through. Went in for an inspection and failed due a broken passenger mirror and weak wipers. I repaired the mirror at another location and they noticed my belts were split and cracking very badly. If it was not for the mirrors, they would have passed me and my car would have been in bad shape later down the road. I'm glad I did not get my oil changed there who knows what would have happened"
"1","I bought a number of items there. among them there was\n- 1 item off the floor it wasn't delivered on schedule no biggie\n- 1 entry door with transom ($500)\n- 1 custom window $1,200.\n\nThe style of the door and the transom didn't match, I called and was told \""that's what you ordered\"" . Really I asked for mismatched styles? I ordered for the lightest clearest low-e glass available, I got the dark type of glass that's recommended for Fla, Nm, Az etc. \"" That's what you ordered\"" was the response again. \n\nThey don't even bother to ask what was shipped or what you ordered, they don't want to know because CYA is the order of the day.\nThen when you go over your buyer's order you realize that regardless of the conversation you had with their salesperson the printed order is so vague that they could ship you anything at all and claim that's what you ordered. My contractor bought my siding there, it's an off-brand and the quality doesn't impress. \nReally shoddy practices\n\nI ordered the rest of the windows ( Andersen) from The Plywood Mart although they won't match these and they were more expensive, that shows how I feel about sponsoring this store again"
"1","Our country club recently hired the building company to install a rather large deck. After it was installed, several boards warped on the railing causing the dowels to fall out (dangerous) and the facia board all the way around warped. After MANY calls and emails they finally had someone show up only to say \""warping isn't covered\"". It arped after one month! They said they would fix it for additional money - $1200. I can promise you these people will NOT stand behind their work and if you can find another retailer/contractor, I highly recommend doing so. Do not do business with these people."
"1","I agree with the 1 star here. It seems every time I'm in here I catch these guys when they have had a bad day. I'm in alot of businesses during the day and this has to be my least favorite one to go to. Not because of the product but the customer experience!"
"1","The Pineville Ice House is kinda crappy. There is no lobby. You walk in and you're in the ice rink, so there isn't a warm place to hang out or put on your skates. The ice is not great quality, and I've been pretty disappointed overall with my experiences there. If you're looking for a rink in Charlotte, check out the Extreme Ice Center."
"1","The Pineville Icehouse is geared for hockey only.  The public skate times are too short and too expensive.  I tried renting skates, 3 pairs and no luck.  The first pair had laces that were cobbled together from 2 different skates.  The blades were dull and rounded over like an old butter knife.  The second pair was better, but the left blade was bent to the right at a 10 degree angle making it impossible to skate.  The last pair was a bit better, but wholly unusable.  This wasn't just my experience, this was the experience of all 7 of us in the group.  All the skates had been abused and hadn't seen a sharpener or any maintenance in quite some time.  \n\nWe decided to stick with Extreme Ice in Indian Trail.  It is a bit of a drive, but a professional operation start to finish.  New skates, longer skate times and a pro shop that caters to other skaters, not just hockey."
"2","With a good low rate of $7.50 for entry and $2.50 for skate rental this is arguably the best option for a first-time ice skater in the Charlotte area. The Pineville Ice House, as it is better known, is great fun with the kids, a group, family, for a birthday party and most other stuff you think of doing at your standard roller-rink except the kicker is that it's on ice!\n\nI've made it here a number of times including once with a big group for a [dangerous] game called broom ball. In broom ball, the players clad only in their everyday clothes and without ice skates, go out on the ice with a broom-like stick to swat at a ball until makes it into the other team's goal. All the while you spend most of your time trying not to throw yourself off balance with a misplaced swing and land yourself in the hospital with a concussion. But hey! This review isn't meant to trash ice skating. Only the futile and foolish game of broom ball.\n\nNonetheless, PIH is a good starting point for you up-and-coming figure skaters out there. The main advice I have is to just check their website as they have some oddly specific hours during which they are open to the public for skating. Watch out for the kids and remember to dress warm and always fall with closed hands or you'll take home less fingers than you brought."
"1","The Winter Olympics inspired us to hit the ice rink. I'm no Michelle Kwan but I've been on the ice a time or two. This rink just didn't blow my mind. \n\nWe arrived right when the open skate time started (check their website for the schedule). The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. \n\nThe negatives... I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette... There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! \n\nThe positives... They serve beer and wine!! If it wasn't so early in the day, I would have partaken. The employees that I interacted with seemed friendly enough. \n\nPineville Ice House doesn't have a lot of competition, which means they really don't need to change much to stay in business. If you live in Charlotte and you want to go ice skating this will probably be where you head."
"1","I have lived all over the US and even globally and I can honestly say that in my opinion FairPoint is the WORST telephone company I have ever dealt with. I moved in 11/2009 and they are still holding my credit balance refund hostage. When I called to request information, the company says I need to have a court order or be an attorney to have access to my own account information!? When I pointed out that the latter applies, I was transferred to another department. Even the managers are rude, unkind and argumentative. They don't dispute that they owe me money just that they should actually pay it to me in any kind of a reasonable timeframe. When I had their actual phone and internet service, it was highly unreliable, too and the technicians were almost as \""nice\"" as the customer service people. If you live in an area where you have a choice, exercise that choice and go with a different company!"
"1","If there were a \""zero stars\"" rating, Fairmont would have MORE THAN earned it.\nThis company leveraged itself to the eyebrows to purchase the right to use Verizon's obsolete landline infrastructure; the hedge funds that now own it have steadfastly refused to upgrade that infrastructure, with resulting extended outages for business and residential customer throughout the region.\nWe've had our business DSL line for three years. In that time we haven't had 30 consecutive days of uninterrupted service. Their \""routing issues\"" have been daily, and their customer support structure is dysfunctional: the only thing they seem to have mastered is the \""I'm terribly sorry for you inconvenience\"" portion of their telephone script. \nSince their latest foray into union-busting here it has only become worse. We in Vermont very much hope that our public service regulators will go after this mountain of corporate grift will all guns blazing: we've had enough of southern corporate carpetbaggers making promises they are systemically incapable of delivering on."
"1","My 97 year old mother who is blind moved from one room to another and the company said it would take a week to change the phone because it was a holiday.  After the week was up they said the work order was extended a month because they had so much new business.   I escalated the issue.   The said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  No response.  Some company!"
"1","I was new in town and needed an eyebrow wax. I found the Spa at Ballantyne and decided to give it a try. Although I received a skewer of yummy pinneaple while I was waiting for my technician that was the highlight of my expereince. We got in the room and after what seemed like just two strips pulled off she said I was done. She didn't have a mirror in the room so she said I could use a metal bowl to try and see my reflection or we could go into the bathroom and she could tweeze and strays in there. Are you kidding?\nThis wouldnt have been so bad if it was super cheap, but the waxing was $20 and then they add automatic tip on there so it came to $24. There are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money."
"1","I was so surprised as to the level of disappointment I experienced at this spa. My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.\nHere are my main issues:\n1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water?) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot? We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke.\n2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital.\n3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck?  My friend's massage included an actual massage.\n4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.\n5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.  I haven't felt THIS ripped off in a very long time.\nIf you are used to a special experience and you feel you deserve to be pampered and be made to feel good, Do Not Go Here unless you don't care where your money goes."
"1","UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.\n\nSo, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director."
"1","UPDATE #2 - spoke with the new spa manager and she promises a great experience for my friend and me. I will update."
"1","Update # 3...OK we went for our 'great experience'. It was ok. Massages themselves were good-to-great. Nothing else was improved. No follow-up from the manager considering the situation. I promise you that you can find something better to do with $175."
"1","I fianc\u00e9 gave me a gift card here for my birthday. I was so excited because I work for a salon and spa so I was wanting to get pampered. I received a body wrap, a massage, a shampoo blow dry and a manicure. The only thing I enjoyed was Brenda who did my body wrap she was awesome! My massage was with tym. He didn't listen to anything I said. I told him I am on my feet all day and I have back problems so I would like him to focus on my back and to please not rub my feet. He did the total opposite. He maybe rubbed my back for 5 minutes ad did my legs and feet for the rest and the time. Then told me one of my legs were shorter than the other and I should get it checked out. I'm sorry but that was so rude he could have tried to say it nicely. The lady who did my blowout was very sweet but my hair was still wet at the roots when I left and the ends of my hair was fizzy. For $40 I expected so expected something a lot better. Lastly I got a manicure I didn't need more than a buff and polish because I get a manicure once a week anyways. But I saw if I got an upgrade from that I could get a massage in that so I did. If I would have known that \""massage\"" would have just been putting lotion on my hands I would have not paid the extra. The ladies at the mall do a better job. Needless to say I am extremely displeased with my services here. (Besides Brenda) Maybe because I am a service provider myself so my exceptions are high. But next time I pay $420 somewhere I'll make sure it's not here."
"2","Yes, this spa is probably pricey compared to other places, but it's in a nice hotel with a certain type of clientele I'm sure.  But I guess maybe because I'm from LA and going to Glen Ivy and Burke Williams has spoiled me for the cheaper places?  I expect not only the service but amenities as well.   I want it to be a day of pampering.\n\nI took my bestie out for a spa day since she really needed one.  I booked my massages and pedicures over the phone from LA.  The lady that helped me on the phone gave me a few helpful tips.  They have a \""couples massage package\"" that has a scrub and a massage, but she told me how that one worked, and being that yes you get to be in the same room with your friend, mom, daughter, partner but one does the massage while the other has the scrub and then you switch.  Yes it's a cheaper package, but if we get our own massages, they can set it up to be at the same time and adjoining rooms.  Okay - thanks for the heads up!\n\nI also had to move the day last minute due to some scheduling problems with my bestie, but we were able to easily reschedule luckily.\n\nWe arrived for our massages probably about 10-15 mins early.  We were hoping for a little more time, but after going to lunch it just got a bit closer than planned.\n\nWe were greeted at the front desk and we were told to head downstairs and an attendant will help us once we got there.  Once we were downstairs, the guy down there called up a female attendant so that she could show us around the women's spa area and gave us our slippers.\n\nI have to say, for someone who's been to quite a few nice spas, this was more or less par for the course.  Extremely clean.  Plenty of towels available.  I did wish there was a hot tub in the area like in most spas, but there was multiple dressing areas with lockers (that had robes waiting for us), showers, a sauna and a steam room, plus the waiting area that had an assortment of teas, coffee, water with cucumber or fruit or plain water plus a nuts/dried fruit mix and a mix of chips for us to eat.  I think there were also apples.\n\nWe waited for our massages (which were 80 mins aromatherapy massages that were at a discount because they were the special promotional ones for the Thanksgiving holiday) and our massage therapists came to get us.  Come to find out now only were the rooms next to each other, it kinda was like having a \""couples\"" massage anyways because the adjoining rooms actually had a door with sliding doors so it because one big room anyways.  \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our massages and when we were leaving, our massage therapists were there for us with water and three roses a piece.  It was very special.\n\nBack to the waiting area for our pedicures.  We stopped by the sauna on the way to relax a bit since we had about 30 mins before we needed to be \""picked\"" up by our pedicure ladies.\n\nOur pedicures were nice.  Since it was also put as a \""couples\"" pedi, we were sitting next to each other with a nice view of the pool area and the golf course.  The ladies doing our pedicures were super nice and friendly. \n\nWe had a great time over all.  Yeah, we could have paid less to a day spa elsewhere and a pedicure elsewhere, but we were there to have a spa experience, and we were able to have our nice girls day out."
"2","Every year on Black Friday, my mom, sister, 2 aunts and I come over for facials.  It's our way of avoiding the malls and such and to have a girls day of sorts.  It's attached to a hotel and is pretty fancy and on the pricey side, but I'm guessing they have a certain type of guest they go after.  Full service spa with facials, spa treatments, massages, wraps, etc.  The staff is always friendly and very pleasant to deal with.  We're led downstairs to pick up lockers and sandals and head into the locker rooms to get changed.  \n\nWe're always called back on time (sometimes early if we're there early) and the girls who do our facials are absolutely wonderful.  They work well and always cater to the skin type of who they're working on.  My only complaint is at the end of the facial, they always do this tapping thing with their fingers all over your face and that annoys me for some reason.  I'm really not a fan of it for some reason!!  Anyways, they always fill out a card with the products that they used if you're interested in purchasing them for yourself and offer you water when you leave.  Keep in mind, it's pricey over here so it's a splurge when you go, but worth it!"
"2","I'm only commenting on the salon because that is all I went to during my stay at the hotel.  I was lucky to get a last minute reservation to get a manicure since it was Mother's Day weekend and they were apparently booked the entire time.\n\nI got an essential manicure with Marilyn and she was awesome.  She was friendly without being overly so, and we had a nice conversation while she dealt with my train wreck nails.  \n\nThe salon offers complimentary mimosa's which in hindsight I wish I had indulged in one, but I passed. \n\nThings to note:\n\nThis is not a cheap place.  You are paying more for the ambiance than probably the quality.  It wasn't bad, but you can get  a cheaper everything if you go somewhere else.  That being said, I was staying at the hotel and enjoyed the convenience and was willing to pay more for it.\n\nThey automatically add in a 20% tip.  They do make you aware of this, but not until after your service.  I am sure it is posted somewhere, but I didn't know until it was point out when I went to pay.  \n\nI am looking forward to trying some of the spa services next time I stay at the hotel.  I was jealous of everyone walking around in bath robes looking so relaxed."
"1","It takes a lot for me to give a nasty review, and this place earns it.\n\nI was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the US met here to catch up (after 20 years!).  I have lived all over the world, and appreciate spa's of all sorts and facilities....and always the main thing comes back to service.\n\nFirst, the greeting here was nice.  We had reservations for our treatments and confirmed at the desk then went on the tour. The facilities are wonderful.  Very posh.  Beautiful pools, indoor and out, and the spa was relaxing and comfortable.\n\nNow with posh places, they can often miss the point of actual \""treatment\"".  But keep in mind I go to a Korean spa in Los Angeles and get an old lady to scrub me down like a little dirty kid so that my skin glows.  Still, I expect the actual treatment.\n\nSo I had a massage.  Can't go wrong with that - right?  Well....maybe you can.  I choose the only man on staff, as I like a strong massage.  I can honestly say that he spent more time adjusting my blanket a million times then he did actually rubbing me.  It was almost annoying.  I was ready to rip the blanket off.  I'm here for a rub down, not fluffy adjustment of the blanket and how it covers me LOL.  So whatever....\n\nWhen I got back I asked my friends if their treatments were nice.  All said \""ok\"" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain.  One did complain.  She said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment.  Oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit.  But she really wanted it.  Well it's not missing it that pissed me off....it's what the lady told her.  She basically told my friend \""well I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame cuz I do a really good treatment\"".  Well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever?  She should have taken the time to DO it!\n\nThen we go to pay.  Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.  Like I said, I've been to spas on every single corner of this earth, and never before have I seen this done.  They basically add a 20% gratuity.  They PRE add it.  Then they say to you \""well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it\"".  WOW WOW WOW!  So are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less?  \n\nSo first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad.  They said to her \""well you know the tip get's shared by all of us\"".  Oh my Lord.  \n\nMy turn.  I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats.  We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.  I paid and didn't fight.\n\nBut then...there was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too.  He said to the girl...\""what can I bitch about to try to get a discount?\"".  WOW.  Is this really how these locals act?  He didn't know our situation.  He didn't know how we were treated.  So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business.  The girl behind the counter LAUGHED.\n\nOh no.  In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager.  They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails.  NO call back.\n\nYou can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings, but the meat is your treatments and your service.  In my booked you failed on both."
"1","I treated my mom and myself to Sea Pearl Facials, Bottoms Up Pedicures, and Luxury Manicures on April 1st, 2014, at the Spa. I have lived in the Ballantyne area for years; however, this was my first visit to the Spa at Ballantyne. Overall, we were very satisfied with every service we received. We were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival. \n\nI personally had Leigh for my facial, and she was amazing. She talked with me at length about my skin type, the products that would work well, and the experience was incredibly relaxing. I have had facials before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My mom was equally satisfied with her service, and said she could have stayed on the table forever. \n\nI had Choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure. She was an expert, and sought to ensure comfort at every step! My mom and I had these together, and it was a great experience - relaxing, refreshing, and lots of good chatter. We had a beautiful view of the golf course, and were sipping complimentary Pomegranate Martinis during these services. I have not been doing a mani/pedi on a regular basis, but am considering adding this on a monthly basis. Choyoung was very welcoming, friendly, and efficient. \n\nThe only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout. After gathering our things from the locker room, we came back up to check out. My mother went into the shop to browse while I waited to pay. There was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk. There was a woman behind the desk also, not participating in the discussion, but seemed like she was politely listening. \n\nShe clearly saw us walk up, and my mother go into the shop. I stood there for a bit, expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member, she would respond but did not. I almost said 'excuse me', but given I do customer service for a living as well, I wanted to see how long she would ignore me. I continued to stand there, and finally she (Lindsey) greeted me. I must say she was the most cold and rude person I encountered at the Spa. She presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (I normally tip 20% and would have anyway, but it's nice for the customer to have that choice), and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts. It was almost as if I was a bother to her. After I received my receipt, I started to walk into the shop, and I heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude. \n\nAfter the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day, it was not something I expected at the end. It goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business. Additionally, I sent this feedback in e-mail to the Spa, and heard absolutely nothing from them...not even a 'sorry'."
"1","Over crowded, loud, and not a relaxing experience. Stayed at the hotel and booked two massages. Was looking forward to a tranquil  environment, sadly that did not happen. The service was below par and did not measure up to the quality of the hotel. I was not told about the facilities available, it was loud, crowded, I was told I could relax after massage with my husband, that did not happen, and checking in was not smooth. Sadly not worth the money or time."
"1","I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 6/14/14 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore.\nI was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes."
"2","This is the best Hampton Inn that I have ever stayed in. We love the magic behind the mirrors in the bathroom. The management and the staff are fantastic also. If any of our family comes to town, this is where they will stay."
"2","Lovely hotel. Big work desk to get stuff done on your laptop. High speed Internet. Pillow top bed so comfy. 3 TVs in double queen suites. You guess where the third tv is. Security safe in each room. Refrigerator, microwave, plenty of storage space, pull out couch (bed), and continental breakfast with SAUSAGE and waffles.  Waking distance to upscale shops, theater, restaurants (P.F. Chang crowded&wait)."
"2","Once again a Hampton Inn does not disappoint! This Hampton Inn & Suites at Phillips Place was beautiful and pristine! When we came in, there was someone playing the piano in the lobby! How welcoming! The staff member that checked us in was very friendly and informative about attractions in the area. Our room was spacious and elegantly decorated. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a nice addition. The TV in the room was set up to attach a PC/game system/DVD player. All you need is your device and the cable. Also, the WiFi is free! We were at this hotel for an extended stay (12 days) and I have to say that our room service was exceptional!! We weren't always up early and no matter what time we finally came out they managed to service our room and make everything fresh!! We have stayed other places that would skip our room if we came out late, but not here! The breakfast was great and there was something different most every day! The food service staff was very accommodating and friendly! ( We love the afternoon Otis Spunkmeyer cookies!) We didn't use the pool, but it looked clean and inviting! The patio area was charming and a great place for early morning coffee or late afternoon chats. I read some complaints about the parking, but we didn't find that to be much of a problem for us. We almost always found a spot around the back and used our room key to come in through the dining room area versus the lobby. No problem. AND the parking is free! There are several great restaurant choices within walking distance. During our 12 day stay went to Wolfgang Puck's Pizza Bar, The Palm, PF Changs, and Pinkberry for some frozen yogurt. Also, the movie theater was within walking distance. Also, there is a Whole Foods opening up right next door later in the summer!\nThe hotel was beautiful, well equipped, quiet, and a great value! We loved the staff, the convenient location, and would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family! Thanks for such a wonderful place to stay!"
"2","Attended a seminar at this hotel recently and found it to be a great place for a corporate event. The hotel lobby is nice and ballrooms are well equipped for all sorts of meetings. The only possible problem is parking - it seems that could be a bit of an issue if there is a lot going on at the time of your event."
"2","Very nice hotel. Had a King bed with a whirlpool tub. The best part was the tv in the mirror in bathroom. Hotel had complimentary tea, coffee and cookies. The reason I took a star off was because we prepaid with one credit card at a certain rate, and upon checkout were billed again for the night for a totally different rate. The front desk did finally take care of this. Also at breakfast there was no food ready and we had to wait about 15 mins. Other than that the hotel was very nice"
"2","i have never been in a hampton inn this nice!  it felt like a much higher end hotel - also cost more than the typical hampton inn.  i had a 1st floor room, private patio with table and chairs, beautiful room.  the neighborhood is nice, can walk and shop and explore - upscale shops and lots of nice places to dine.\nonly criticism is the fitness facility which was lame - 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 bench, dumbbells to 50 lbs.  no place to do situps, no yoga type mats, small and crowded room without a clock on the wall!"
"2","Both my colleague and I arrived at Hampton Inn & Suites to stay two nights.  He stayed on the 3rd floor and I was on the 4th floor, we both had magnificent suites.  I must say this is one of the best Hampton Inn's I have ever stayed in.  In fact, it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  The hotel location is conveniently located within walking distance of several restaurants and shops/boutiques.  There are also several businesses and a large mall nearby.  The hotel is 'grand' and the entrance is beautiful.  When I arrived to my room, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The updated open kitchen and living room combination were beautifully decorated and super clean.  The separate bedroom/bathroom were spacious.  The vanity near the bathroom even offered a built in vanity TV within the mirror!  We walked to PF Chang's Chinese Bistro for dinner, then walked over to Dean & DeLuca for a quick dessert.  \n\nBeautiful hotel with wonderfully convenient amenities.  The cost of the suites were high (we received a corporate rate), but very well worth the price.\n\nCons - limited nearby parking and one of the front desk clerks was rude to my colleague during check-in.  This rating would have been 5 stars had it not been for that check-in experience.  Bottom line, this hotel is definitely worth staying at again!\n\nCheers!"
"2","All the other reviews are true. This is one of the nicest Hampton Inns you will find. Very well decorated. Large beautiful rooms. Feels like a luxury hotel. The whirlpool and bathroom mirror tv are terrific touches. The staff was helpful and polite. It's in a terrific area with lots of great shopping and dining options. I literally have nothing negative to say about the hotel.\n\nHowever, the reason this isn't a 5 star review is because the night my wife and I stayed there, there was some kind of party going on at the restaurant right next door. They had a band that was playing ridiculously loudly until well past midnight. Needless to say, the incessant music did little to enhance what was meant to be a nice night out together.\n\nI hate holding this against the hotel as they had no control over it and the staff was very sympathetic, but it nonetheless significantly impacted our stay. I would recommend calling ahead before you book to find out if any parties have been scheduled, if that kind of thing bothers you. We really want to stay there again, and I assure you I will be calling.\n\nExcellent hotel, less than excellent experience. Too bad."
"2","As you pull down the promenade and approaching the hotel, you pass by some amazing shops, restaurants and a theater within walking distance.  The first thing that I noticed when I walked in past the giant fountain was the free wifi in the lobby.  Although wifi in the room is limited, short and slow.  The entrance is bright, open in a colonial style with piano and complimentary coffee, tea and cookies.  TV in the bathroom.  WOW!!  Not only that, but curved shower curtain and tiled shower.  The Neutrogena toiletries are a good touch.  The bedding was very comfortable.  Always love a free breakfast, but is also a great grocery and cafe next door.  Overall it is better than your typical Hampton with some great little touches."
"1","I've stayed at 3 Marriott properties this week and this is both the worst of the 3, and of any I've stayed at in at least a year.  \n\nThe location is bad (you hear the flights coming and going), there isn't good food  (non-hotel, non-fast food), within a reasonable walking area, the shuttle service is poor (35 minute wait for a 6 - 7 minute ride), the front desk was rude, the bar staff was very inexperienced, and as an elite member I still got stuck with a room with a funky odor next to the elevator.\n\nNext time I'll stay at a higher quality hotel further away from the airport."
"1","They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \""were already at the airport\"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns"
"1","Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work, went to the office and she did not even check my name!!!!.... Waited for the shuttle around 40 min at the airport.  Not even friendly people working there..."
"1","Scary awful. I needed a room by the airport for an early morning flight. I've always had good experiences in the past so I booked a room.\n\nThe first thing I see when I walk in the door is an angry woman named \""Chrystal\"" (refuses to give a last name) with a look on her face you only see on a bad day at the DMV or on a prison inmate. I think maybe she's having a bad day (or a bad life) so I smile anyway rather than doing what I should have done and headed straight out the door. The angry \""Chrystal\"" just continues to look like she found a turd in her lunchbox. \n\nI let angry Crystal know we are Rewards Members thinking this might soften her belligerent glare. No luck. After an agonizing minute of talking with her, I inform her I'm not happy with my interaction with her and ask for her manager. She denies a manager is available and then gives me the card of someone else who works there but is also not available. I later learn the person who's name she gave me is not the real manager at all. So angry Crystal is a liar on top of dedicating herself to creating misery in others through her toxic attitude. \n\nEmployees like Crystal are no doubt the reason this Marriott has the lowest yelp rating of any Marriott in the State. Whoever does the hiring at this hotel desperately needs basic training. They are asleep at the switch. \n\nIn short, there's a good reason this Marriott location has an extremely low rating."
"1","I would give this place a 0 star if I could! \nKYRA, the front desk customer service agent was very rude and not friendly at all!!\nI told her that I was a Platinum Marriott (1,100,000 points!) rewards member and she seemed to get very Argumentative  and defensive saying no I wasn't, I was only a silver member. I showed her my credit card, license and platinum rewards card and she never entered the number Or my credit card information apparently. (Which I found out after as you'll read below) I went to the room only to find a filthy carpet, lint balls in the bed,  a completely clogged bathroom sink and no extra towels soaps or shampoos in the tub area . They give you one small soap at this hotel! \nI called downstairs to let them know and the woman that answered the phone said that my name wasn't even listed for this room!!  \nApparently KYRA DIDN'T DO HER JOB and not only did not put my platinum rewards card into the computer, she also didn't even put my name or credit card on the room. What she did put in however it was my other  flight crew members credit card paying for both rooms. This cannot happen!!  I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN nor will my other crew members!  Unfortunately I was on only a nine hour layover and could not, or did not have the energy to argue with these people. I will make sure to get the word out to have no airline or corporate crews stay at this DUMP OF A HOTEL. I've stayed at some pretty shabby Motels better than this. But you know, with all the hundreds of Marriotts that I've stayed at, there always has to be one bad apple I suppose and Charlotte Courtyard Marriott,, you should be proud of earning the title of being that one bad apple. Between the rudeness. the inaccurate information entered into the computer, the filthiness of the room and the lack of routine maintenance I give this place a zero!! 00000"
"2","Real close to the airport. Modern rooms, comfortable beds, nice bistro downstairs in the lobby with a mini bar. All the staff we encountered was friendly. \n\nIt was nice to have a porch outside on the upper floors. There are chairs and tables out there. \n\nBathrooms are average."
"1","I had two dogs, fries, and a coke for lunch.  The cheese was the individually wrapped American slices torn in 1/2, the bun was your plain white basic variety, the chili right out of a can, and the meat typical. Frankly (haha), it didn't do anything for me.  Because of some of the other stellar reviews, I'll have to give it another try, maybe the green dogs?  Friendly enough with a small town diner ambiance."
"2","I have been going to Green's for 40 years and I haven't found a better dog yet! I have found some that were close though. There are a few folks that have mentioned on here that  the chili is from a can. I know for a fact that their chili is homemade! If it is from a can maybe someone can email me and tell me which brand it is so I can buy it. The things I like about the dogs are the steamed buns. That way they are moist and practically melt in your mouth. The franks are boiled and they are fat and juicy. \nThe onions are a sweet type like vidalia and they are choped real fine so they aren't lumpy. I usually get 2 all the way with a Pepsi. If you are looking for a really good hot dog I say give them a try and if you know of a better place let me know!"
"2","I try to eat healthy on most days, but sometimes you just want to be bad and scarf down a couple chili dogs. This is the place to go to fulfill that urge. \n\nGreen's is a Charlotte institution. An old school lunch counter that also offers burgers, sandwiches, crinkle fries, onion rings, etc... but the dog is the way to go here. Unless you are my pal Eddie, who swears by the livermush sandwich here.\n\nIt's nothing fancy. Just a lunch spot where you can get a hot dog done right. I suggest getting it slathered in Green's homemade chili.\n\nThere is a parking lot next to the building. It is a pay lot. I recommend parking on the street and feeding the meter instead.\n\nI guess my only real complaint about Green's is that it's not open on Sundays, unless the Panthers are at home."
"1","I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't."
"2","Old school diner, known for chili-dogs\n\nMost of the reviews here are on point.   We were there early so mostly had breakfast which was darned good.  I was not all that impressed with the chili-dogs frankly (sorry...pun).  \""Lost in time\"" type of diner.  Def worth a shot if you've never been."
"1","Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart??"
"1","This is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality.  Sure, it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades.  But the hot dogs aren't impressive at all, I was actually quite disappointed by them.  \n\nIn my order, I got two Carolina Style Dogs (mustard, onions, slaw and chili), with fries and a drink.  The drink is inundated with tons of ice, which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had.  The fries were so-so, nothing fancy about crinkle-cut.  The dogs were disappointing... since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot, they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well, they didn't do that and I had a soggy buns as a result.  The slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess.  Overall, I couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bun.\n\nHonestly, I have had better hot dogs from the Green's lunch cart located in front of Wells Fargo than the actual location.  Prices are the same, cheap, and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns.  If you want Green's lunch, go to the cart, not the establishment.  Overall, there are better hot dog places in Uptown, though will cost more."
"1","Didn't see too much in particular that I loved about this place. It is very small, and is truly a \""grab and go\"" kind of place amongst the shops in Uptown. Considering all of the other coffee shops in the area you can find, I would probably skip here and go somewhere else."
"1","From the burned up bagels to the Stepford Wives, glazed over look of the staff, I will no longer be degrading myself by going to Jackson's Java. Today was the last straw. After paying for my muffin (with nobody else in line mind you) the staff began to chit chat, all the while I just stood there with my hands folded and no muffin. By the time someone uttered \""What's he waiting on\"" I had already began my exit. Fair food, fair coffee, horrible customer service, I would recommend seeking out the nearest Starbucks and avoid Jackson's Java like the plague."
"2","Located next to the lobby area of Well Fargo 3, this little coffee shop is fantastic. They always seem to have unique roasts from the world's most popular coffee regions. I'm not sure who does the roasting or where they buy their beans but it is easily better than Caribou and Starbucks.\nI have only had two of the pastry offerings and they were also worth the money as a breakfast. It is kind of tucked away but if you are on that side of Uptown, consider trying to find it. You won't be disapointed."
"2","They are undergoing a change to their rewards program, be VERY careful that they moved your rewards over, I am missing a LOT of drinks. \n\nThe selections of coffee is good, like that they have almond milk and a variety of sugar free syrups. They will also sell whole bottles of syrup, which I really appreciate!\n\nBaked goods are usually fresh and I like that you can get plain oatmeal or jazz it up with certain toppings. \n\nStaff seems to turn over quickly, which I dislike, but they are typically friendly hipsters who take pride in making a great drink."
"2","This is an excellent, boutique hotel for anyone who has business or pleasure travel in Uptown Charlotte. It's right in the heart of the uptown commercial district, so if your business is there, you can park the car and walk to your destination. \n\nThe accommodations are beautiful and comfortable. The staff is friendly and fairly formal, but not over-the-top. I've heard the hotel restaurant is great, and features ingredients from local farms, but I haven't tried it yet. \n\nThe Dunhill is not cheap but my company has a group rate which I am happy to take full advantage of. And I also prefer an independent, boutique hotel over a nondescript chain."
"2","This place is great. It's an old building but they really make it work and don't fight their limitations at all.  It's well located, there's a bar in the lobby (watch yourself, that guy pours em stiff), and the staff give a crap.  The only drawback is the parking situation ...and it's a little hard to actually drive to the building itself, given the whole \""crazy series of one-way streets\"" in downtown Charlotte.  But yeah, I thought it was fantastic all around - oh, and the price for it all is great."
"1","My husband and I visited the Dunhill, originally planning to spend our wedding night there. They are historic, quaint, and conveniently located in Charlotte. Walking in to the check-in desk was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel. It really could use some restoring. The hotel room was small, bathroom was small as well (though they've tried to modernize it with decoration & hardware), and just overall underwhelming. The ceiling had many water spots where water had leaked from above and dried the ceiling yellow. They also have a restaurant in the hotel with good eggs benedict, but for the price, I wasn't impressed. Again, friendly, great historic hotel (which I normally love), but didn't live up to its reputation for us. (We visited before our wedding and booked a room at the Ritz, which in Dunhill's defense, was brand spankin' new.)"
"1","We booked through Hotwire while in town for a bowl game under their hot rate, so you don't know what hotel you get until after you pay for it.  Let's just say if you like small rooms with a small bed, in a small historical hotel with only apx 65 rooms then this is your place.  They had no king size beds or rooms with two double beds available in the rooms they had left.  Location was decent, but prefer to be closer to the action near more restaurant selection."
"2","If I could give 10 stars I would!  This hotel went above and beyond when my Uncle fell ill and had to be hospitalized while visiting Charlotte.  They used their London Cab to come and pick us up at the hospital even though it was out of their cab range.  They also gave me a discounted rate on another room so I could stay in Charlotte and take care of my Uncle.  Now on to the hotel itself, it is gorgeous!  The rooms are spacious and so quiet.  I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors in the two different rooms I stayed in.  The complimentary breakfast is on point!  Look no further if you are looking for a place in Charlotte that will make you feel like you are part of their family."
"2","This review is just for the bar, as I am local and live in Charlotte.  I highly recommend locals and hotel guests alike to stop into the Dunhill bar for a drink.  Pete, the bartender, is the BEST and will take good care of you!  He mixes up some amazing cocktails and provides spot-on recommendations if you need them."
"1","Stayed here overnight while visiting for the Liverpool-AC Milan game. \n\nArrived at 3:30pm but the room wasn't even ready despite check in being 3pm. \n\nBed in room wasn't a queen size it was a full size so this is false advertising. I know this for a fact as we just changed from a full size to a queen size bed at home so we are aware of the size difference. In addition the mattress was very soft and the bed frame felt like it might fall apart any time - so we didn't have a great night's sleep which made the 7 hour drive home tough!\n\nA/C unit on wall glowed bright blue all through the night, there was no way to turn off the glow without turning off the A/C which would have made the room too hot.\n\nRoom itself was small but nice enough, I appreciate this is a downtown hotel so you don't get value for money at those type of hotels, but still we personally cannot recommend it."
"2","the hotel meets the proper standard marriot network and meet the expectations. is in a good location, the city requires car or taxi for transportation. cleaning and hotel services also left me satisfied."
"2","the location of the motel is excellent, next to the walk of fame. The presence of good parking. The rooms are typical motel but the thing to remember is the cleanliness of the rooms which is not very accurate (the extractor fan in the bathroom had dust that almost completely otturava). Needless to say, not a hotel to go with small children. In fact, even though we had specifically asked the cradle in the reservation made one month in advance, no one to check in told us that they did not have cots. Breakfast is completely forgettable, better do it for a fee at the nearby Starbucks."
"2","We booked this hotel as we want to watch the Xmas Lakers game. It is close enough to walk and right in the middle of NC  downtown.\nThe area is not as I expected as te downtown looks doggy and the hotel also show some age.\nRestaurant very limited and not too many good food around."
"2","This boutique hotel is hard to beat. Decent prices for a great experience. Excellent location in the center of everything: within a 5 block radius, there are dozens of wine bars, eateries, nice restaurants, and even clubs & lounges.\n\nTheir rooms have good wifi, free sodas and water bottles in their fridge, and they sometimes come during the evenings with free mini Ghirardelli chocolates to hand out. Rooms also stocked with luxurious bath towels and robes.\n\nBeds were comfy, albeit on the softer side. Linens were crisp and clean. The restroom was super spacious and decked out in white & grey marble. \n\nThey offer free breakfast  that starts at 6:30AM, as well."
"2","If you are rolling down Highway 277 and you see this giant building, you may easily mistake it for a church.  The beautiful stone walls of this artistic chapel drew me in automatically.  I came here for the show called True Grit: Frames, Fixations and Flirtations, which is a blend of woodwork and other types of craft with art.  The exhibit was very interesting and I would recommend checking it before Nov. 1st.  The center itself is pretty breathtaking with wood planks holding up the building and a great view of the city through it's long windows.  I have several friends who do woodwork, so I enjoyed this exhibit very much."
"2","Turns out the old, burned down looking church at the end of Tryon and 11th is actually a great museum for Visual Art - who knew! Yes, this gem of a museum in our city is pretty frickin' cool if you ask me. From the ultra sleek modern interior, to the industrial and raw materials that you'll see showcased throughout the exhibits, the McColl Center boasts some pretty cool urban exhibits along with a really enthusiastic volunteer staff! Jason is my favorite guide and they're always excited to talk with you about the current exhibits, history of the church and what's coming next - a rareity if you've been to the sleepy new Mint Uptown (I find their staff a bit bored which is a shame with all the awesome stuff they have in that place!).\n\nDo yourself a favor and stop in this place - it's a gem here in Charlotte!"
"2","We went to the Mcninch House last Wednesday for yet another work dinner (no complaints here)!! There was 5 of us in our party and we had this beautiful Old Victorian House to ourselves!! We were the only reservation they had that evening the server insisted they were fully booked the rest of the week though!\n\nIf you have never been or never heard of them before, they ask for you and your party to call in how many courses and what entree choice you would like the day before so that they can plan a menu specifically for your party. We opted for the \""Premiere\"" which was the 5 courses for $79 each.\n\nThe house was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree in each room each with a different theme. Very warm and of course a lot of history! \n\nI chose the Braised Coq au Vin  wrapped in Prosciutto served with couscous and a mushroom reduction...it was dry edible but dry. I only got that so that everyone was eating something different! I should have chosen the Osso Bucco!! Everyone else loved their entrees!!  I really enjoyed everything that they served before it. I just was not blown away by any of it.\n\nI feel that the ambiance was what really won me over and if I were ever to go back it would again be on my Boss' dime!!"
"1","I am going to keep this simple. My wife and I ate dinner at the McNinch house for our 5 year anniversary. The place was so slow. The valet guy was our waiter and bus boy. (probably the chef also, but not positive) The food was ok at the best. $300 and we both left and ate pizza. Enough said?"
"2","My wife and I went for our anniversary the year before last, but as other reviewers have stated, I remember the experience like it was yesterday.  For a proper experience be prepared to pay in excess of $200 per person for the entrees and wine pairing.  My wife and I opted for the Chef's tasting menu, which if memory serves me correct was 9 courses.  I highly recommend this choice, what is an extra $20 per person when you are already spending so much?  It really is about the experience... and Ellen and company make it an excellent, nay, perfect experience!"
"1","Came here for a private function/total buy-out with about forty people and was a bit disappointed.  This was not a four star dining experience.  It was a very pleasant service experience, friendly and not too stuffy and you could tell they really have a lot of pride for the place.  I actually feel bad about giving them a negative review because they seem like really nice people.  \n\nAnd the house is very old and interesting but that's not the definition of four star. Grandma's china and chilled forks and old fashioned service was adequate but certain things just put it off; like the dingy rugs in the bathroom and the shabby landscaping and I don't know what all actually.  Just felt a little amateurish.\n\nI did really enjoy the pear salad but the mushroom soup starter was cold and what really loses the stars for me is the mediocre entree of undercooked pork and tough steak.  Really disappointing.  I loved the sweet potato puree that came with it but it was the only flavor on the plate.  And that undercooked pork was inedible and I don't even mind a little pink.  This was raw in the center and mine wasn't the only one.  No one wanted to complain as it was a customer event.  But I would have sent it back if I were on my own.\n\nThe desert was your typical banquet style flourless chocolate cake but no coffee was offered.  Which may have been the planners fault but I really could have used some.\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience but doesn't live up to the reviews or the price tag.  My guess is they do much better for a standard service rather than a banquet service of 40 people."
"1","We had a 5-course meal and wine pairings.  The wine is why I gave it 2-stars; otherwise would've been worse as food was very bland.  No creativity to the cooking.  I enjoy extremely nice meals but McNinch is way overpriced for what you get."
"2","Bored at night at the Double Tree near the bus station in Charlotte I needed a better place to hang out.  Tired of hotel bars and expensive consultant watering pools I found myself looking for a out of the way neighborhood bar.\n\nEnter a young woman I met on a flight from BWI to CLT.  She told me about a cool neighborhood bar with 10 minutes of the hotel.  I sat on this information for  two weeks until last evening when I gave in and took a walk. \n\nLocated in some cool neighborhood that I have no idea where in Charlotte is a really great bar with a very laid back atmosphere and genuine customers.  \n\nYou enter the establishment and it takes you back to those old European bars in Amsterdam.  Dark, unassuming and quaint.  Service was top notch, and the food was excellent.  I have the Vegetarian Burger on Texas Toast with onions and tomato.  Pretty good in my book.  Done just right.  I topped it off with 2 Amstel Lights and some good conversation.  \n\nI need to find more places like this.  The great thing about A.M is it is not that easy to find.  And in this busy world we all live in t A.M is the place I want to be.\n\nThanks Airtran girl, much appreicated!\n\nwww.almikes.net"
"2","It's a neighborhood place in one of Charlotte's nicest neighborhoods....the Fourth Ward.  The food is good.  The service is good.  The setting is GREAT!"
"2","Just wow. If you ever come to Charlotte, go to the 4th Ward... its one of the most interesting downtown residential neighborhoods I've ever been in. When you go there, make sure you stop in here for some fantastic people watching and great beers. \n\nSeriously, walking here transports you completely away from the hustle and bustle and rowdiness of Tryon."
"2","Al Mike's is my favorite neighborhood bar in Charlotte, NC.  The only problem with it is that its too far away from my house!  :)  It is a treat to visit the 4th ward.  Great food, drinks, and company!"
"2","3.5 stars overall..bumped up to a 4 for being...\""cozy\"".. as one of my friends put it.  Solid food and a good place to start out a night.  A good way to get away from all the new and experience something with true Charlotte style."
"2","The food is OK, but the selling point is it is one of the few places in Charlotte that has culture and history.  An old victorian building in a neighborhood that feels more like Charleston than Charlotte.  Tired of uptown chains and overprices bistros, head to this place.  Great beer selection and a pub feel make this a great pick."
"2","Cute little bar tucked away in the 4th ward neighborhood.  Fun atmosphere - and apparently a big pole in the middle of the women's bathroom (see back of menu).  \n\nHad the nachos, fried pickles and the crawfish burrito, all of which were tasty."
"2","Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte."
"2","This place is great for a chill dinner and drinks. A very laid back atmosphere makes it perfect for dinner before heading out or just relaxing all night. It has a bar atmosphere without the crazy drunks and extremely loud crowd. The food isn't 5 star, but you can never go wrong with Fried Pickles and the What It Is. YUM!"
"2","Nice food selections, great drinks of course.\n\nGreat fourth ward place. My beef here is the lighting is just TOO dark. Cain't see the dang menus or nuthin! But a fine neighborhood bar.\n\nAnd fried pickles!!!"
"2","LOVE everything about this place.  Great atmosphere, great date place, great bar, and great food!  You must try the nachos!  Everything on the menu is good, and they have Warsteiner on tap!"
"2","One of my favorite spots in Charlotte. Definitely a locals spot. They have the best wings in town (Texas wild wings). They remembered my name after my first trip. Can't say enough about the place. Check it out."
"2","We had one night to go out to dinner during our recent Charlotte visit, and Al Mike's is where my friend wanted to take us.  Of course, I had to look up the reviews on Yelp before I agreed, and once I did, I was sold.  \n\nAnd now that I've been, I must say, Charlotte Yelpers, you are right on with this one!\n\nI love this incredibly charming historic restaurant and the 4th Ward neighborhood that surrounds it.  AM's atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Luckily, we arrived early on Saturday night (around 6:30), so we didn't have to wait for a table... (The restaurant did, however, fill up within a half hour).\n\nThe highlights in my eyes:\n*great beer selection!\n*fried pickles! \n*burger\n*onion rings\n\nIt was my first time ever trying fried pickles, and I'm a fan!  We devoured them as an appetizer for the table.  \n\nWe weren't huge fans of the crab soup, and I'd stay away from salads... they are nothing special.\n\nThe service was attentive with a snap of attitude.  I think they probably are friendlier toward their regulars, but that's fine by me.  If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular too!"
"2","I've been to Alexander Michael's a few times now and always have a great time.  It has a ton of character - tucked away on a little street of old houses in the 4th ward.  The wait staff is always friendly, there is a nice beer selection and I hear the food is good too (though I've never tried it).  The dining area takes up a large portion of the space and consists of very intimate, cozy booths and tables with dim lighting.  I believe it closes at 11, so it lends itself to a more relaxed crowd."
"2","Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!"
"2","Luckily for me, this restaurant is only a five-minute walk from work so it's always one of my top choices for lunch. The London Broil sandwich wasn't as medium-rare as I'd ordered, but delicious nonetheless. \n\nOne thing I appreciate about this restaurant is the frequency of daily-specials they offer during lunch. Everytime I've gone, they've offered at least two specials of the day, which shows some kitchen character. I'll definitely be back again."
"2","One of my favorite places to eat in Uptown. My go to dishes are the London broil entree and the what it is. Tried out most of the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The daily specials are usually pretty great as well."
"2","One of my Favorite Resturants in Charlotte try the What it is you won't be disapointed !!"
"2","Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.\n\nMy dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since, fried pickles don't exist in CA, I loved eating them while I was out in Charlotte.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would eat at this place again.   ;o)"
"2","One of the best spots in all of Charlotte.  Great for business lunches.  The london broil sandwich is one of the best steak sandwiches I have ever had.  Nice atmosphere and good beer selection too."
"2","There's something about the simplicity of this place, and the friendliness of the staff, that keeps bringing me back here. Since I've moved to Charlotte, I've tried the fried  pickles at almost every restaurant I've been to, and I have to say.. the ones at Alexander Michael's are among the top three in this city! The food is simple and tasty (even if you just want a simple garden burger, Cajun fried & a blue moon!) The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. It's a great place to visit even on a Monday evening!"
"2","Great atmosphere great service great food!! Charlotte charm."
"2","Such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner. Their Fried pickles are amazing and have an awesome beer selection! This is my go to place for a fun relaxing evening dinner uptown."
"1","I'm going to be the odd person and not give this place a glowing review.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is actually cool.  This is a true pub.  Beautiful dark wood is everywhere.  The staff is also very nice, no complaint there.\n\nThe thing is, I don't really have a complaint, I'm just not impressed with the food.  I find it acceptable, but nothing special.  In fact, the menu is, to me, kinda boring.  I think the point of this place is more to go \""have a few\"" after work and such.  When looking for great food in uptown, this place wouldn't make my list.  I do love that it's locally owned and operated, however, and harbor no ill feelings."
"2","I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was inviting, and the food was good. We had the nacho appetizer which was big enough for both of us. The black beans with all the salad yummies could have been a meal in itself. No room for dessert!"
"2","This place is amazing. It is a hidden restaurant right in uptown Charlotte. \n\nThe food is amazing. The drinks are amazing, especially the beer selection. It is also a very good place for date night, bro night, or just night. It is so good. :D\n\n Parking is on the street and it is only for two hours without permit. Just FYI. :D"
"2","Perfect hole in the wall, true pub. The half pound burger is maybe the best I've ever had and the selection of local brews is the perfect compliment. If you are a local looking for a \""regular spot,\"" or a tourist looking for that \""place only the locals know about,\"" Al Mike's is it!"
"2","In Charlotte for business and wanted some good local fair.  Fired up the Yelp and see Alexander Michael's getting awesome scores.  The map says 1.5 miles away and I don't have a car - going to have to hoof it.\n\nShow up about 7:30pm on a Wed.  Place wasn't crowded at all and I got sat right away.  The staff was nice.  I ordered the Fried Pickles as an appetizer.  Some people say they are too salty and I say, \""Well, they're pickles.\""  They get paired up with a cup of ranch, but I think they would have been better with Blue Cheese.  Hint: use just a little ranch on your fried pickle.\n\nNext up was a bowl of Spicy Crab Soup.  This is pretty much an enchilada soup with crab meat in it.  Not that that's a bad thing.  It's good soup.  But spicy?  No.  No it is not.\n\nMain course is the Blackened Catfish Sandwich.  This right here is what I'm talking about.  The filet is a monster.  A tasty, flakey monster.  They pair it up with a tarter sauce (did I detect a pepper in there?  Chipotle maybe?) and some kind of other sauce that was like a chunky salsa/sweet-n-sour thing.  Doesn't matter.  I dumped both of them on.  It was tasty as all get out.  I devoured the enormous sandwich. The side dish I chose was the Broccoli Slaw and honestly, it tasted like 'healthy'.  Skip it.  Do the cajun fries instead."
"2","The spicy crab soup and the chicken leek  soup were delicious and I suspect homemade. The Ruben washed down with the Mecktoberfest beer was a good combo.  Very good lunch and would come back to try the dinner menu."
"2","This a wonderful neighborhood bar and restaurant!  The type place you can find in Atlanta or other large city.  The food is very good and the service is excellent.  The draft beer selection is good.  I highly recommend this place."
"2","My family and I were in Charlotte, North Carolina and decided to stop here because of Yelp. As it turns out this was the best restaurant wr have been to in a while. Quality food, large portions, relatively fast seating, and great service."
"2","We've been to Alexander Michaels a few times and love it each time. I find it to be romantic and quant. Our last trip was on Valentine's Day. We arrived early as they are first come first serve even on Holidays.  We started out with two beers and an order of potato wedges. The bacon and cheese covered dish was delicious and I'd get it again (without tomatoes).  For my entree I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with Cajun Fries and my husband had the London Broil Sandwich. We both enjoyed our meal and would recommend both menu items. We did not have any dessert this time, so can't comment on that. Our server was very nice and had a to-go box waiting for me before I had to ask. I would recommend visiting Al Mikes with out-of-towners, after work drinks or a romantic dinner date. It has the d\u00e9cor of a tavern, is very dim and crowded inside. You can tell the neighborhood loves this place because like other Charlotte favorites we've found it packed all the time. Enjoy!"
"1","Bad food. Bug problem. In a neighborhood full of homeless roaming the streets like zombies."
"2","Was taking the famous Fourth Ward Secret Gardens Tour on this beautiful Sunday....which was awesone by the way. Saw that Alexander Michaels was open for this event. Was immediately greeted by Cooper, the host and owner's son. And yes ladies he is a \""hunk.\"" And a hell of a nice guy too! I shared some of the other female Yelp reviews with him and he laughed.\n\nDue to the other Yelp reviews I started with the fried pickles. Theirs were very lightly battered so you can actually TASTE the pickles! I thought that was great, along with the standard Ranch dipping sauce.\n\nCooper recommended the Penne Athena which was a nice, light chicken dish with black olives, red peppers and a light mushroom cream sauce. Very tasty and indeed not too heavy following my walkibg tour. \n\nOverall very good! Cooper, Milt at the bar were super gracious and friendly hosts! Can't wait to come back to try their 4th Ward Stroganoff."
"2","Looking for a neighborhood restaurant, with great service, fun environment. This is worth your trip. Be sure to park the car near the neighborhood park/playground."
"2","Brought family here from out of town and glad we did. Service and food were great. Staff was welcoming and the bartender helped us find beers our guests would like. Server made good, honest suggestions about the menu and checked on us throughout the night.  We will definitely be back."
"2","Perfect atmosphere. Best BLT, fried pickles and pasta salad(with Stevie's dressing.) One of my favorites in Charlotte."
"2","I came here for lunch this week on a business lunch with two other people. I had never heard of Alexander Michael's until a client recommended it. It is situated in a house just a couple blocks from the heart of Uptown. The environment inside is very pleasant and homey. It has a true neighborhood pub feel. The service was excellent, even during the busy lunch rush. \n\nI got the london broil sandwich and it was tasty. My coworker highly enjoyed the buffalo chicken sandwich. My client got the chicken pita which he really liked a lot. He opted for the pasta salad as a side and said it was great.\n\nI want to come back sometime to try out the dinner options!"
"1","I don't know what the hype is. I ordered steak which came out luke warm and over salted. It seemed old. Also my veggies weren't seasoned at all and were not even steamed. Not interested in returning."
"2","My husband and I went for lunch here and we loved it! It's located in a great location uptown and the service was great! My husband enjoyed the wings and I had a fantastic sandwich! Can't wait to go back and experience during dinner."
"1","I wish the GPS had been right about the derelict building it had initially brought me to....I would have been happily on my way to a satisfying meal elsewhere.....perhaps a place that doesn't have two legal parking places in a 5 block radius ....one of which is occupied by the restaurants mascot. An old beat up pick up truck....which seems to have avoided citation for 20 years. \n\n When this gem was recommended to me as a fantastic \""seasonal\"" restaurant, I wanted to call them immediately and ask them what season we were in that served these nasty, cold, ..\nOh but \""smoked\""quesadillas .  or perhaps when a good time of the year it was to enjoy this warm on the outside...cold on the inside tuna melt.  The waitress seemed shocked that one could possibly eat it any other way.   \n\n About 2/3 through the meal, we were asked to settle up...because at that time of day... Something with their computers demanded them to stop all service... And start a new tab.\n\n \n\n Nothing special on this menu.... Overrated pub grub."
"1","First of all, I came with an open mind.  Read the other reviews, thought it was a quaint place.  Great place for a couple of drinks and some appetizers.  The food, on the other hand, is NOT good.\n\nSpicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it.  It wasn't even spicy.  Not creamy, more gelatin in consistency.   Please, pass on it.\n\nThe London Broil arrived medium well, instead of medium rare.  Figured it was my error at being maybe misunderstood.  No, the waiter was quick to tell me I ordered medium rare.  Took it back and returned with medium rare on the rare side, just the way I like it.  By now, my companions had finished eating.  The meat was so tough, I gave up after a few pieces.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nParking issue.  There is a parking lot two doors before the restaurant. There is street parking all around if you arrive early enough.  Personally it won't be an issue because I won't be venturing back anytime soon.  \n\nDon't understand the hype. It a neat place. More of the neighborhood bar.  Not a good dinner place."
"2","The food here is great.  Diane the waitress is wonderful.  Of course all of Peter's family are great too.  His daughter waited on us and she was fantastic.  I love my Greek Omelette with Gyro!!  Thanks Diane for having my breakfast ready everyday.  See you soon."
"2","Looking for something entertaining to do with family visiting from out-of-town, I took them to the Levine Museum of the New South.  It was my first visit, too, and I enjoyed the exhibits and seeing a cultural part of the city that I hadn't seen before. \n\nTheir permanent exhibit is \""Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers\"" about the history of North Carolina and the way its changed from its beginnings.  It was very informative and by far the best exhibit we saw that day.  I loved the lifesize stores and rooms you can walk through to really get a feel of what it was like to live in NC from the Civil War to the present.  It was also a great history lesson in civil rights and how its evolved over the past 150 years or so.  We easily spent the better part of an entire afternoon there and felt good about doing so."
"2","Was there a time before Charlotte had banks,NFL football, Bojangles, and sprawling suburbs? YES.  Would you have known that by driving around this city? Not likely.  The Levine Museum of the New South is the antidote to an otherwise historically-deprived city.  The gorgeous facility on 6th St is worth a trip from visitors and residents alike. \n\nThey have a permanent exhibit called \""From Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers\"" and some substantial moving displays.  The permanent exhibit traces the history of Charlotte from the Civil War to the present-day.  Not a history buff?  No problem.  They have interactive displays, like a sharecropper's shack, a Belk's Dept. Store from the 1940's, and a faux church sanctuary among other stations.  You won't be bored.  This museum has really changed how I view Charlotte.  Even as a native NC who grew up thinking Charlotte was fabled cosmopolitan city, I was surprised to see how recently Charlotte had a small-town culture.  The past two to three decades of growth have left few vestiges of the old South.   \n\nThe Levine Museum has a focus on social history.  Therefore, the exhibits give you a sense of culture, not mere facts and dates.  Unless you visit, you can't really wrap your head around ,the growth in the last part of the 20th and 21st century, understand what \""gentrification\"" and development has done to the historical character of the city, and how newcomers have vastly changed the cultural landscape.  You'll understand that Charlotte is really rich in history, but that history hasn't been well-preserved.  Admission is a mere $6.  Some Sundays are free and Bank-of-America cardholders can go for free one weekend a month.  Don't miss this opportunity to glimpse the past."
"2","Whether you're native or a newcomer to Charlotte, I would highly recommend a trip to Levine Museum of the New South.  It focuses mainly on the post Civil War history of Charlotte all the way up until present day.  They keep the recent stuff pretty up to date too.  The permanent exhibit and main feature is called \""Cottonfields to Skyscrapers.\""  I've been through it a few times, but they always add on some new stuff to the end of it.  There is definitely some interesting history here.  I never new that Ford made cars over on Statesville Ave for example.  You'll also learn the the reason why downtown is called uptown (hint- locals called it \""uptown\"" as far back as the 50s - before it was a trendy term).  You'll also learn why the streets change name every 2 miles.  This is where my current profile picture was taken.\n\nThe second floor features temporary exhibits, and right now they have brought back \""Courage: The Carolinas Story That Changed America.\""  The first lawsuit filed for degregation was filed in Clarendon County, SC.  This and four subsequent cases led up to \""Brown vs Board of Education.\""  \n\nThe museum isn't huge, but it's not tiny either.  I'd say it takes about 2.5 to 3 hours to get through it if you've never been.  Some kids may be bored as it's not too interactive.  If you haven't been here, go.  It''s only $6 for adults."
"2","Very objective and incredibly well written. Deceptively large and packed with with information.\n\nPrepare to take at least an hour and be ready for a history that pulls no punches. The truth hurts and so everything from slavery and the life of the poor farmer to the whole lynching dedicated exhibit is incredibly intense and gripping.\n\nA great inspiration."
"2","LEVINE MUSEUM OF THE NEW SOUTH\nWhen you're in Charlotte, North Carolina, make sure you stop by the Levine Museum of the New South. It's a great spot to learn more about the city and state... and how it went from a rural farming state supporting slavery to become the 2nd largest banking business in the country. There is an excellent video that they show that details the days of slavery and then Reconstruction to the modern day banking industry. The museum also showcases racism in the 1960s, but shows now that the state is very multi-cultural. It's a wonderful museum that shows a lot and tells a wonderful story about the history of North Carolina: past, present, and future. Stop by to learn more!"
"2","I don't know that I've ever been so impressed with the layout and thoroughness of a museum. I usually get dragged to them because my mom is such a fan and has to hit at least one in every town we visit, but I have to say I'm glad we visited this one. \n\nI learned a lot and got a whole new perspective on the area. \n\nDefinitely recommend if you're a museum lover!"
"2","I enjoyed myself here, but wasn't really impressed. The museum was just as racially biased as the bigot, city of Charlotte, mentality is. The museum had some interesting facts and interesting exhibits though. My children seemed to enjoy it. It didn't hurt that it was free and parking was validated. That is also the case every Sunday. They close at 5 on Sunday, so get there before 4. The exhibit is an hour long."
"1","The queen of the bloated corporate steakhouses!  Save your money.....find a local street vendor.....and buy tickets to whatever is at the Blumenthal!!"
"1","Yawn.\n\nI've eaten 2 meals at mortons and honestly - I can do better at home. Sure the food was good - but dropping $100+ dollars and not being thoroughly impressed isn't my idea of great value.\n\nSave you're $ go buy a steak and a $20 bottle of wine at the Harris Teeter and fire up your grill - you'll pay 30 bucks and have just as good of a meal."
"2","It was the bar specials sign that gave me a craving for sliders while walking home from work one night.  My husband and I went in for Cheeseburger sliders and Petite Filet  Mignon sandwiches.  Combine this with the drink specials and you have a winning combination.\n\nThe bar area is cozy and separated from the main dining area in it's own room.  The dark wood and warm colors make it an inviting place for a small bite (though portions were a meal size for me).  There are a couple tables, a few high tops and a decent amount of seating at the bar."
"2","5+ stars!  And this coming from a girl who \""does not\"" eat steak!  The seafood is outstanding.  Shrimp Alexander is divine, Crab cakes are heavenly and the molten hot chocolate cake is to die for!!!\nMy husband thoroughly enjoys the steaks each and every time we go.  YUM!"
"1","I'm sorry but what is the big deal?!? I can get great steak for a lot less $$. And everything is ala carte! No way. I was not impressed by anything here. Ruth's Chris is better! But quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments."
"2","saying this place is very, very good is not giving it justice.  it is not as good as capital grille, but man is it close. again , bring 300 bucks, if you cannot afford it, don;'t go.  go to longhorns."
"2","What can I say? This is beef euphoria in wine heaven! Always consistent , always delectable, always special treatment ."
"1","We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans, which happened to be the wrong style for the hostess at Morton's. After checking in with the girl at the front an unnamed judgmental man who sat us at our table made a judgmental comment \""Oh jeans I see...\"" making both my girlfriend and I uneasy and uncomfortable about the rest of our experience. \n\nThe drinks were average and the steaks were good, but not fabulous. In fairness, our waiter was very friendly, though.\n\nUnfortunately, our friendly waiter was not enough to overcome our bad initial impression.  I expected better, especially at a nice restaurant like this.\n\nWhen people are attempting to come into your establishment and spend over $150 on dinner, you should do whatever you can to make them feel as comfortable as possible.  Now I am sure never to return back to Morton's and I tell everyone I know about my negative experience."
"2","Fantastic steak. Gentlemen's club decor. Professional service. Valet parking. Expensive."
"1","I recently dined here for my anniversary and was deeply disappointed by the service.  Placed in a high traffic area; dirty dishes left on table; drinks not re-filled; server  not familiar with menu and special pricing; Did not get order right; I have expressed my concerns to Landry's and to the restaurant directly, and have been ignored.  The service here does not match the high prices."
"1","This was a terrible horrible experience this evening and I will never go to this Mortons again. I was sitting in the bar when a guy in dirty jeans and a t-shirt was so drunk at the bar he fell off his bar stool and I had to pick up the stools. I decided this situation was not going to get better so I left before ordering.  I walked out and phoned the manager and told him that I was upset that they served this guy until he was totally intoxicated and could not even walk out of there.  He apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone.  I walked up and he was still staggering around outside and I walked in.  Rich said he was sorry and I sat back at the bar and he wanted to buy me an appetizer and a drink and I said okay.  The bartender never came back to me to take my drink order.  I decided to leave and the manager was outside still trying to take care of the situation with the drunk with the police. He saw me leave and I shook his hand and said thanks anyway and I walk away and when all else fails HOOTERS makes a mean chicken wing but would of rather had my Filet and Broccoli\n\nOh Well"
"2","Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order, every time. We have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered, entrees to side dishes or deserts. Its all high quality food and super delicious. Whenever my husband and I get to treat ourselves we always choose Morton's, we love it!"
"2","Here for a birthday dinner for my fiance and having been to a few other Morton locations I knew what I was in store for.  And that is delicious steaks, insane deserts and outstanding service.  At least those are the things I always walk away from the place remembering.\n\nThis location is no different, great staff and comfortable atmosphere to relax with no rush to dining.\n\nThe parking is pretty non existent here so I suggest valet."
"2","The food and service was excellent. Our sever Tara was on point. She was very knowledge. The restaurant is going through some remodeling and it gives it a more modern look. I enjoy everything and will be back"
"1","Poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality. Nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive. I would recommend Capital Grille over Morton's."
"2","best steak EVER  EVER  EVER\ncajun rib eye ......juicy .. tasteful .... cooked to perfection\n\ngreat service \n\nafter bad experience at McCormick & Schmick's ... it was completely the opposite here\n\nCody was my server ... happy guy with outgoing personality .. attentive but not overbearing....\n\nthe manager was exceptional .......\n\npricey but well with it\n\nCody recommended the fresh spinach salad .. I'm not a salad guy but this was exceptional, diced salad and vinaigrette, chopped bacon, diced egg .....it was great!!\n\nif there are better steaks .... i'm truly scared to eat them.\n\nN -  JOY!"
"2","I was in Uptown for an all-day meeting and looking for someplace to go on my lunch break.  I decided to give Matt's Chicago Dog a try because I've always noticed the crowds, I love hot dogs, and I love Chicago (I'm a sucker for marketing).  \n\nThe menu was a lot more extensive than I was expecting and I felt a bit overwhelmed, like being the new kid coming into a school halfway through the year.  Everyone walking in knew what they wanted and how to order.  I, on the other hand, felt like I had to go back to Ordering Food 101.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and accommodating, though, and walked me through the process.  I still felt stupid, but at least I got to order.  \n\nFinding a place to sit was the biggest challenge.  The place fills up during lunch.  Luckily, hot dogs (and other similar items) are usually quick to eat, so people don't stay seated for very long.  The atmosphere doesn't pretend to be a place for \""hanging out\"" and talking anyway, so you want to eat and go.  \n\nThe people working there definitely have a good process, but you still have to wait a little while for your food, as everything's freshly made.  And with the menu and the list of toppings being so extensive, no two things coming out are probably alike.  \n\nI got my polish sausage and fries in good time, though, and enjoyed them immensely.  I just wish we had someplace like Matt's near MY workplace, as I'd like to try a lot more on the cheaply priced menu!"
"2","Dropped in for lunch on a Saturday.  Was relatively crowded, but I was able to order quickly with my food coming out a few minutes later.  \n\nI ordered the Chicago Dog all the way and a brat.  \n\nThe relish was bright green, so I was a little taken aback by it.  I gave it a shot, but it ultimately was not my taste, so it was banished to the serving container....  The remainder of the hot dog was really good though. \n\nThe brat - Nothing to write home about.  It was OK.  Not as good as a beer brat from home.  I would skip that one and just get 2 Chicago Dogs instead.\n\nIf you're looking for a hot dog in Chicago, Matt's is the place to get it!"
"2","Matt's Chicago Dogs are delish!  I love going there, parking is a pain, you can park in the lot at the greenway, but it is $4 for 30 mins or something crazy like that.  I drive past it and park in front of the Duke energy building at a meter and walk in for my fix.  The hot dogs are great, you can tell they take pride when they serve their food.  French fries are always hot and they have good sweet tea.  Now that is an extra bonus!!  I will rate Matt's Ch. Dogs, three corndogs."
"2","Love me a hot dog; especially Chicago dog. What makes a hot dog a true Chicago dog...well let me tell you. Steamed or water-simmered, kosher-style, all-beef frankfurter on a poppy seed bun. The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. NEVER, NEVER has ketchup. That's like putting ketchup on a Brat...absolute no, no :) \n\nMatt's, also located in Cornelius is great for a quick pit stop. They also have burgers, salads, Italian beef, etc. You can get everything \""Carolina style\"" too if you're so inclined. Located on The Green near Aquavina. Great outdoor seating on a nice day!"
"2","Chicago is only minutes away from uptown Charlotte.  Didn't you know that?  Well, Matt's Chicago hot dogs were as close to authentic as you are going to get in North Carolina.  \n\nChicago Dog Ingredients: Check \nRestaurant Ambiance: Excellent (Check)\nOutdoor Seating in a Park: Check\n\nGoing back for many more hotdogs:  CHECK!!\n\nThey also offer combos so you can wash down the dog with some delicious fries and a soda.  There are several other options besides the Chicago dog if you are feeling adventurous.  They also offer burgers etc etc.  I haven't tried the burgers yet and it may be a while because I'm going to keep getting the dogs.  I love hot dogs.  Enjoy!!\n\n-Ian M."
"2","Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp, fresh pickle and tomato. The poppyseed bun. The real Vienna beef dog... well, it was a bit soft but in general the food here to me says west 35th, 55th off the Dan Ryan, or even 95th and Ewing if you know what I mean. They've got the lingo. Fresh cut fries, pizza puffs. \nSadly the decor to me says something more like Fullerton and Clark. It's just a little too nice. I know that's a strange complaint. The tables and chairs look right, but that glass-and-brass sneezeguard and the tasteful mural... eh. Its just not tacky enough. I want to see posters of thick eyebrowed women holding up kronos gyros. \nI digress. Tasteful decor is not a dealbreaker though. I'm sure I'll be back."
"2","Mmm hmm it rivals red hot lovers of Ann Arbor, Michigan. I love a good chicago dog no matter where it came from and Matt knows how to make a good dog."
"2","Matt's is a great stop for lunch. I have been here many times and always had great fast service. Contrary to their name, they serve food other than hot dogs...actually I think the majority is something other than a hot dog. \nI have had the cheese burger which is good, better than fast food. The homemade chips with a side of ranch are amazing! \nI have other friends that have tried other items and love them. This is a must have stop in our lunch rotation.\nOn the healthier side, they have an apple blue cheese salad that is AWESOME. It has huge slices of apple, pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and romaine lettuce with a balsamic dressing. It is one of the best salads downtown!"
"2","I stopped at Matt's for a quick bite while attending a conference.  The location was perfect -- close to the convention center, yet not right in the middle of all of the hubub.  The park was pleasant to walk next to while heading over, but  I was glad to have someone with me who had been there before.\n\nWhile ordering, the staff was polite and friendly, noting our convention badges and asking where we were from.  They recognized the members of our group that had been there the previous day.  I ordered the two corn-dog combo; others in my group ordered the hot dog combo and the burger combo.  The fries were piping hot and perfectly seasoned.  Our corn-dogs were the perfect combination of golden batter and awesome dog, and the burger and regular dogs were gone before I could ask the others how they were :)  The ketchup on the table was a little low, but I think we were there just after the lunch rush, so that was understandable.\n\nBy the time I was ready for a refill on my diet coke before heading out, there was a small line at the register.  The cashier waved me to the front of the line when he saw my cup, so I didn't have to wait while others ordered -- I was highly surprised, and very thankful for his consideration.  I wish more restaurants did that.\n\nOne of the earlier reviewers mentioned confusion with picking up baskets right next to the utensil area -- when I visited, there was a young woman running food out (she called the number and waited for the correct person to raise their hands).  It seemed to work much better than having customers pick up their order.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Matt's Chicago Dog for anyone in the area."
"2","Normally I wouldn't even think about walking into a hot dog joint, then I reviewed the menu via yelp.  Much more than just hot dogs. Chicken, burgers, chix  salad, reubens, Italian beef and even BBQ pork. My brother and I were in town for work and needed to get out into the air. Short walk from our meeting, and Matt's is located on the first floor of what appears to be a newer condominium building. The entrance is adjacent to an outside green space area with multiple other shops and eateries nearby.  Fantastic seating outside and ample table space inside.  He went for the BBQ pork and I chose the Italian beef with cheese and hot peppers ( vs sweet). Au jus on the side, a basil based sauce that perfectly complemented the hoagie. Ladies, you'll need the knife and fork provided. Don't attempt to handle this one without 'em.  Well done, Matt!"
"2","My Hot Dog was good, but like many establishments these days the service was sub par. I walked up to the counter smiling ready to order, and the guy just stared at me like I was interrupting something that he had going on. I said Hi and he looked confused.....sooo before I placed my order I decided to give him some customer service 101......GREET!! I am amazed at the lack of individuals willing to at least do their jobs these days."
"2","I have actually gone to Matt's Chicago Dog for lunch for 4 consecutive weeks. Great place for lunch. They have really fast service seemingly even when there is a crowd. I have made it my business to try a few different things all of the items I've had were great. My only complaint would be on the homemade fries. Be sure to check your order because you do not want them cold. Definitely plan on going back."
"2","Two words.....PIZZA PUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Crispy fried pockets of pizza dough filled with the most mouth watering gooey cheese, bits of sausage and tangy tomato sauce inside. Sooooo good..... Do yourself a favor and get 2 of them and thank me after. I grew up in the Chicago area and everything here is just like I remember it. I just saw that they are now serving Chicago-style deep dish pizza! Can't wait to give it a try. They also have Vienna Beef hot dogs which are literally the best hot dogs you'll ever eat. I like to eat them with fries and cheese. Ask for extra crunchy fries because they tend to be soft, not crispy. Go here, you'll love it!"
"2","I tried their Italian Beef and its \""meh\"". Not really close to being what you can get in Chicago, but decent for what is offered in Charlotte. I don't even know if there is another place that offers Italian Beef on their menu, but I would still eat another one here if I was pheenin' for one. \n\nAnother Chicago fav is the pizza puff. Not much they need to do with it but fry it. Can't go wrong except for destroying any diet plans and giving you a tad of heartburn for us older folks. One was good enough for me...two might be pushing it. $3.99 each and no option to make it a combo meal.\n\nThe cheese used for the cheese fries is an absolute \""boooo!\"". I will not try those again."
"1","Don't know what the deal was, but on a day with a car show across the street and a basketball game a couple blocks away we were one of about 3 parties which rolled up for lunch only to find the place closed. Who knows how many folks did the same thing considering the posted Saturday hours. Then again about half of Uptown was closed. CLT remains at heart a town by, for, and of bankers. Sad."
"2","I like Matt's because they make most everything right to order so the burgers, fries, etc are always piping hot and fresh.  It takes a bit longer than not doing this way but the trade off is well worth it.  Love the Italian Beef, Char Dog and Fire Dog as well.\n\nThis location is really convenient to my office so I find myself there at least a couple times a month and will continue doing so as long as they remain consistent in what they do."
"1","Another Starbucks review? I've come to realize that not all Starbucks are the same and this one is somewhat lackluster. I ordered a medium iced Americano and overheard the baristas tell one another that it looked kinda weak.  They made it anyway and gave it to me.  I told them (politely of course) that it was and they made another one regular strength.  That's definitely not Starbucks signature customer service.  \n\nI can't say I will go back to this particular Starbucks, unless I'm stranded around J & W with a caffeine-deprived headache.  I agree with Jess that there are exceedingly few coffeehouses uptown."
"2","As the duly-designated Johnnie Cochran of this particular Starbucks at Gateway Village, it is my sworn duty to defend this location and say this to the 2-and 3-star reviewers: man, y'all don't know what you're talking 'bout.\n\nI've been working here for 3 years, and this one's been my go-to spot for caffeine. So I can't really complain about such trivialities as parking (parking sucks all around here, so while the complaints are valid, I couldn't care less) and the fact that it gets crowded and busy. More on that in a bit. But when you walk into a particular Starbucks and the baristas not only know what you favor every day - in my case, a grande Misto w/non-fat milk - but also have it ready before you reach the wait counter.\n\nThe great news about this location is the recent renovation, which sucked for me considering I was without a workday coffee fix for exactly 10 business days, and when you have to rely on that shitty-assed Keurig-brewed coffee I have to endure at home, or force yourself to walk from Gateway to N. Tryon on a spectacularly and stupidly hot afternoon, which, by the way, I'd rather suck on a wet and frayed towel than have to walk 6 city blocks in 95-degree weather just for a delicious cup of coffee...oh shit, where was I? The renovation, right. The biggest complaint was the lack of space at this location, and when folks were getting their fix between 8-10am and 2-4pm, you know this spot would get crazy crowded, and you really couldn't move around without accidently brushing someone's ass, and then have to wait for some slow poke to finish languidly stirring their mocha choca latta yay extra soy 5-pump coffee, it got pretty frustration. Thankfully, the renovation has not just created a better use of space - there's a nice and cozy sitting spot in the back - but it's even cheerful-looking, in a rustic sort of way. \n\nAnd then there's Sarah, the shift manager, a pint-sized, smart-ass (I love smart-asses) that runs a tight ship but makes everyone feel like they're the most important customer ever. The whole staff is great, friendly even, but Sarah is the shit.\n\nNot all Starbucks are created equal, but this location works just fine for me. So there."
"1","Hmmm..... where to start with this one. I'll go with atmosphere, which was the good part. Cool sports bar, pool tables and ample flat screens. Now for the not so good. Our bartender was a disaster- I rarely will ever say that, I used to be one myself and understand that sometimes you can get overwhelmed, or whatever other benefit of the doubt I normally give. But this was pretty bad. We sat at the bar with only a handful of other people, so it's not even like it was busy. We told her were were going to eat and needed menus. My finacee asked for a Sunset Wheat beer, which was on tap. We weren't paying attention to her as she poured, but once he sipped the beer he immediately knew it was a Sam Adams. OK, mistake. But when we looked over at the taps, the two were no where near each other. We flagged here down when she returned to the bar (she kept disappearing) and she apologized, went to pour the correct beer and only got a half a glass out of it. Just a minute, she promised. \n\nLiterally, like 15 minutes later, she finally came back but then ran off again before we could tell her we were ready to put in our food order. We were starving! We finally flagged here down and placed the order. Good thing we ordered when we did, because the food took forever to come out!! By the time we got it we were SO hungry. I ordered the Mahi Mahi over rice, and I wouldn't have finished it if I wasn't starving - the Mahi was really dry, and they added so much spice to the dish that whatever flavor was there was killed. Granted, it is a sports bar, but I've worked in Sports bars before that served amazing fish dishes. If it's not going to be good, it shouldn't be on the menu. After flagging the bartender down (again), we finally got our bill and decided that we definitely would not be back to eat, but maybe just for drinks."
"2","My girl and I rolled into Charlotte on a Monday at around 9. Living in New York gives one a certain confidence in finding places to dine at all hours of the night. Apparently that's not how this particular section of Charlotte gets down. We wandered around for about 20 minutes on the poorly lit, desolate streets until we found the Fox and Hound Smokehouse. \n\nNow Nature is all about balance. What Charlotte lacks in options, they make up for in value. Fox and Hound is a case in point. This is a sports bar with pool tables and lots of big screen TV's. \n\nWe got Budweisers for $2.50 and and Cosmos for $4. If I'm not mistaken, these are the prices Monday-Thursday! You don't see that in New York. Wings were 35 cents a piece, had a choice of 5 different marinades, and were quite good. \n\nGreat minds think alike. My girl and I both split some wings and got the Field of Greens salad. Greens, tomato wedges, Monterey Jack & Cheddar Cheese. Cucumbers, Roasted corn, peppers, onions and bacon pieces. I added blackened chicken to that sucker and it was crucial. The service was good and our waitress was very knowledgeable."
"1","My pasta tasted like rubber, I think they might have served me the display.  The crowd here was pretty rowdy and entertaining, but my dinner was no good.  I guess I don't enjoy mainstream bars like this one.  There are a lot of attractive people around, but I really didn't have a lot in common with the other patrons.  If you like kind of preppy establishments, you would enjoy this place..  It just isn't up my alley though.  I do have to say that it was clean and all of the employees know what they are doing though."
"2","There is a sandwich here that is delicious.  It's called the Black Forest.  Get it.  Life changing.\n\nI really like this place mostly because the Black Forest and the drink specials.  I usually have a good time here.  The other food isn't amazing, but the atmosphere is hopping."
"2","After stopping by Blackfinn for a drink on a late Friday night (what a huge mistake), we wanted a more laid back atmosphere and walked over here.  I've been to Fox and Hounds all over the country so I knew what to expect.  Had the French Dip which was loaded and very good.  This is always a pretty reliable place for decent pub grub and a beer.  But, avoid 'The Drifter' beer at all costs.. horrendous!"
"2","I really liked their beer selections.  This place is a nice hometown \""big\"" bar.  Not chain-like.  The staff wasnt the friendliest but the food, beer, and prices made up for that.  I would definitely suggest checking it out on a NFL SUnday too. Whole lot of TVs.  \n\nEnjoy\n\nIan M."
"1","Visited for lunch on the weekend. This place maybe good for game watching in the evenings but I do not think they are equipped for much else. \n\nI sat in a booth in the bar area and you could see they hadn't cleaned the walls in or near the booth in quite some time because of the old dried up food on the wall. Also the bathrooms where in bad shape.\n\nService: Slow and I'm not sure we where the servers to priority because there were not many other people in the place and we had to wait for everything.\n\nNot a good experience for us."
"1","I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. \n\nBoth had good beer selection, TVs, and space. \n\nBut the food - no. I got the fish sandwich at the Huntersville location - poor choice. I got the chicken sandwch at the Tryon location - looked like it belonged on the kids menu; and it took 30 minutes, so it was also dry. I initially thought I'd give the place a 2nd chance - 2 for 2 bad food experiences is enough."
"1","This place blows chunks.  I would have given it just one star but the waitresses are fab and cute.  The whole place smells like it has been through a flood and instead of getting the place cleaned properly they spent the insurance money on new cars.  \n\nI have had the wings here..blah and the veggies are gross with brown tips on the celery.  Yuck.  It is a huge space and has cool giant tvs so if I was just here to watch the game and drink it would be okey dokey.  There are a ton of places to watch the game though that have great food...sigh...."
"1","I really hate this place. I've given it 3 chances, and they all sucked. Food was awful. Everything fried. Clean? Fuggetaboutit!!!! Staff was overwhelmed, they tried, but to no avail. With all the superior choices within walking distance, I will never go here again.\nThis is the first, and probably only, negative review I have posted."
"1","Simply a bad experience. A group of us came to Charlotte from Cheyenne for a training course and wanted a good local place have dinner and drinks. The place wasn't busy at all and it took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get out drink order taken and get our beverages. The food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm. I assure you I will not return to this establishment on this trip or any future trips."
"1","This abomination certainly left much to be desired. There was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them, again to order food, and even longer to get our food.\n \nWhen it finally came, they had mixed up who ordered what, wrong sides with the entree, etc. All of our orders, from the 3 steaks to the sampler platter to the mini chili dogs, were lukewarm at best. One of the steaks even managed to taste like they had dropped it into the bottom of the grill. Think smokey, like campfire-smelling clothes smokey, but flavored that way.\n\nThe manager comped a portion of our meals, but the apparent lack of cusomer service and quality control more than overshadowed his attempt to make things right. I refuse to EVER set foot in this sub-par establishment again."
"1","Took for ever just to get water and to take our order. We were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold. Will not return."
"1","Groupon has allowed me to try new restaurants in places I never knew existed.I Have been to uptown many times and never noticed Fox and Hound. That could also be Rock Bottom Brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller. My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it...in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we  have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip. The one person who was polite happened to be the person who was in the next room cleaning. Kinda ironic since she doesn't assist the people actually dining. Will not be back."
"1","The atmosphere is like any other chain sports bar, service was bad, and I don't think I will be returning. Nothing stood out about this place with so many other great options just a block away."
"2","as a suscriber to the Blumenthal, there is always some great entertainment at this venue in its several concert/symphony halls. Highly recommend for dates and time with friends!"
"2","Having now been to a handful of shows here (most recently the touring version of Young Frankenstein), I am impressed with both the facility and the execution of service from all the house staff.  It makes an evening of arts and culture just that much nicer to enjoy.\n\nThe facility, adjacent and accessible from Founders Hall, is (relatively) new and sparkling throughout.  The lobby spaces are very open and offer a number of modern chairs and benches to provide seating to patrons.  A wide spiral staircase connects you to your level of seats and each level has a concession bar offering beer, wine, spirits, water, and a few snacks.  Prices are a little steep, but not so bad as at your typical movieplex.  Bonus tip: you can pre-order and pay for a drink during intermission.  When you walk out, there is a side table with your drink and order slip waiting for you.  So convenient and easy, as your time waiting in line is all but eliminated.\n\nI also think the seating inside the theater is very good, from most all levels.  If anything, the Orchestra seats may be close to the stage but require angling your neck up to see the action.  The seats in both the grand tier and mezzanine levels allow you to look down on the action but do offer unobstructed views.\n\nThe staff, located in the mint green jackets, are literally everywhere and available to help you find the most convenient door and path to your seats.  If you ever have a problem with patrons around you, a discreet word to an usher will quickly remedy the issue.  Bonus tip 2: they also sell parking passes for $5 before, during, and after the show.  There are 4 decks near the BPAC that accept the coupons.  The staff will check your parking ticket to make sure you parked in a qualifying deck and will then sell you a $5 ticket to get out after the show is over.  I can't say how helpful this is- you just feed the coupon into the gate and off you go- no digging for cash or waiting for a credit card receipt to slow you down.  \n\nBravo to this facility and their staff- they make a nice evening out just that much more enjoyable."
"2","Contrary to popular belief, \""The Blumenthal Performing Arts Center\"" was not a particular building, but a group of entertainment venues which included two theatres, the Belk and Booth in one building uptown.  Included in this group is also Ovens Auditorium and the new Knight Theatre, plus others. This caused so much confusion, that the enterprise recently dropped the name \""Center\"" from its name and is now known simply as \""Blumenthal Performing Arts\"" to avoid confusion.  It's a little hard to visualize Ovens and the Knight being in the same \""center\"" so this was a wise decision.\n\nAnyway, they do a great job bring quality entertainment to the QC.  They also often have good deals on prices, affinity groups, and more.  I have seen some major shows here, and almost all have been good.  This is coming from someone who has seen several shows in Toronto, which trails only NYC in theatre production in North America.  They seem to offer a little something for everyone throughout the year."
"2","Perhaps Blumenthal should not be reviewed, since it is a group of venues, and an organization, rather than a single location? Ah well, here we go anyway.\n\nAs Brian has mentioned, many have confused the Belk Theater for the Blumenthal, when actually, Blumenthal refers to the whole shebang - the organization that manages the Belk, as well as the Booth (in the same structure as the Belk), and a handful of others around town to boot - even some not uptown!\n\nWith that in mind, the most popular is surely the Belk because it is the largest and most prominent, but that does not make it the best. Some of the smaller venues are actually much better for seeing a show. The Booth may be one of the best places to see a show in town, and the McGlohon is a great space converted from a former church - it's tough to match anywhere.\n\nMake sure you check out the various spaces and recognize that the name Blumenthal means more than just the big theater uptown."
"2","Ri-Ra's is an Irish Pub and Restaurant that becomes a popular nightlife spot in Uptown Charlotte after dinner hours.  The food is good for the price level, and eating on the 2nd floor patio which looks onto the Hearst  plaza is a great experience during the warmer months.  At night Ri-Ra's has live music and a DJ which alternate floors depending on the night.  The bartenders are excellent, the atmosphere fun, and the drinks strong.  A great place to go to have a few drinks with drink specials every night of the week and a great place to grab a meal with specials depending on the time of day.  Cover for guys is $5 on the weekends, free for girls."
"2","I normally HATE chain Irish pubs, but this particular one is a cut way above the rest.  \n\nGreat food, very very nice staff, a perfectly poured pint of Guinness, and great (meaning talented and not obnoxious) Irish/Scottish entertainment."
"2","not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok..."
"2","Definitely a great Irish pub!  I was a little disappointed that the downstairs is completely all smoking tables since that seems to be where it is the liveliest but in all reality, it wasn't that smoky so we ended up eating downstairs anyway.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie which was veryyy good, definitely recommend it!  The decor is very authentic and could definitely see this place getting pretty crowded later on at night since the upstairs and downstairs are really not that big.  However, would recommend it as a place to check out if you are visiting Charlotte!"
"2","Great irish pub. Interior is great, looks like an authentic pub. They've got great food. Service is pretty good as well. Like most bars in Charlotte it's filled with smokers but that's par for the course in NC. Two levels, downstairs looks more the irish pub part. They typically have entertainment in some form either upstairs or down. Definitely worth a stop for a pint of Guinness!"
"1","Civilized, respectable locations don't charge separate covers for the gander and the goose.  Yes, it's that simple.  \n\nWell, Ri-Ra, I used to be a fan of your Irish authenticity, in terms of a cozy, low-key beer every now and then.  But seems you have taken a turn away from legitimacy, and towards masses of drunken revelrers.  A shame, really, for my once favorite bar in Charlotte."
"1","The food looks great so I'd definitely try it again for lunch or dinner.  But it's a tiny space, even with the upstairs, so don't go on weekends if you don't like being mauled to death by overly tan twenty somethings in polo shirts."
"1","Over-crowded, nothing special"
"2","When I walked into this place I felt like I was walking into my dad's favorite bar in my hometown.  It was very casual and laid back, with the big wooden chairs and comfortable atmosphere.  The food was about the same as the bar back home too.   Good but not spectacular.  It tasted very fresh and well cooked, but pub food is rarely worth getting too excited about.  The waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  She really wanted us to have a good time."
"2","We stopped in here for a drink on a Friday night.  One of the more authentic irish pubs i've been to.  The decor had a nice Irish feel and they had a band going at it upstairs(another example, they pronounce Smithwicks properly, if you don't understand, just ask an irishman)\n\nThey charged a $5 cover, ladies were free.  \nThe place was pretty hoppin, lots of drunk girls having a blast.\n\nWe pulled up to the bar and had a few drinks.  A nice selection at a decent price.  When it comes to Irish bars I'm always a sucker for a shot of Jameson with a Guinness chaser and they didn't disappoint.\n\nIt sounded like there was alot more fun to be had upstairs(live band, dance floor etc) but we were just to tired to check it out, maybe next time."
"2","This was the most pleasant dining experience I had on my business trip to Charlotte, and of course it occurred the afternoon I was leaving. After spending a week in suburbia hell, I wanted to see if Charlotte actually had a downtown, and happily I found it, along with affordable parking. We were super hungry, so we literally stepped into the first place that served food once we got out of the car. Luckily it was Ri Ra. I hear this is a rocking place on the weekend, but on a cold Tuesday afternoon, we pretty much had the place to ourselves (except for the loudmouth \""screenwriter\"" at the bar). We sat by the fireplace and enjoyed Harp on tap and sandwiches. My pastrami was delicious, but if I could do it again I would have the full serving of the magnificent mac n' cheese. The lunch menu was extensive with very reasonable prices. The best thing about this place however was our waiter, who is getting married in Jackson Square down here in NOLA this August, bless his heart. He was super nice and attentive with zero fakiness. Best of luck to you, kind sir!"
"1","a sports bar galore\ncold french fries make me so sad\neighteen dollars gone"
"2","I went to Ri Ra a few weeks ago and had a great experience. I called ahead to make sure they were serving fish and chips that day (they only serve it if the catch of the day is up to their standards) and they were. The beer selection is really great-- we decided to get the trio of Irish beers featuring Harp, Swithwicks, and Guinness.  We started out with a half order of wings with a Jameson honey glaze. The wings were perfectly cooked and the glaze was really excellent. My boyfriend and I both ordered the fish and chips which were fresh and delicious with a crisp and delicious crust. Even though we were incredibly full, we saw the table next to us order a dish full of what looked like chocolate mousse and immediately told our waitress we wanted that for dessert. It was a Bailey's chocolate mousse with whipped cream on the top. It was a HUGE serving, perfect for sharing and definitely fulfilled our chocolate craving. In addition to the food, the atmosphere was really cool and the service was fantastic. Our waitress had a lot of great suggestions and seemed very knowledgeable of the menu. \n\nI will be heading back to Ri Ra very soon to try some Guinness stew or a traditional Irish breakfast!"
"1","Went in to meet some friends who'd come in from out of town.  Lovely place, admittedly - the restoration after the fire is impressive.  When we arrived, the hostess, when she finally quit talking on her phone, couldn't find our reservation and seemed pretty snotty about it.  We went upstairs, found our people, and spent the next two hours trying to get the attention of the bartenders, to little avail.  The music was too loud for conversation.\n\nSummary: VERY noisy, terrible service.  I'd tell you about the food, but the food we ordered never arrived.  Wild dogs couldn't drag me back."
"1","Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say, they haven't gotten any more of my business"
"2","Here's a big hint: on Mondays, the burgers are half priced if you eat in!  They grind their meat in house so you can get them as rare as you like.  I strongly recommend getting the hand cut chips, they are light years better than the regular fries.  The burgers are huge, crumbly and messy, like a good hand made burger should be and they have a few different kinds, a friend had the lamb burger and said it was outstanding."
"2","Ri Ra is a pretty good size Irish pub in the First Ward downtown Charlotte. I stopped in for a quick solo lunch and was surprised to see so many free tables. If Ri Ra was near my office in Chicago, it would be packed at lunch time. \n\nThe hostess and server were both extremely nice. The hostess told me that all the wood and furnishings were brought over from Ireland when Ri Ra was built. It's a pretty big place, 2 floors, with a large bar and lots of tables. \n\nI was craving a burger but I had been told that I should have brisket while in Charlotte. Since I always do what I'm told, I went with the Wiltshire Patty, a delicious brisket sandwich. The brisket was very good, but the sweet potato tater tots were even better. Sweet potato tater tots. I'm now on a mission to find some of these in Chicago. \n\nFriendly service and sweet potato tater tots, what more can you ask for?"
"2","Hoegaarden on tap\nWhen you're in an Uptown mood\nRi Ra is the bomb"
"2","Went here during speed street for a drink with some friends so it was likely not a typical night, but we had a great time. The ambiance upstairs was great though the cover band was loud so we chose to sit outside. The balcony had a decent view and  it was a bit smoky but not too unbearable (and I'm the kind of guy who doesn't usually mind it).\n\nEveryone I saw seemed to be having a good time, which is always a great sign, and if I lived in Charlotte I'm pretty certain I'd be here regularly."
"2","Not cool enough to hang out at the pub, but grabbed a sandwich from the shop extension they got during lunch.  Abnormally high 4 stars from me, but today at lunch it was just amazing.  The weather was right, I was in a good mood and hungry.\n\nGot wheat roll, dijon mustard, salami, swiss, some vegetables and banana peppers.  All tasted great and it was unfair because I got my favorite meat and cheese with perfect other stuff in sandwich.  Little pricey came to a little over seven bones, but whatevs.\n\nLooking forward to washing my car, pumping some jams in the ride, getting a fresh haircut post-gym/tan/laundry. Maybe then I'll be cool enough for the pub.\n\ndmo out"
"2","The following things make Ri Ra amazing, no arguments. Period. End of discussion.\n\n1. McSorley's Dark, not only on draft but served in half pints as God intended.\n\n2. Colman's mustard available on request. She brought malt vinegar for my fries, sorry \""chips\"", without me having to ask. Together they are the end all, be all of chip eating.\n\n3. Super tasty and generous food. I loved the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.\n\n4. Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite scotch, so I say it gets a number.\n\n5. Friendly and jovial staff. We made an open table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.\n\n6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?\n\nRi Ra is a classy version of the Irish pub I love to feel at home in. Go check it out. It might just save your impression of Uptown."
"2","My friend had Sheppard's Pie and I had a great Burger with Onion Rings, Red Onion, Ri Ra BBQ Sauce and I threw away the bun fo fun and I'm on a diet, so I say.  First we had Potato Cakes and wow they were good.\n\nThis is a fun place!  It  exudes Charm and though I would not call it Romantic I do not know why I would not!  We were here last week and wanted to stay, though wound up at Vapiano, so all week I kept thinking when are we going back to Ri Ra, I only took a week.  Few places have such charm that I believe influence my enjoyment of the food.  Ri Ra seems to be one of those places!   Our server, a girl who lived in California was great!  They were staring to play trivia as we were finishing.  We were glad to be finishing! \n\nMore on food:  I always enjoy a few bites of a good Shepard's Pie though I would never want more than a few bites!  This one is the best I've tasted 4.0 yelp stars.  My burger  mmmmm 4.1 stars. Ri Ra BBQ Sauce 4.9 stars, Fries (someone loved them) 3.2 stars.  The Bread was a dark, thick, hearty, fresh wonder (looked like Chocolate Cake) 3.89 stars.  Onion Rings 3.2 stars.  Potato Cakes are hard to rate, I've had them in Brit Pubs, Irish Pubs and German Restaurants, these were very good, maybe 4.85 stars or better and they were served with sour cream and balsamic.  Nice Touch!\n\nFor dessert we had the very disappointing Special Irish or Baileys Chocolate Mousse and the slightly better Flour less Chocolate cake.  I'll rate the Cake 2.89 yelp stars, I had two bites and though neither of us liked it that much and my friend doesn't even like Chocolate someone cleaned the plate.  This Dessert was after the meal!\n\nI would go back and get the Leak Soup, though it was Soup of the Day and I would check out the Fried pickles and see what else might look good!"
"1","I was fairly unimpressed with my food at Ri Ra... I ordered the lamb burger, which consisted of an under seasoned, overly large portion of ground lamb with a bit of feta on a bun.\n\nRi Ra redeems itself a bit with a nice pub atmosphere. Although... a more unique selection of Irish brews would be a nice improvement."
"2","This review is geared specifically towards their lunch time fare.  I was looking for a new place to put into rotation and dropped in here a few weeks back.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it much to the liking of a Subway but refined and truly fresher ingredients.  The service was ok, not really over excited to serve but I imagine that's because this place gets really packed so they stick to the business at hand.  I got there around 11:30am and any later I would have been in line with about 20 other people.  This place gets packed!  Of course a couple other good things about this location is that if the weather is good there isn't a much better patio for eating then right there outside, out front of Hearst Tower.  Also they have a loyalty card which is always a good thing!"
"2","If you don't already know this, Irish Pubs are known equally as well for their booze (ales, whiskey, and lager!) as they are for their \""pub food.\"" I award 5 stars to Ri Ra for exemplifying the latter quality in its lunch menu. Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, positively, worth the trip. \n\nAlmost everdyday the lunch menu offers a \""special,\"" which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in (ouch!), nor do they get soggy when adding condoments. I'm not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh and soft, they're practically falling apart, until glued in place by the panini grill. Unlike other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun. The special pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as \""Christmas in a bun.\"" You decide.\n\nAND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean seriously, just when you thought life couldn't get any better, you get a pickle for the win. \n\nI'll definitely be filling out my loyalty card here (8 sandwiches, get one free). And you need to be beating the lunch rush, because once the special is out.... its OUT. Word has gotten out about the magic that happens at Ri Ra though, so don't get left behind :P\n\n5/5"
"2","Can't rate the food but we had an excellent time at Ri Ra!  Great service behind the bar on a busy Friday night! Thanks to all!"
"2","My fish and chips were really pretty good. I got the regular size and the piece of fish I got was enormous. I can only imagine how huge an actual large would be."
"1","OK, this current rating ONLY applies to the horrific braised short ribs that they unfortunately served me at dinner the other night! Usually, they have pretty solid food, and have a great beer selection. Went there with my work-mates in celebration of a major milestone, and our big boss picked up the tab (which is always nice)!\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers, lots of beer, and then the entrees. Mine was the last to come out, and when it did, I said, \""where's the beef?\"" And I literally meant it. My braised short ribs were ALL BONES! Yes, all bones, with VERY LITTLE meat on them! And what little meat there was, was chewy. As a \""foodie,\"" I am shocked that their Chef would actually serve something like that. I mean, did he think I was an Irish Wolfhound who would gnaw on the bones???\n\nI had to come home to eat something as I was still hungry (not having any meat for this meat-a-tarian is brutal)! I sent their Management a message, but have not yet heard back. I seriously doubt I will hear anything from them, but I felt compelled to tell them that this meal was just AWFUL! Thank GOD for the good beers to drown out my disgust.\n\nDespite my anger at this, RiRa still has the BEST Fish and Chips in Charlotte, and again, a wonderful beer selection. Just know that this one star rating ONLY applies to the beef short ribs dish, and nothing else."
"1","Been here twice; both times it was an awful experience. In both cases, the trouble started with the hostess, continued through poor/nonexistent service. On this occasion, there was a cover for the privilege of listening to a lousy cover band playing tired seventies tunes in a room with terrible acoustics--apparently without a soundboard--and putting down money on overpriced drinks, surrounded by frat boys, guidos, and gold diggers in addition to the aforementioned problems. I'd write a more entertaining review, but honestly it's not worth the effort."
"2","A Charlotte classic hang out :)"
"2","I went out for the evening with my cousin since the place that she had a Groupon for was completely slammed last night...  We hemmed, hawed and finally decided on Ri Ra... \n\nMy experience was solid...  Our bartender Michael was an absolute delight... He was attentive and offered suggestions...  Since I already had dinner for the night, I wasn't very hungry, but I was interested in trying something... I decided on the potato and leek soup, which was incredibly creamy and delicious...  For drinks, I had the Jameson Rose (which was a vibrant pink... I don't know why that surprised me as much as it did, but it was pretty cool... lol) and a beer flight for $6.  The beer flight was Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's and a mixture of Harp and Guiness called the Half and Half... I thought it was a great value with some quality beers.  \n\nMy cousin thoroughly enjoyed her nachos, but she sent back a cocktail... She apparently ordered a drink that no one ever asks for because Michael had to check the menu to remember how to make it... It didn't sound like it would taste great from the description and my cousin is ultra picky, so I don't fault him at all... lol\n\nOverall, I had a fabulous time at Ri Ra... I might have to start going out a bit more often..."
"1","I understand everyplace has its rules. My friends had a pre-wedding party here. And at 10pm it becomes a \"" standing bar\"" only. But did your staff have to be rude to the parents who were still sitting down a little respect goes a long way. We will not be going back."
"2","I came here for \""brunch\"" before having to board a flight home. \n\nI got the Holy Grail Ale and the Breakfast Burger. The ale was tasty and the burger was quite good.  Though I would warn anyone that if you're going to go for this burger make sure your stomach is empty, skip breakfast, go in starving.  This burger is the biggest thing I have ever eaten in one sitting! But, oh my, it was tasty. The kind of clog your arteries good. I don't think I needed to eat again that day. \n\nThe only complaint I had was that the service was a little slow for me given I had a flight to catch and mentioned it to my server."
"1","Apparently, reservations are not valued here.  We had a reservation for 7 and were told it would be a 20 min. wait.  Walked over to Harvest Moon Grille and had lunch instead.  Wish I could have reviewed the food..."
"1","The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made."
"1","I have always heard good things about Ri Ra's but my experience was nothing spectacular.  Ri Ra's is a decently sized (2 medium sized rooms) Irish bar is downtown Charlotte next door to Prohibition.  My group stopped in Ri Ra's to meet up with a few others and I was not impressed.  \n\nAfter paying one of the most unjustified $5 covers of my life, I walked in and felt like I had just stepped in to an Ivy League frat party.  Suits, sport coats, and even tuxedos everywhere but this bar was nothing to dress up for.  The general vibe in this place was very uppity and i had several unpleasant interactions with people.  \n\nA DJ (who was actually pretty good) was playing blaring house music.  I normally would have really enjoyed the music but the crowd at Ri Ra's on this night couldn't have cared less about the music.  Dancing almost seemed frowned upon based upon what I saw.  Not saying that a few bad eggs are representative of the entire bar but on this particular night, Ri Ra's did not live up to expectations."
"1","Went for lunch with a group of girls from work. Waitress was completely overwhelmed. She had too many tables and I didn't see a manager out helping her once. We ordered our food at 12:15 and asked where our food was 12:45. Didn't get our food until after 1. I had a meeting and told the waitress to nix my order. She came out with orders and dropped the tray as she was handing out food. 2 people didn't get their food and the other 4 had to get to go boxes. Food isn't good either. Changes need to be made. I have never had a good experience here."
"1","Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP, but these were a poor representation of them. Greasy and the batter was peeling off. I had the brisket with sweet potato, oh! That's right. I didn't get what I ordered. I over cooked greasy fries like everyone else. The brisket was very good thought. It had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it. The meat was a bit over cooked. It was a beautiful day to hand with friends on the sunny deck!"
"2","I went to RiRa for dinner on a Saturday night and it was surprisingly good. My husband and I sat at the long bar, while a fire roared behind us and the NFL playoffs were shown on the one television.  \n\nI rarely order burgers but was enticed by the Guinness BBQ Burger, figuring that it would be impossible not to pair well with my frothy pint of Guinness. I don't usually order burgers since they rarely meet my high expectations of a well seasoned, juicy, not-too-big-but-not-too-small beef patty, but RiRa delivered on all counts. I scarfed the burger, leaving little room for the good, but not great fries. My husband was very happy with his burger, which was some sort of super-spicy special and apparently left his mouth satisfyingly aflame. \n\nWe'll be back!"
"1","Stopped in after the theater for a pint, but could not get served. We sat down at one of the tables ( more or less stood by it because it needed cleaning) & waited for a server. One did walk by our table to grab the tip from the table behind us, then walked back by our table, but we were invisible. I then asked the bartender if we needed to place our order with her & take it back to the table, but she said servers were on the floor & they would take our order. So, we again waited & never did see a server. We gave up & went elsewhere for our nightcap."
"2","Granted time is of the essence, but the Staff at RiRa handled our group of 19 on a thirsty Thursday evening with ease!  Don't let uptown parking scare you away from crashing this party, with the Discovery Place parking deck just blocks away RiRa is very accessible for those not living Uptown."
"1","I love Irish Pubs and pub food, but the food at Ri Ra was bland and without taste. \n\nI ordered the Goat Cheese Fritters as a starter, and the Corned Beef and Cabbage as my main dish. The fritters were nothing more than goat cheese balls rolled in some sort of dry breadcrumb-like coating and then deep-fried, and topped with caramelized sweet onions. There was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste. \n\nCorned Beef and Cabbage is an Irish Pub staple, but Ri Ra has absolutely no clue how to prepare it. The corned beef was bland and somewhat tough, and despite the fact that they put some sort of cream sauce on it, it still had no flavor. The cabbage was both undercooked and without any hint of seasoning. Even adding salt and pepper did not help it. I did not eat the mashed potatoes that came with the dish, so I can't comment on them. \n\nRi Ra is a fairly nice looking place with a decent selection of beers on tap, and if you just go there for drinks, you should be fine. However, there are many places where you will get a much better meal, and I would definitely avoid the food at Ri Ra."
"2","One of my first experiences in uptown when I moved here...what a great Irish pub not to mention the food is out of this world...definitely recommend"
"1","I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast, and the price was reasonable for downtown.  The salad looks like it could be good, but there is no way for me to know because they were out of utensils.   How can a place that makes salads to go be out of utensils?  And the worst part is that you don't know it until you already through the line and have paid.  They should let people know before they pay.  The guy at the register made no apology or attempt to find some way to provide something to eat with.  Now sitting at my desk with a salad that I can't eat, gotta give it one star for the poor service."
"1","This happened a while ago (several months), but it still haunts me today.\n\nI ordered a portabello mushroom burger (I know, not really Irish, but don't judge). When my burger came out, it was not a portabello mushroom patty, but instead, a pile of sliced mushrooms on the bun. I asked the server, why it was not a portabello patty, and the server told me it was because they had run out of portabello patties, and this was what they were using instead. Interesting. I told him I didn't want this, and wanted something else. He obliged, took my plate of sliced mushrooms, and went to place my new order. I called the manager over, to let them know the situation. When I explained my side of the story, he rebutted with something \""Well the server told you we were out of portabello mushroom patties, and said you agreed to sliced mushrooms\"". WHAT?! I told him, no, that was incorrect, and that I was unware of them being out of portabello patties until I was brought a plate of sliced mushrooms on a bun; my wife agreed. The manager stood by his server. I firmly told him again, that I did not know/agree to having a sliced mushroom sandwich, and that the server conveyed no such message of running out of portabellow patties. I asked him how he could rectify the situation - free meal or something? No he would not, because I was aware of the situation (but I wasn't!), although he did comp me the original portabello mushroom burger...gee thanks.\n\nNow I'm not the type of guy who tries to find fault at every little thing to get a free meal. But come on. I would assume, after having worked in the restaurant industry for several years, that the manager, regardless of how much/little he believed the customer (me) would side w/ me, or at least try to rectify the sitatuion for future business. But no, instead, he stuck w/ his server, made an unhappy customer, and now I will not visit there on my own volition (my wife enjoys the place, so I will go back w/ her, only urging)."
"2","We visited this pub on our first trip to Charlotte. The Guinness Stew and Potato Cakes were very tasty. Our server was friendly and fast. Our beers were never empty before we had a refill. Great place!"
"1","(Only commenting on Ri Ra as a bar as I have not tried the food) Get some more staff! This place is terribly understaffed, on a Friday night there should not be only 2 bartenders for a packed bar. Easily takes 10 min to get a drink. I like the space and the patio but it means nothing if I can't get a drink."
"2","Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed. The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  as well. I liked it and the atmosphere of the bar."
"2","Just had an Angus beef blue cheese burger with onions mushrooms and cheese that was out of this world."
"2","Was visiting from Chicago and this place rivals any of the best Irish pubs out there. The ambiance is great, with the traditional wood paneling everywhere. Plenty of tvs for us to watch the games. We came in for a late brunch and it's was so delicious. My coffee came in it's own French press (which I will now buy for myself) and the breakfast sandwich had bangers, ham, cheese, bacon and egg on a toasted brioche bun. I made everyone at the table try it! If I ever happen to be in Charlotte again, I won't move from that bar. Haha better than epicenter!"
"1","This review is of their Ri Ra Sandwhich shop around the corner since there is no separate listing for this shop. Stopped here because I've never been before, so I ordered the old faithful Reuben. Pretty hard to screw up, right? Well they managed to serve me a sandwhich that was barely eatable as the corned beef in it was like leather....very hard and chewy. The sandwhich was small. For $9 I'd expect a LOT more. The Rose Sauce wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Not a very good sandwhich.\n\nService was iffy at best. The young lady behind the counter was very nice and personable, but the other two seemed like they didn't want to be there...aloof is the appropriate term.\n\nThe ONLY saving grace were the Keogh's Dubliner Irish Cheese and Onion Potato Crisps imported from Ireland. If this place is going to rely on packaged potato chips to save them they won't be in business long.\n\nSo a SMALL sandwhich, chips and a 20oz bottle of diet coke set me back $14 with tip. That is a LOT for a LESS than adequate sandwhich. I will not be coming back.\n\nNOT recommended!"
"1","Just average unfortunately.  The good:  My drink...dark and stormy is going to be my new standby.  The mediocre:  Everything else.\n\nBurger was just so so as were the fries.  The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce, but that couldn't save it.  When asked how our food was I was honest and could tell the waiter was taken aback. I mean seriously, don't ask me if you don't wanna know.  I was polite about it, but said that the dessert was just average.  And questioned why it was cold.  Bread pudding is always warm no?  He also got docked a few points for twice trying to take my plate while I still had more then half of my food left.  He actually removed my girlfriend's drink while she was still working on it!  \n\nIt was nice to have a late night eating option in uptown, but unless someone else wants to go I won't be back."
"1","Lights too low, music too loud, not many people inside, drinks too expensive. Plus it costs 5$ just to get in. Def not worth it. Try some where else!"
"1","Went here for a corporate dinner. Had the finger sandwiches (chicken, pulled pork, and something else), chips and spinach dip, lobster cakes, and potato cakes. \n\nOnly tried the pulled pork, which was good, but others said the chicken sandwich disappointed. Lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo.\n\nSpinach dip the only saving grace. Oh, and their lemon bar dessert."
"2","Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime, relaxed at night, always comfortable. A pleasure!"
"2","Tasty appetizers and dishes. Pungent sauces. Quick delivery. Excellent choice for Chinese food in Charlotte."
"2","Great food, beautiful environment. Not super authentic but as far as Americanized Chinese food goes this place was super good. Also lots of veggie options and sizable quantities."
"2","I'd say this is one of the more consistent lunch places in uptown. I usually get the dynasty noodles with a side hot sauce and the food always comes out pretty quickly. I guess they've got to keep the food moving since there's always a crowd during lunch hour. I wouldn't say that it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it definitely is one of the best Chinese places in Charlotte."
"1","I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre, I have had WAY better and I can't say that anything I had was really that great. I'll be looking for a different chinese place to eat at."
"1","I have had Chinese food in a bunch of different cities, including NYC and San Francisco to name a few. So far I have not found a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. If you go to Soho for pick up don't follow their address to the T because it is actually on the other side of the building next to Fuel Pizza. Call ahead when you are about 5 minutes away and they will come outside to deliver your food. As far as the food goes, the dumplings are a little too doughy but the sauce is quite good. I would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland. I am not going to X this place out just yet I may give it another shot. Still looking for a good Chinese Food place here in Charlotte wish me luck!"
"2","Me, the fine newcomer Elizabeth A. and Heather X., went here on a rainy Friday at 330pm and I left wanting to come back the next day.\n\nThey still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me sleep in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring it in with you!\n\nA smaller place than I expected, there's a great, mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully warm with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty when we arrived, I can definitely see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty good option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!\n\nStarting off with crab ragoons and asian fresh rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh rolls were good, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with (reminded me of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well with it either.\n\nI ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was true that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From the fry (not overly but not soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, and they delivered!), to the picking of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out not mushy, not stiff but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not in most - no clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).\n\nThe service was attentive, kind and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy!"
"2","This is some of the best Chinese delivery I've ever had, and I've gotten delivery in Soho, NYC before! A bit pricey for delivery, but after you have a bite you'll know why. Scrumptious! Quick delivery too!"
"1","It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown, and Soho Bistro continues to prove me right.\n\nI have been here two or three times now, and I tend to order the more \""authentic,\"" or less popular items such as the beef noodle soup, Japanese ramen, and they have both let me down.\n\nAlso, whenever I come here for dinner I am literally the only customer in the dining area. I think that Soho Bistro must really be only a lunch place."
"2","Awesome! Went for dinner last night with a group of four.  Two chicken dishes, two shrimp dishes: Sesame shrimp, Szechuan shrimp, Honey Lemon Chicken, Tangerine Chicken.  The flavors were amazing, but I hate eating dark meat.  I'm deducting a star for that.  We had a great little server and we couldn't have been happier!!! We will be back for sure."
"2","First pointer: Although the address says N. Tryon, the entrance to this place is on College St (back side of Hearst Tower) so you can decide where to park. We parked at Church and 5th thinking it was just around the corner but then had to walk two blocks which wasn't a pleasant walk on our way back from dinner when it got chilly and rainy.\n\nAmbiance: Intimate. Soft lighting and pleasant music. We went at a time when the restaurant wasn't crowded. Only 4 tables were occupied, but I believe this place must be packed for lunch.\n\nService was courteous and our food arrived in reasonable time. Our server kept our glasses full.\n\nWe ordered the Summer Roll and Hot and Sour Soup. The Summer Rolls were as good as any others (they all taste the same) but the veggies were fresh. The Hot and Sour soup was good (we split it). For the entree we had the Mongolian chicken, which was mind blowing. It had just the right amount of spice, hot enough to open up my blocked sinuses, but not overly spicy. The flavors perfectly melded. The portions were large enough. Me and my boyfriend left the place with full tummies and some leftover Mongolian chicken."
"1","We had lunch here during a rather unbusy Saturday.  Most places in this area seem to only serve dinner on Saturday so this was one the few seemingly vegan-friendly Saturday lunch spots.\n\nSad to say, my entree was a little bland. It was a tofu, vegetables, and wide rice noodles entree.  It surely looked spectacular with the varied vibrant colors and large portion size, but it failed to delivery on tastiness!  No bother, I drowned the sucker in chile sauce and soy sauce until it was more edible. The tofu spring rolls appetizer suffered from a similar tastelessness.  \n\nAt least service was prompt and everything was salvageable with a little doctoring up.  I suspect that the omnivore dishes may be more palatable as my companion didn't seem bothered, but she is polite gal, so who knows!  The large portion size did permit me to chow down again later, which is always appreciated when I am about to possibly spend all night throwing back drinks, with little or no vegan options immediately available.  \n\nI don't know, I'm willing to gander Soho Bistro is probably not too bad for most diners, but it just didn't do it for me!"
"1","Food is decent, but service is no good. I was here before a couple of years and did not want to go back because of the service. Unfortunately, went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service. I know I won't make the same mistake again!"
"2","The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!"
"1","This is located in the heart of downtown. Food is average and service is not bad. Will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 PM. But take out is very fast. \n\nI have been going here for past 7 years and one thing that sucks big time is the two Cantonese women who manages this place.  They have no idea what is a good service in a restaurant means. They are rude. Literally rude. Half the time you don't understand what they speak in English. No in this restaurant are polite. They serve food as if they are serving people in homeless place. And they never treat you as patrons by the way. \n\nAm I eating and dining there ? \""No\"". I am try taking out? \""Yes\""\n\nLocation : 4/5\nAmbience: 3/5\nService: 2/5\nFood: 2.5/5"
"2","Excellent food and excellent service. Wait staff is always very attentive, constantly refilling drinks, etc. Lunch rush does make for a bit of a wait, but there are only so many tables. Highly recommended."
"1","We stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for a trip and happened to visit Soho Bistro for dinner on a rainy evening. The restaurant is clean, well laid out and appealing. The staff was exceptionally friendly and our waiter was a young man who was very eager to please. Unfortunately, the food was sub-par. The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty, but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error, but when the chicken was served, it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other. My dinner companion ordered noodles which he described as tasting like watered down spaghetti with weak curry sauce. I can't stress how nice the people were, but the food portion could use a visit from Kitchen Nightmares."
"1","I've been going to this place for a few years now, and every time I go it loses another star and another chance. It used to be the best place to get Chinese food but recently it has gotten really gross. Today was the last straw. I got the Steamed Chicken Dumplings and a order of Edamame to go. The dumplings had no taste other than salt,  the dough was so think and chewy I didn't eat my last two. The worst part were the soy beans. Half of them rotten, no salt, no seasonings, just plan nasty and I tossed about half of the order. Come on guys I know you can do better!"
"2","I last reviewed Soho Bistro in mid-2011, and last night my young daughter and I popped in there for dinner before a show.  I thought I'd provide an updated review!\n\nThe place is still awesome.  The atmosphere is still peaceful and quiet, and the wait staff efficient and polite.\n\nWe ordered four items off the menu: scallion pancakes, crab wontons, tangerine chicken and sesame shrimp.  The scallion pancakes were just as good as they ever were.  The crab wontons were a bit disappointing - we were expecting something closer to crab Rangoon (based on the description) but these are more grainy than creamy.  The filling almost looked like cous cous or quinoa.  Despite this, we ate all but two of them, so they were still good.\n\nMy tangerine chicken was OUTSTANDING.  From first bite to last, it was delicious and is my new favorite thing.  My daughter's sesame shrimp was also delicious (she let me have a bite) although she thought it was a little too sweet.\n\nStaff was quick to refill drinks throughout the meal, and our total bill for dinner was $38 - a relative bargain considering we had two appetizers, two entrees and multiple refills on my daughter's soda.  \n\nI continue to recommend this place for good Chinese food at a great price.  Can't wait until my next event uptown so that I can dine here again!"
"1","Have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on? Enough said. If I must give you more reason why you can skip this place, the food is completely commercialized and forgettable, and the there is not a whole lot going on here. You are far better off at Stool Pigeons or even Cans."
"1","Can you say, \""Ug?\"" So, there are lots of TVs and there was the same game on, for all 40 sets. This seemed quite bizarre. Also, why have 4 screens when you can have one huge one? Why advertise fresh squeezed lemonade, when it's from a package? Why give french fries with most of them burned? Why not have a vegetarian burger in addition to all the artery clogging ones? The reason for the one star, was that our waitress was cool and very courteous."
"1","Lack of Atmosphere (Even during sporting events)\n\nFood is terrible.\n\nBartender/Waitress were incredibly rude....\n\nEverybody has bad days, they should not be this bad....."
"1","So, I don't know WHY we decided to stop into this sports bar for some lunch during our Charlotte trip, oh wait, yes I do remember. It's because we were starving to death and sick of walking in the 100 degree weather. \n\nAnyway, I still regret stopping in as I'm sure there are a million better places in the area to go. The service was terrible, granted we think the guy may have been new, but it was overall awkward and just odd. I don't really want a side of 'uncomfortable' with my mushroom swiss burger. (I also don't want to be asked what kind of cheese I want on my mushroom SWISS burger). \n\nPricing was a little high, food was decent, service was pretty bad but more than anything I'm just mad at myself that I didn't do a bit more research. Definitely should have found a local lunch gem that would have satisfied my appetite and need for a great cultural experience. There's always next time."
"1","Found a long black hair in my burger. The buns were cold the meat patty was overcooked (asked for medium) and very thin. The side salad was decent, the tea tasted like crap and the food took foreeeeever to come. The waitress shifted from friendly to rude and then back I was thinking about asking her if she had a evil twin sister or something."
"1","Oy.  Why do I do this to myself.\n\nThe service was fine, but nothing about the food was edible.  First of all, five dollars for stale tortilla chips and \""homemade\"" salsa (clearly from a can).\n\nThe chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber.  \n\nIt's my fault, I guess."
"1","Shame on me for not consulting Yelp prior to going here but I was uptown with my 6 y/o and she was in charge of finding somewhere to eat and chose this spot.  \n\nThe service was fine, place was empty because it was early so if the service had been bad I would have been even less impressed.\n\nThe kids menu was quite pathetic AND expensive!  $6.00 for two small hamburgers? And when I say small I'm talking like half dollar size burgers...thus the reason we followed up dinner at TCBY (silver lining :)!)\n\nI had the Thai beef salad and it had about 6 strips of beef.  Definition of strip = about 3 inches long and 1/4 inch wide...again pathetic.  Flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else.\n\nMy advice....avoid it and keep it movin!"
"1","I don't know who of my group picked this place out, but they never owned up to it. \n\nThe service was absolutely terrible.  The waitress was practically all but ignoring us.  We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverware/napkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  \n\nAs for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoy/appreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwich/burger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \""veggie\"" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedges/chips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \""yeah, it should come with it\"" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \""offered\"" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. \n\nYes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.\n\nThe kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \""Charlotte's Finest\"" ... Methinks not."
"1","I only gave them 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. Food was mediocre (fries were cold), and we haven't seen our waitress in 45 minutes (writing this review while waiting to ask for the check). I'll write another review tomorrow if I'm still here waiting."
"1","Slow service I can handle (took about 20 mintues to get two glasses of water) and we were there over an hour and a half (during a slow time) to get two cheesesteaks.  \n\nAverage food, expected, just looking for something quick and close.  \n\nThe icing on the cake was when the waitress lost my credit card.  Now I realize this could easily happen, however she didn't bother to tell me that she lost it.  Finally after her being gone 20 minutes with my card, we found her and asked her what the delay was, to which she responded \""did I by chance give you back your credit card?\""  My first thought was TELL ME RIGHT AWAY SO I CAN CALL THE BANK!!!!!!!  I told her that and her response was \""I know, but I was so embarrassed.\""  Luckily, they found our card eventually, but if someone else had found it, they could do a lot of damage in 20 minutes with all the shops around there.\n\nAs a side note, during our LONG HORRIBLE experience, two other groups came in and left after about 20 minutes of not even having a waiter/waitress say boo to them.  I wish we had seen their experiences before we ordered.\n\nI wish 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it!"
"1","We were staying at the hotel it's located in (The Marriott) and we couldn't go anywhere because it was raining. Horrible experience.\n\nFirst we got in and had to search for a table. Once we found one (which was dirty) we waited about 10 minutes for the server to clean it. Once we finally sat, she took our drink orders and came back soon after for our dinner orders. I asked which was her favorite from the sandwhiches and she said the philly. LIAR!\n\nBesides the fact that it took 45 MIN, yes 45 for us to get out food, when the food got there it was all really shitty. The meat inside my philly was burnt to a crisp along with the cheese which was so burnt, parts of it were black. The bread was cold and hard. Fries were ok. By this point, we were so hungry, we just ate. After we were sitting with our plates in front of us for about 20 min, I decided to get up and go get the checks myself. She gave them to me and I walked them to my table myself, took the credit cards myself and gave them to her. We had to go, it was getting way too late.\n\nGranted, it was St. Patricks day and the place was packed, but when that happens, you need to ask for help."
"1","This is a sports bar off the lobby of the Marriott Center City in Charlotte, NC. This is not a big place, but laid out to be a sports bar with a lot of monitors. Went here a night during final four (Basket Ball). The bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive. They have a good selection of beer (however their dispenser of draft was out of service). How can you have a bar with no draft beer? I got a Sam Adams (in a bottle). Tried their Philly Cheese Steak. That is probably the worst Philly cheese steak I have had in my life (and I used to live in Philadelphia). The meat was burnt, the onions were fried beyond belief and the cheese was very greasy. The fries were OK. \n\nIn summary a great location, great server, beer so-so and food not up to par.  Sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook."
"1","As for a place to spend money uptown I'd skip it.  The bar is ok, the food is ok, it's nothing special. It's a convenience sort of thing, I'd imagine if I was in from out of town and looking for something quick to eat, a place to shoot the bull, and I was staying upstairs in the Marriott I would be ok with it.  The only reason I give it a measly 2 stars is because there are better options all around, this sort of competition should have been motivation to update the menu and decor. \n\nMy best experience here:  We used it for a Sunday brunch my family put on during our wedding weekend.  For that experience the food was great, the service was excellent, but that is not their \""normal\"" operation.  \n\nI guess if it's raining out and you are stuck and have no place to go I'd check it out. But under any other circumstances you'd probably get a better meal by walking a half block in any direction."
"2","When I first moved here in 1995 this and Ri Ra was the only 2 places downtown. I said to myself, why the hell the I move here.  Charlotte has grown.  This place is a regular guy beer and wing joint.  It is affordable, not stuffy and you can kick back and be yourself.  The prices are reasonable.  Darryhl is a nice lady and a great barttender"
"1","A friend from Chapel Hill came to visit us yesterday and we decided to take him to downtown Charlotte. Since most locations were closed, we decided to stop at Champions, it was either that or Hooters. The environment seemed so uninviting, I was the only female in the room, but its a sports bar so whatever. We all ordered food from their ridiculously priced menu. Food quality, meh. I ordered the BLT which was about $10. When my food came out, the chicken was cold. It tasted like it was refrigerated from days ago. The only thing I liked was their ranch sauce. The bar was noisy for only a few guys being there and there were TV's everywhere! It was kind of uncomfortable."
"1","Went in for a couple drinks and food. It was so slow that I actually asked one of the employees if they were closing. With that being said, drinks came out pretty fast but that was it... waited about 15 minutes for the bartender to take our order which we cashed out and moved on to another place to eat. There were more employees in the restaurant than guests, and ironically there were a couple of them enjoying a meal, at a table in the Dining room, in front of customers who couldn't even order an appetizer in a reasonable time. No management present that we could see. Seems like a place that has given up."
"2","Everytime I travel to Charlotte and stay at the Marriott City Center I visit Champions. Consistency builds trust. Trust is how a business thrives. The cheese fries are a must but add jalape\u00f1os and get an ice cold draft; some great selections are available. \nThe service is always so friendly and outgoing!!\nLove all the options to catch the latest in sports entertainment!"
"2","Great food, friendly attentive staff.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came for lunch around 11:30am.  There were only a few people in the restaurant; however, the bartender was very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Grilled chicken BLT and it was very tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the Thai Beef Salad and I tried the beef and it was amazing.  He said the salad was great!\n\nSince we were staying at The Marriott, we came back around 11pm after seeing a movie and the bar was full.  The bartenders were friendly.  I had the Peach Margarita which was delicious but was a little heavy on the peach.  My boyfriend had the Triple C Rail Pale Ale.  It's a decent local beer."
"2","The Marriott City Center has a great location close to everything. The rooms have been recently renovated and the restaurants and bars in the hotel do a nice job. \n\nThe rooms are \""Marriott practical\"" meaning that all the things that you need to have a successful trip whether business or pleasure are there. Nice work area with plenty of outlets, but they still charge for an Internet connection ($12.95 per day), sweet bed linens (if you like them alot, you can purchase them through a catalog in the room) and a bathroom stocked with Bath and Body works products. There is a HD flat screen TV in the room and a dock for your iPod but missing was a mini-bar which I thought was a standard in Marriott rooms. Oh well. . . . .no Pringles and beer for me! \n\nBut what pushed this to a 4 star review for me was the high level of service that I got during my stay. From the moment that I checked in I was taken care of. My room reservation and keys were ready to go when I got there. They lent me an umbrella to stave off the snowstorm that was raging outside. I was greeted at every turn by management and staff alike and room service even ran back downstairs to get me a straw when my Bloody Mary came without one. Every one was courteous and polite. \n\nIn the small points department, know before you go that the walls between the rooms in this hotel are not that thick. Trust me- I spent the night in the room next to the couple who was celebrating Valentines Day over and over and over again. Instead of \""getting a room\"", maybe they should have \""stayed at home\"". Yikes! Even the TV couldn't drown out their \""delight\"" in having a king sized bed. Let's just say it sounded like they got their money's worth. \n\nThat aside-Marriott's are a good choice for their consistency across all variables. I'll stay here again the next time I'm in the \""Queen City\""."
"2","When it comes to checking in to a hotel, I'm all about fast efficient service. Charlotte's Marriott City Center could be a role model for other hotel establishments. Valet parking, for instance. While many people prefer to self park, there are those of us who would rather not schlep our belongings across a dark parking ramp after a few hours worth of travel. I can appreciate the simplicity of someone waiting for you to open your front door, assist with your heavy luggage, and hand you a valet ticket, smiling throughout the entire exchange. \n\nImmediate recognition as you approach the front desk is key to happy patrons. I grit my teeth when I am left standing for a few minutes while staff members \""pretend\"" not to see you while finishing up their previous business. A simple acknowledgement is always appreciated in such situations, but it amazes me how many times the front desk staff resorts to momentary ignorance. Not here though. Big smiles, and a fast, efficient exchange of information. After a quick run down of restaurant times, hotel updates and the fitness room location, I was on my way to my room. \n\nMarriott does well with creating a comfortable home away from home: comfy desk chair, ample desk space with plenty of outlets, and my personal favorite, the ipod docking station. There is something so nice about listening to your favorite play list while working away on your laptop. Bummed that wifi is not free (especially when my wireless card is having issues). If Panera Bread offers free wifi, I think a full service Marriott should too. \n\nGreat location in the heart of downtown Charlotte, the City Center will be my first choice."
"2","Marriott City Center is the host with the most! Beside the Westin this hotel has all the happenings. This is by far one of the best Marriotts that I have ever stayed in based on comfort, entertainment, location, and amenities. \n\nStarbucks check, by now those of you who read my reviews should know that SB is a symbol of civilization that comforts me when I am away from home. Friends know old lady Toya will be getting a basic tall coffee to kickstart a day of activities. This one is complete with Charlotte souvenirs, pickled jams, and veggies from local farmers-nice idea. \n\nThe gym was clean and all the equipment was new. I'm talking about USB ports in the elliptical machine new! I worked out 2 days in row and the 2nd day I got into the whirlpool, which was big enough for about 10 people. Pool great for laps, lemon water, lockers, fresh towels neatly stacked, attendants on hand. Nice workout area. \n\nThe Cutter's Cigar bar which I talk about in a separate review and Champions Sports bar with lots of TVs and good lookin men standing around in grape clusters. Too bad you can't pluck one when while you with one. (Just jokin)\n\nThe hotel breakfast was very good, complete with brunch buffet or seperate selections. All the usual stuff belgain waffles, omlette stations, hot cereals, breakfast meats, All for a very affordable price about $10-15.\n\nThe rooms were comfortable, the first time my bed ever had too many pillows. All your electronic docking stations available, a nice view of the city, large sink, huge chrome shower head that could rinse a small elephant (luv those), but oddly enough no fridge.\n\nThrough out the weekend the hotel gave little hospitality gatherings, its rumored they had free drinks. This is a great place to stay, getaways to hotels like this keep me sane."
"2","I'm really starting to rack up those Marriott points now.  I can't even remember all the Marriott's I've stayed at, but I do remember all the good ones.  This one is definitely in the top 10.  The location couldn't be better, and although the building seems a little old, the rooms were typical of the more modern Marriotts.  What put this one over the top was the Concierge Lounge on the 18th floor.  Most lounges are simple, bare-bones and offer only just enough.  The lady who ran this did a wonderful job of keeping things stocked and clean.  She even made a pretty good smoothie (healthy too) and offered plenty of fruit for breakfast.  They even had San Pellegrino.  Too bad Kristin wasn't there to take it all.\n\n4 stars for the best Concierge Lounge of all the Marriotts I've been.  The rest of the hotel is basic and room service did an adequate job.  The normal rate (over $200) is a little price, but the location is very central.\n\nValet = $18, self-park = $12"
"2","I stayed here for a corporate holiday party that was held in their large ballroom and really enjoyed myself. The rooms were satisfactory and the suites were great for post-party gathering. The event itself was beautiful and the food was really great. I really liked the event space layout and the staff was phenomenal. Best of all, the hotel is so centrally located that we were able to walk to all the places we needed to go the next morning. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Charlotte."
"1","This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are good enough. The staff is friendly and there is a fantastic restaurant located in the lobby. So, why only 2 stars you ask? I'm traveling on business, like many people who come to this town, and I cannot come close to expressing my frustration with the wireless internet. ...........................\n\nLet me take a moment to calm myself.\n\n\nIt's horrible. Paying per device seems silly when it's not uncommon for people to have a few devices, but that's not my biggest issue. My complaint is that I'm having to refresh my wireless connection every 3 minutes on my iPad. It's absolutely maddening. I wouldn't be as concerned if I were here for pleasure. The ability to work from my room is pretty critical when traveling on business. I've never had connection issues on my device, so I'm confident it's not the problem. Over the past two nights, I have spent more time waiting on/refreshing my connection than actual productive time online."
"2","Really nice hotel close to everything in the uptown area. Most importantly it's away from the noise in the evening.Walk one block to all of the bars on the ave or Epic center. Epic Center area is really loud at night which makes this hotel ideal since its one block away from the noise"
"1","First, my disclaimers...  I have a pretty negative stance on tobaco smoke; especially cigars. I'm here on business from Oregon and not only don't smoke cigars, but it wouldn't dawn on me that a hotel would support a cigar bar.  But then, this is the South, and we're in tobacco country (sadly).  I'm a public health professional, and am pretty mortified that the National Association of Public Health Institutes would choose to hold a conference in a hotel that not only had a cigar bar, but reeked of stale cigar smoke.  But, to give them the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure they never thought to ask.\n\nSo, you get where this is going, right?  Walking into the hotel, it smelled stale.  They sent me to a room (on the 8th floor) that smelled totally moldy - I kept wondering if they had been involved in a flood - did Hurricane Sandy hit here?  I thought another room might help.  The second room they sent me to was either occupied, or someone had decided to have their dinner there.  I asked for a third.\n\nRoom three doesn't smell much better.  Again, stale and moldy.  But I finally got it - it's the entire hotel.  The elevators reek from old cigar smoke, and the entire building is permiated by this acrid odor.  I can't wait to hear what the public health people have to say about this tomorrow.  Meanwhile, I have to tolerate being in this building for the next two days.  And I already have a headache.  The things I put up with for my job..."
"1","What's that smell?\nNot sure if it is me but the rooms in that hotel have a weird smell very noticeable when I show up on Sundays. Some kind of wet used socks flavor ... I guess I get used to it and get less affected the rest of the week. \nBesides that, nothing really fancy or weird about that hotel ... just another full service Marriott. The breakfast for those with lounge access is pretty good though and the attendant is really nice! I like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday.\nA big thank to the night shift for going the extra mile and moving us to a conference room and providing refreshments after seeing us struggling in the lobby at 2AM trying to complete a deliverable while they were cleaning up."
"2","I recently stayed here because the conference I was attending was held here. In terms of accommodations -- this place was very nice! The rooms were spotless and the housekeeping service was just great. I have to say, the staff really went out of their way to make sure everything was smooth, from check-in to check-out. (They even have a luggage service, attended by helpful staff.)\n\nThe hotel was in a great part of town too -- it was within walking distance of Epicentre which has a lot of restaurants.\n\nIf I were in the area again, I'd definitely consider staying here again."
"2","Three friends & I [all in our twenties] stayed in a hotel room here overnight. The decor is beautiful, and the service was quick and easy. The concierge gave us free covers into the local bars at the epicentre so be sure to ask. The room was beautiful, the beds were comfortable, and it was a great price to stay downtown. It was a great hotel experience!"
"1","I had such high hopes! The person who greeted me was wonderful and took care of my large bag and car. But my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak. In the hall there are mops and vacuums. Not a good sign. Is it tomorrow yet when I get to check out? This place is not worth the price!"
"2","This Marriott is in a great location if you have business in downtown Charlotte and they have done a good job of keeping it up to date and providing value for the money. Parking is not the greatest, but this is downtown in a major city."
"1","Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant."
"2","Charlotte Marriott city center is a nice hotel located in the perfect part of downtown. They have a decent sports bar and a good restaurant with reasonable \""hotel restaurant\"" prices.\n\nMany decent clubs and high-end restaurants are within walking distance.\n\nThe rooms are comfortable with a large desk for working. +lots of plugs\n\nShower is hot, a good thing, and towels are soft and fresh. (I only mention this because some hotels have a strange chemical smell on their towels after being washed)\n\nFriendly, southern staff"
"2","Very comfortable hotel. The front desk staff is always so nice. I have hosted several meetings here and the complete experience has always been favorable. From in-room dining to restaurant options you will not go hungry. \nWalking distance to many great places through out downtown Charlotte. \nI always sleep like a a baby."
"1","I booked this hotel for the 2014 ACC Championship game. I thought that this hotel, as a host hotel for the game, would offer options for dinner after the game. Wow, I was wrong. We got back around midnight to a line st the only open restaurant where we heard last call was most likely before we could sit down. We decided to try room service... What a mistake. I called the front desk and was told they stopped room service at 11. Wow, 11 closure on a night when they knew most guest would not get back until later. I talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all. His answer was to order pizza. I found all of this very unacceptable. I'm a Platinum Member of the Marriott Rewards program, but I can say I will not stay here again after the lack of preparation they had for game that started at 8:00 pm."
"2","We love the Marriott because they are usually in great locations and are clean. They belong to a nice corporation. \n\nWe only stayed at this Marriott for a night. Checked in around 11pm. The guest service was awesome as usual. The room a/c didn't feel cool enough but granted we came from Northern Virginia where heat wasn't turned on at night. But it's a perfect location. Within a couple blocks of restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying here on weekend getaways again."
"2","Stayed only one night for the Belk Bowl and it was a comfortable & good night. The hotel is very nice & the reps were all hospitable. It is always a relief to be met with a genuine smile when I get to my destination. Our room was clean & comfortable. I slept like a baby & didn't notice any city noise on 10th floor. Breakfast was delicious. I had the traditional French toast...so yummy! Thank you Marriott for another good experience."
"2","The Light Factory is awesome. It puts on very cool photography exhibits and has a variety of educational programs for digital and film photography for teens and adults. One example: The Light Factory did an amazing photo and art exhibit on post-Katrina New Orleans after taking a group of high school photography students on a trip there."
"1","This place has some wonderful sandwiches. I work in the building next door so I frequent most of the dowtown (or as they call it uptown) establishments during the week.  They offer Boar's Head and normally offer a daily or weekly special.  This place gets a 2 b/c they have the worst customer service, the unfriendliest staff, and got a 94.5 on cleaniness rating. Although the sandwiches are good its not worth having some lady bark at you for your order before you can even see the menu.  They need to hire some people that can smile."
"2","Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and I am happy I did. The store front and decor are completely ordinary, but don't be put off by the lack ambiance. My waiter could not have been more pleasant and yet not overbearing at all. He greeted cheerfully and invited me to choose a table.\n\nI received a complimentary salad of crispy fresh lettuce with ginger dressing. A tasty treat to start. I ordered a spicy yellow tail and spider roll which were both well made and tasty. The rice was done perfectly and the sauces complimented the rolls nicely. \n\nThe price was very reasonable. My lunch with salad and two rolls was $ 14.42.\n\nI've been looking for good sushi in Charlotte and have not been able to find it too often. Today, I did. A definite keeper. I will be back!"
"1","I was looking for a new sushi spot, but was somewhat disappointed with the experience. First, I was the only customer, during my entire dining experience..which somewhat scares me. I was seated and served a complimentary salad. The salad was good, but overdressed..crazy overdressed. I ordered the onion soup and egg rolls. The onion soup was basically broth with a few onions, but no real onion flavor, which is what I was hoping for. As for the egg rolls, can I say frozen.\nOnto the sushi. I chose a roll based on the waitresses recommendation, however it had a mango sauce that was so overwhelming I sent it back. I was not offered anything else and was charged for the roll, $13.95, after eating only two pieces. I questioned the server about being charged and she expressed the fact she told me what I was getting and I ordered it. Whoa, was I surprised. I expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do. She disappeared and came out with an older women. Upon returning to my table she did remove the roll, but was very unpleasant about it. \nAlthough I appreciate the fact they removed the roll, but was not impressed otherwise and will stick to my other favorites."
"2","Very tasty!  We always get the vegetable tempora because its hard to find good vegetable tempora.  It really is outstanding!  The house made ginger sauce on the salad is amazing as well!  Sometimes the service is a little... non existant.  Had to wait a while to get the check. They brought boxes and we waited about 15 minutes after that for the check. There were only 2 other customers in the restaurant."
"2","When you love your clothes, you need to find a dry cleaner you trust. I can't tell you how many times I've had garments ruined - buttons go awry, seaming comes loose, hemming done unevenly. It's a sad, sad day when your dry cleaner screws up your favorite (insert item of clothing here). Thankfully, I trust Rosa and the crew at Eden Cleaners. They love my clothes almost as much as I do - and that's saying a LOT. \n\nI have thrown just about everything Rosa's way, including alterations, hemming, dry cleaning, pressing, etc. You may pay a bit more here, considering the convenience factor of Uptown. But they do a fabulous job and it's super easy to park in the garage, hop out and enter in \""650\"" on the key pad and someone will let you in through the back door. Easy peasy! *I've also heard that they deliver dry cleaning in the Uptown area but haven't used that service myself. *\n\nIn more than three years only two garments have come back less than perfect and Rosa offered to fix them free of charge both times. They are quick, professional and downright sunny every time I walk in. Oh, and she's remembered my name since 2007 and often asks if I've been working out more. Um, I love you Rosa.\n\nSo, bring your favorite garments over to Eden Cleaners, they will take great care of them...and you."
"2","When my favorite silk blouse had a run-in with a particularly evil soap dispenser, I knew my regular dry cleaner wouldn't cut it. Nicole W. recommended Eden Cleaners, so I rushed right over. Three days and $7 later, I was reunited with my blouse, looking as good as new. Aaaand, I promptly spilled carnitas and salsa down the front. And once again, Rosa gets my blouse back to me, looking like it had never stepped foot in a Mexican restaurant.\n\nThe best part, every time I stop in, Rosa tells me I'm pretty. Customer for life!"
"1","I don't trust Eden Cleaners. \n\nI used their online service to pick up my laundry. For three days no one called or picked up the clothes. After several calls, I finally spoke to someone. Clothes were picked up and returned. Their service was fine.\n\nWhat bothers the snot out of me is that no one answers the phone as \""Eden Cleaners\"". After they say, \""hello?\"" I have to ask if I've reached Eden cleaners. I can deal with the very broken English, but I can't deal with the non-conventional ways of answering the phone or doing business online.\n\nWhile it's more expensive to have the clothes done at the hotel, at least I know that they'll get done."
"1","I went to this cleaner for convenience. What a mistake it was. They absolutely destroyed my favorite dress. It went in perfectly fine and came out pink! The woman told me it was not her problem and that they weren't a magic shop! Absolutely terrible service. I have had the dress cleaned before with absolutely no problem. Use at your own risk."
"1","City Tavern is an attractive restaurant in the heart of uptown Charlotte. They boast a nice menu with a great seafood selection, so we gave it a shot. For starters, we went here on a Saturday night at 8pm and were practically the only ones inside, which is never a good sign. I ordered a mojito, which was really good and refreshing - one of my favorite parts of our experience there. \n\nI ordered the seabass and it really wasn't anything spectacular. This is definitely one of those restaurants that gets the job done, it is clean and the food is OK, but I would probably wouldn't think to go here when looking for a good restaurant on a Saturday night. If you do head over, look for my second favorite part of our experience, our waiter. He was so cool and absolutely hysterical!! I can't remember his name, but look for the guy who looks like Dave Chappelle. You'll get dinner and a show."
"2","Okay, seriously I do live close by, but the food is pretty decent here and I really like the double deck outdoor seating when its not too hot.  Good draught beer and we never seem to have to wait too long.  \n\nTry the ahi app and the blackened seafood for dinner."
"1","I visited Charlotte and decided to go here, cause it was crowded. The wait was 35-50 minutes. I really didn't know what to choose --- so i end up ordering Beer Battered Fish and Chips (os os) and the ribs and chicken combo w/ fries (os os). There was nothing really special about the food. Charlotte doesn't have much to offer when it comes to food =P"
"2","Ate here the other night and would TOTALLY go back. Very spacious, awesome bar and outdoor seating available. I had the Hawaiin Chicken dish - you have to try this, it was incredible! They chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly, with pineapple sauce on top and rice pilaf underneath. I am craving it again as I type this. It is also very cool to walk into a place and order your beer by saying \""red, ale, amber, port\"" etc. I will definitely be back."
"2","Stopped by here during a recent swing through Charlotte on biz. I was looking for an relaxed \""Pub-food-plus\"" type of joint with good beer and in Rock Bottom, I found it. \n\nThe bar staff was helpful and generous with samples from their 8ish original beers. The Brown Ale is delicious (and award winning) and my favorite of the group.\n\nWhile Rock Bottom features beer, they hang their hat on food. The nachos were loaded with fixin's, and the chili is chunky and decidedly above-average. \n\nIt's a relaxed, inviting and warm destination for anyone looking for an afterwork drink or evening out."
"1","I'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience. We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas, is that alright for you? After finally ordering a pitcher of beer (there were six of us, so four of us had one beer) the waitress tells us that it is such a high gravity, she says 9% that if any of us have more than three she'll have to start figuring out who the DD is and maybe cut people off. Not only was it an uncomfortable comment, but we looked back at the menu and the beer was only 5.7%. Needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks. Then when the waitress brought out our chili, she told us that the green onions looked nasty and she didn't feel comfortable serving them. I was kind of grossed out by that point. Couldn't you have just lied to me and told me you were out? I don't wanna hear about nasty things in the kitchen, it made me really not want to eat. Luckily the food was good, however the service was reason enough not to return."
"1","Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah, it's pretty cool that they brew their own beers and they are located on Tryon but... eh.  This spot is one step above an Applebees.  Dont get me wrong, I kinda like Applebees.  Just dont expect anything amazing.  I would suggest sitting outside and enjoying a nice day.  That might make it a little better.  I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
"1","The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location, it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night, but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced, with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent, it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."
"2","You'll know when you've hit it.\n\n(Ba-dum crash!)"
"2","Great location downtown Charlotte, nice menu and wonderful Hand Crafted Beer Selection.\n\nSports bar atmosphere with quite a few TV's located around and a few Pool Tables too."
"1","A disappointing experience! I have been to Rock Bottom several times before this trip. The pizza always seemed decent and the microbrews were okay too. Nothing special, but the location and atmosphere has always been nice.\n\nThe insert menu excited me when I got here...Oktoberfest...was here. I love German food and I love Oktoberfest beers. I mean...love...really love Oktoberfest beers. \n\nThe German Burger: half a pound of meat with some cabbage, mushrooms, Swiss, and ketchup....on a fresh pretzel bun. Sounds great, right? Wrong! It tasted like a big meat patty...no flavor...nothing! Just plain boring.\n\nThe Oktoberfest Sampler Platter: Some type of \""Knackwurst\"" corndog...which tasted pretty much like Pronto Pups at any northern state fair...not bad...but not warm in the middle. The fried corned beef and cabbage things were nice...but seemed pretty Irish to me. This also came with a fresh Bavarian pretzel with a variety of mustards...nice.\n\nNow here we go! Rock Bottom describes their Oktoberfest beer as Full-bodied with a classic sweet flavor, Rocktoberfest is an award-winning Oktoberfest-style beer that is rich with a toasted malt character and finishes with a subtle crisp hop.\n\nNow...if I was allowed to swear here...I would. In what world this beer is toasty, malty, finishing a tad hoppy...or award winning is beyond me. This beer is Budweiser with some caramel food coloring. This beer had no personality whatsoever! I can say that it finished nicely...by having no taste at all. Great job! I'm glad a terribly sub-par meal only set me back sixty bucks...I'd probably need a second job if I decided to eat somewhere with good food."
"2","There is a wide variety of food choices here, from salads to pizza. Steaks and seafood, Mexican to Cajun. Something for everyone, and great beers on tap all brewed in house as well as bottled beers and a full bar. The servers are friendly and efficient, they know their menu. An excellent choice out side of the box is the \""Bistro filet\"", ask for the Ale sauce on the side. My all time favorite is the Shrimp and Crab tower, with avocado in it and Pita on the side."
"1","Ate here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.\n\nThat was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.\n\nGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. \n\nOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.\n\nDefinitely will not return."
"1","This place has a fantastic outdoor patio and makes for a great place to sip back and enjoy a few beers. We split the brewer's feast and particularly enjoyed the southwest egg rolls with a roasted jalapeno ranch dressing. I enjoyed their winter seasonal and their Sweet Magnolia brown ale. However, they didn't make my top favorite beer selection and other than that I really didn't find any of their brews to be that great. Overall, I'd recommend going elsewhere with a better beer selection from multiple breweries. Of course, much of this review reflects my distaste for chain restaurants and breweries."
"1","Meh, indeed.  Decent beer and excellent service. But it's chain food and it didn't do much for me."
"1","My boyfriend and I went here hoping for better-than-average bar food and a good home brew while in Charlotte, but it was just meh. We were told we would wait for 20 minutes which seemed ridiculous as there were open tables all over the restaurant and bar and finally got seated in one of these open tables after 40 minutes of waiting. The $10 calamari was a very small portion, the sauces were obviously not made in-house, and the pieces of calamari were TINY! We both ordered mediocre salads and didn't find their brews to be anything special. Would have rather spent $50 elsewhere."
"1","Went here for a pre-show meal. We were looking forward to the beers, and fortunately or unfortunately (depending upon your viewpoint), that was the highlight of the meal. I ordered the ribs, which were dry and not that hot. Also they were not that tender. Their sweet sauce, however, was good, but no sauce can make up for poorly cooked ribs. My wife had the chicken pesto pasta. While that was decent, it wasn't exciting either.\n\nSure, the plates were \""sizeable.\"" But PRICEY for what you get. I mean, we could have gone to Aria Italian nearby and gotten a MUCH better quality of food for LESS than this place! I mean, we went here thinking we would get a good value. Unfortunately, it's more than a lot of other comparable places in Uptown.\n\nToo many other choices in Charlotte to come back here."
"2","Been to Rock bottom multiple times, just as always had a great time. Our server was Donna, great server and she knew a lot about the beers.\n\nThe manager was walking around checking in on tables so I asked him for his suggestion from the menu. He suggested the Chicken Parmesan pasta with the \""Smoky Mountain\"" pasta sauce and a side of marinara.\n\nIt. was. amazing. Perfect recommendation. Had a great time. We'll definitely be back."
"1","This place has a decent menu, it's executed pretty well, and they (of course) make their own beers. Too bad it's often packed to the rafters with \""former frat boy turned middling banking executives who still listen to DMB on the side\"". I'm happy to eat there if I happen to be uptown and the crowd wants to... but I try to avoid it whenever I can."
"2","57 dollars for two steak meals and plenty of beer is not a bad price at all. Being in the center of downtown you would think there prices would be higher but they have some amazing choices and beers for a good price. I enjoyed there red ale more then there brown but both where great and my wife said that her kolsch was well made also. Ive been here several times and will be returning several more."
"1","I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency.  You can go there one night and have great food and service, whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits, stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover, they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot, prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get, or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes..."
"2","Absolutely delicious! Ordered cherry glazed, hazelnut-crusted chicken. The vegs? They didn't overcook carrots! Yay! My teen ordered avocado chicken sandwich - it's BIG and avocado, were ripe and fresh! Nice service! Go. I almost died there... so was my teenager daughter (she was picky but she loved her order very much)."
"1","I have mixed feelings about Rock Bottom. I enjoyed the inexpensive beer sampler. The main reason we went  here though was for my fiance to try a specific burger. Unfortunately that burger was \""86'd\""... as was her second choice. We weren't told that until 10 to 15 minutes after ordering, which delayed our dinner. Otherwise what we got was OK. We went for a second time with some friends to watch a Panthers game, and, again, it was just OK. i tried a third time and not only did our food take a long time, but it was clear that mine was made first and had just been sitting out because nothing was warm. Three strikes and you're out in my book. I will not be going back. If you do go, I recommend going when it isn't busy (as it was with my first and third experience)."
"1","The ONLY reason this place gets two stars and not one is because our server was fantastic: he split our bills no problem, didn't screw up water orders, put up with a colleague's silly antics, and got our food to us promptly. \n\nThe food was bad, yo. Like, below Applebee's bad. We split an order of guacamole. For $8.50, you get a tiny dish of it and a bunch of chips in a little bucket. What a crock. The guacamole was fine, but for $8.95, you can go to Vida over at Epicenter and get (as I wrote in a previous review) a veritable fuck-ton of it prepared tableside.\n\nI also ordered the Southwestern Turkey burger. It sounded delightful - peppers mixed in with the meat, jack cheese, fried jalepe\u00f1os - but tasted like garbage. The meat was tasteless but spicy, the jalepe\u00f1os were in five tiny bits on top of the burger, the cheese was like plastic. The bun was overly bread-y. I ordered with a side of fruit, which was disappointingly not fresh.\n\nMy colleagues complained that their food sucked too: overly dry burger for $10 and a dried out piece of salmon for $18.50. What the fuck.\n\nPeople, don't go here unless you want to get ripped off and eat shitty food."
"2","Beer is good, strawberry margarita is delicious!! The jalape\u00f1o pretzel bites are an appetizer worth paying for!! Wish it wasn't just seasonal, they should have it all year round! Food was so yummy! Our server Brittany was so nice and helpful! Definitely a place I would visit again :)"
"2","A very nice brewpub - a recent and extensive renovation provides great atmosphere.  Blue cheese bacon burger was excellent.  Their brews are very well balanced and enjoyable - something on tap for everyone."
"2","Get to the Chase:\n\nPros:\n1) Fantastic ribs! Succulent, juicy, and came right off the bone\n2) Exceptional service (I think I saw our waitress spend half the time on her hands and knees wiping off crumbs and food that other customers left under their table)...I have never seen a restaurant where that happened...not only that she was always genuinely smiling and making sure we had fresh water\n3) Fantastic beer selections (would highly recommend the beer sampler)\n4) First time I actually LOVED coleslaw...perfect balance of slaw, mayo, and tangy sweetness (accented by the freshly cut slivers of apple)\n5) Desserts do equal justice to their delicious entrees\n\nCons:\n1) None"
"1","I wasn't impressed with this place. The menu sounds really great& the waitress suggested I get the chicken bacon Mac & cheese, but it was disappointing to say the least."
"1","Go here if you enjoy waiting in the lobby when there are tons of open tables and being rudely treated by the hostess!  The food is just ok bar food.  The beer is awesome I will admit and the servers are pretty attentive.  I would rather drive down to Myrtle beach or Atlanta to it's sister restaurant Gordon Biersch.  The food is much better and the people who work there will treat you much better.  If you really need to go there to enjoy the beer, I'd eat elsewhere and then just sit at the bar."
"2","3.5 stars.  Nothing special, but everything was fairly well done.  Went for a lunch meeting and had the southwest salad.  The jalapeno ranch was made in house and was great.  The baguette on the side was a nice touch.  Service was perfect: attentive but not hovering.  We were able to get in and out quickly.  Other diner thought the ahi tuna salad was good as well.  Tuna was perfectly done and contained a good sized lunch portion.  Other meals (chicken avocado sandwich and bacon cheeseburger) looked uninteresting."
"2","Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!"
"1","Their beers are really good, I just wish the food was that great too. I ordered the bacon chicken mac and cheese, which instantly got my mouth watering just thinking about it. I ate a little bit, but I didn't want to finish it. Way too much pepper or spices, and I could hardly taste the cheese. It would be better if they didn't label it as a mac and cheese, because it didn't taste like that at all to me. It came with a slice of french bread on the side, but it was plain. No butter on it or any on the side. Kinda weird.\n\nMy sister raved about her hazelnut crusted chicken, but I wasn't too impressed by that either. I ended up just drinking my dinner, which is just fine by me! :)"
"1","The food was rock bottom. \n\nIt was so disappointing that  me and two my friends could not finish our meals."
"2","Great lunch!  Sat at the bar - busy spot - they have lots of take out orders.\nBartender do an ok job keeping up.\nSalad was delish!  A little too much arugula , so I removed some and it was better.\nWill look forward to coming back next visit to Charlotte"
"2","I had a fabulous time sitting at the bar on a busy Saturday. Meredith is an incredibly attentive bartender, regardless of her busy surroundings. Great beer. The food was pretty rockin'! Get the Mac and cheese!"
"1","first off, we walked in for a bigger table (6) and watched the manager, who didn't address us at ALL, make the host who had an injured arm put together 2 tables and rearrange the chairs without any help. The manager even made eye contact and still couldn't even say hello to us or the 2 people behind us waiting as well.  The server provided great service and the beer was good. The food was another story. The burgers were over done and the personal pizza was burnt on the bottom and missing cheese from a whole slice. I made pizzas in a deli for a few years and I must say I don't know how you can do that but there's a first time for everything. The house salad was 90 % white and 10 % green, weak! All in all the pizza got replaced and taken off the bill but was that enough to entice a return visit? Maybe for a beer....."
"2","I met a couple of girlfriends here for dinner and drinks on Friday evening. Parking was easy because the restaurant is attracted to a parking garage and...yes! They do validate parking. \n\nWe started in the bar area, which was pretty crowded. We were hoping to grab a table but quickly found out they take reservations at those tables so we were moved to the main dining area once everyone arrived. \n\nThe bartenders were awesome! With so many beers on tap, I had no clue which to try first! So she let me sample some of her favorites and I found that the Kolsch was a winner!! It was light and refreshing and a perfect compliment to our appetizers. \n\nWe ordered the Brewery chicken nachos and Southwest egg rolls, both were delicious! The nachos come with an entire dish of freshly made salsa and the they load you up on the toppings: cheese, sour cream,black beans, chicken, onions, jalape\u00f1os and guacamole. The egg rolls are deep fried and stuffed with chicken, beans, red peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, corn and pepper jack cheese! Yum. \n\nFor dinner I went with the Southwest Turkey burger. The turkey burger is mixed with peppers and onions which adds a really nice flavor to the meat! They then top it with lettuce tomato, avocado mayo, fried peppers, sliced avocado and pepper jack cheese. I really enjoyed it! The fries weren't my favorite...they were shoe string cut and a bit too crunchy but at least they came out hot! \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely return and recommend a visit to anyone!"
"1","We went for lunch on Sunday Afternoon.  We sat there for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged us or came to our table.  A waitress passed our table two times and chose not to make eye contact with us.  Servers congregated at the hostess stand.  We walked out and still nobody noticed.  This used to be my favorite place uptown.  Really disappointed."
"1","Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park. \n\n We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And, the food was cold.\n\nThe kicker is that this  wasn't the first time this has happened.  A few weeks ago we all got exactly the same horrible level of service with cold mediocre food.\n\nIf I could give negative star rating I would."
"1","My girlfriend and I were part of a friend's birthday party of about 12 adults on a Thursday night. It was not especially crowded (no wait) and we had reservations.\n1. Nobody took our drink orders or brought us water for over 20minutes.\n2. When they brought out all the appetizers, ours was not among them, because it was never put in. When it finally came out, it was clear the nachos were rushed and they were not especially good.\n3. When the entree came out, we were brought the incorrect dish, at this point I had more than enough of the place, so I told them to forget about it and bring the check.\n4. Everyone had finished their meals for nearly an hour before the checks were sporadically brought out. After all the checks were brought out, we had to pull the waitress aside and specifically ask for her to bring ours.\n5. During this whole time, there was no one who looked like a manager to be found. Everyone at the table was clearly upset by the service, yet management never showed its face.\n\nThis was, by far, the worst dining experience I have ever been a part of and I would not recommend this overrated establishment to anyone."
"2","My wife and I went here last weekend, it was really good.  We were just going to sit at the bar and have a drink but someone ordered pizza next to us and it looked awesome.  We ordered a pizza and new people sitting next to us started asking us about the pizza.  The food was good, the bar tenders were nice and the beer was good.  We will be back."
"1","Went last night with in-laws for mother in laws bday.We always have loved the place and it is our go to place when we have something to celebrate and even when we don't.  Walked right in, we're seated, server was pleasant. Mentioned it was for mother in laws birthday and she was nice about it.\n\nOrdered drinks and an appetizer. ..This is where things went slightly pear shaped. Server came back and told us the appetizer was delayed. No big beal, things happen. \n\nFood comes and as always, was completely wonderful. Chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers. More pear shaped, waitress was no where to be found for 20 minutes. Wife was out of beer and spicy food minus drink.....she waited. Finally I got up and had to get another server to get a refill. She started with \""I am not your server....\"" but said she would take care of it. To her credit she did. \n\nManager comes over, very nice, apologized for the appetizer and days she will cover it. Server shows up and is rather standoffish. Not rude per se but moody. Not sure if it was my stunt with the beer or the manager but either way not our fault. More waiting for desert, more drinks, something and then the server does show up with the bill no questions asked, not a thing.\n\nThe rating is not for the appetizer,  like I said things happen. It was not for the lack of drinks, it was for the apathy. At least come by and check on us, tell us the app is coming, but the server seemed to say, \""the app screwed my tip so why try\"". If the place was hopping I would get it, but it was early afternoon. \n\nAnyway long story short: great food, apathetic service, use to be a go to place even with the hour drive but we may\n be finding another one."
"2","If I could design the perfect all-around restaurant, this would be it! Casual, but not too much. Wide range of food: from wings, to burgers, steaks, salads, fish tacos, and a ton more. New and clean inside, with an awesome bar area as well as private tables. I also love their outdoor seating, both the front and back sides. I've been coming here for almost ten years now, and still love it. The perfect neighborhood restaurant, whether you want a full steak dinner, or just wings and beer with friends."
"1","I have been to several Rock Bottoms including Denver, CO and this one was less than impressive. I'm new to Charlotte so I've been waiting to try this Rock Bottom out.  Went on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. I took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol. The restaurant wasn't very busy so we got seated right away.  Our server (which I didn't get his name) appeared about 5 minutes after we got seated, got our drinks and then we ordered.  We didn't see him again until after our food was brought to us. We only saw him twice after he checked to see if we had our food, and one of those two times was to hand us the check. The food was so-so.  My son had a hamburger which was delicious - my chicken bruschetta was fair but cold and the broccoli had no butter, seasoning, nothing.  It was over priced for what the meal consisted of. I gave two stars because  I was disappointed mainly with the service more so than the food. I've never had bad service or a bad meal at the Rock Bottoms I've been to in the past so was expecting the same high standards that I'm used to.  Might try again, but it will be a while."
"2","I had the Tuscan Chicken Pasta. It was very well seasoned. My son-in-law had the Cajun Pasta, being from Louisiana it wasn't very spicy, but good nonetheless. Pleasant atmosphere, good service."
"1","This place was great for atmosphere and large groups but the food actually sucked.  We ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu and our server was pretty slow and forgetful. She brought one of us crab dip that was cold (supposed to be served hot), then took forever to bring the drinks back. I asked if the southwest egg rolls were very spicy before I ordered, she said no and low and behold I get them and they are spicy.  The drink (margarita) was very strong and not sweet enough. Overall they get a D for food and an A for ambience and location."
"1","Came in with a buddy of mine to a familiar place that always delivers during my travels. We sat down, not too many clients in the restaurant and service started out well with our server Imani. However, it became evident that either we were placed in a section different from the areas she was working as we kept seeing her less and less or I can just ignore my guest because I think I'm cute and smile and everything will be okay. At the end of our meal, which was very good, she offered us dessert, we opted for another beer which never came. We would catch a glance here and there of her for the next 20 minutes and finally she came over and asked if I beer made it to us. Did you bring me my drink? Then no, I have not gotten my beer. She would look for it right away, but I asked her to just close us out as it just wasn't nice to be there any longer, no excuse, no apology, just said okay, smiling away and walked away to what I hoped would be a quick return with my bill. She again left for another 10 minutes. When she returned I asked her what exactly happened that our drinks never made it to us? Was someone else supposed to bring it, did she forget? She said that someone else usually brings it, she was helping out the bar by bringing our drinks, someone must have taken it, oh my god, i'll just smile at these guys and everything will be fine.... no.... i just want good service. The server who was on our side was taking care of all his clients, bringing them drinks so im pretty sure I was getting the run around. I asked her who the manager was and she said Michael and again walked away. Pretty disrespectful attitude to have in a customer service environment. Next time I come to Charlotte I need to stick to the many many other places with great food and folks that want to take care of their clients. My opinion is that the food here was darn good and consistent, the beer is excellent, the service which is the most important, was \""rock bottom\""."
"2","The best steak I have had in my entire life. The spicy buttery sauce on top that steak OMG! I crave it daily, but my pockets can't afford it. Awesome atmosphere too."
"2","Food is good, beer is amazing! Highly recommend stopping in if you're in the neighborhood."
"2","I had my wedding here this past weekend.  It was awesome.  The staff - especially Nathan Hoffman - were amazing to work with.  The food was excellent, the setting was beautiful and things went according to plan.  I cannot say enough good things about Nathan.  He was great to work with and made the whole process so easy.  The City Club was the only venue we looked at that said they would do a tasting for us.  The food was excellent and the wine was outstanding.  \n\nThey even gave us a picnic basket of goodies when we left the venue - wine, cheese, cheesecake, crackers and more - some nice yummy midnight snacks!\n\nEveryone we worked with, dealt with and interacted with at every level was a pleasure to deal with.  Nathan really helped with the planning and the scheduling and made the entire process so much better for us."
"1","This place Was horrible!!! The steak was over cooked and tough, the service was so slow that it took us 2 hours to get our food the wine was delivered after 40 minutes. Sure the view is cool but really?? Glad some one else paid or I would be MAD."
"2","Came here for lunch with some colleagues.  \n\nAmazing place with so many cool rooms to check out.  Look to your left-there's a silent auction going on. Look to your right-two businessmen shaking hands. And look outside-breathtaking view of Charlotte from the 30th floor.\n\nService is solid. Very propers and stuff. Hyper-reactive to remove plates in front of you... so you can get bidness done.\n\nLunch buffet was so-so.  Cooking in quantity always loses that special touch.  Uneven cooking, undercooked, etc.  Probably better if you order off the menu.\n\nI think I might want to join. \n\ndmo out"
"1","Don't Get Married Here. My husband and I got married in July. We had sit down dinner and chose 3 meals for our guests to choose from. The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's. This place is beautiful but not worth the money, stress, or headache."
"1","This fast food place almost ALWAYS gets my order wrong. They charge me for things that they don't have. The lettuces on the garden salad is always weltered. Besides the staff being EXTREMELY unprofessional, the wait time is always long."
"2","I had a great experience here. All the staff was friendly and Dr. Price was fantastic! When it came time to get new glasses and contacts, Jill was wonderful to work with, too! She helped me stay in budget and searched for every discount I could get with my insurance and current offers through manufacter rebates. I've been in Charlotte 14 years and this is the best place I've found for my eye care, and trust me, I've made the rounds!"
"2","I love Dr. W (his name is long and confusing to spell... let alone say) and this location (downtown in the BBandT building next to the Caribou- bonus!).  He is very patient and thorough and just a really nice guy.  His staff was super helpful in helping me pick out glasses and training me on how to put in and remove contacts (which was awful but not their fault).  They also filed everything with my insurance company, which is great.\n\nI also love that they call and email to remind of upcoming appointments.  I really appreciate this service.\n\nThey also have a location on Colony Rd., near the Lodge.\n\nI am a person who hates going to any type of doctor.  They really make this a nice experience."
"2","I recently visited this eye doctor after moving to the area, and had a great experience. I saw Megan Price Osborne and she was super friendly and thorough. They offered convenient appointment hours for me to stop in over my lunch hour. I had to go back to work right after so I couldn't have my eyes dilated, they said to come back whenever I had time for it, so I did and it was fast and easy. The staff has been friendly and helped me fit my glasses on several occasions, even though I hadn't purchased them there. I would definitely recommend this place from my experiences so far."
"2","I recently went for a general optometry appointment and found Dr. Price very nice and knowledgable. The staff there are very friendly and helpful as well!"
"2","Wonderful experience!! Staff was very nice, was flexible with scheduling, and explained exam during each step. I would definitely recommend visiting them to friends and family!"
"1","I got the fried rice with beef, and it was so-so.  I've had better.  The restaurant was decent andthe staff was friendly and fast.  But the food was just ok, and I have to admit that while I was eating it I was a little worried if I would get sick or not.  \nBut to be fair the other people I was eating with loved their food.  I heard the tempura vegetables were great.  Unfortunatley my experience was just mediocre. Thats the way it goes though, but  I will give them another shot , roll with the punches and try a different dish.  I'll keep you posted."
"2","one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \""asian\"""
"2","Excellent food and good portions for the price."
"2","Their food is made of magic."
"2","A friend at work was having a bad day, and mournfully insisted that the only thing that would help was some soul food. Naturally, I was along for the ride. \nSimmons is definitely one of 'those places.' You know, the one that people talk about when they brag that it's where \""people who are really from the Carolinas\"" go, and it's apparent. This place is as holey in the wall as holes in the wall come. \n\nAtmosphere: I think the best way to describe it would be nonchalant. When you walk in, they know you're there. People look up at you if you're not a regular. Yes, they'll clean off a table and seat you, make some chat, get your drinks and take your order at what is the epitome of the southern pace. If you're a foodie who taps their toe if it takes more than 5 minutes to wipe off a table, then this place isn't for you. If you have some time to kill and want to feel like you're eating in someone's kitchen that they extended to include a few other lucky people, then you've hit jackpot. \n\nService: I had to keep reminding myself that I wasn't related to this person. I love it when waitstaff have just the right amount of crabby/fussy/humor, and this was a prime example. The attitude was, \""Hangon a dang minute, I'll get there when I get there, you'll eat what we give you, and girl you did NOT finish all of your vegetables.\"" \n\nFood: Mmmmmmm. Ribs are good, and I found out pretty quick that how fast you make nice is directly proportional to how much food you get. Luckily, I got saddled with leftovers. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, at a decent price, with that tangy sweet sauce that so many people like. I'm more of a smoky myself, but I can recognize good sauce when it's given to me. Complimentary cornbread at the beginning of the meal was plain and delicious, and the collards weren't that overly cooked mushy that I can't stand. Very good food experience.\n\nOverall, one of those places where you go for the people just as much as the food, and a true southern food experience if there ever was one. If you can make decent convo, sit down and eat something delicious, and if not, gtfo, mon hommes."
"1","well well well (please push me in)\n\nI remember (as everyone else has stated) back in the day when this was the spot. \""Dot\"" (the owner) is/was a Church member of Community Outreach Christian Ministries and after \""chuch\"" we would make our way.. as soon as se would see me.. Heyyyyy baaaby!!\n\nyep.. please give me... BAKED CHICKEN (1/4), MAC & CHEESE, FRIED OKRA, DRESSING, and ARNOLD PARMER (TEA / LEMONAID). wth is this new thing called \""the oboma tea\"".... my god!!\n\n(my eyes are rolling in the back of my head as i type, singing...MEMORIESSSSSSSS, IN THE CORNER OF MY MINDDDDDDDDDDDDDD)\n\nfast foward to current state of \""Simmons\"". \nThis place being kinda a growing-up spot it saddens me to see it. Now it looks like it survied Katrina. \n\nFish - Not like it used to be.\nMac * Cheese - i agree w/ other reviews\nokra - you'll probably get about 12 pieces (15 if your nice)\nwhat happend to the plates, cups?? (as in real plates, spoons, forks etc) its all plastic and styrofoam.. signs the money is tigtening up.)\n\niF i return it will be just to speak and maybe pick up a drink (tea)."
"1","The sanitation score for this place was 93.0.....I guess that was a red flag that I missed before I placed my order.\n\nI will start with the 'good'. The cashier was very polite, inviting, and helpful. Thank you.\nThe cornbread was 'decent'. Hooray that it wasnt the Jiffy brand.\n\nNow the 'bad' ( and I mean REALLY bad!)\nRemember that stuff we called 'mystery meat' in grade school? Well apparently it's still around except now they bury it under BBQ sauce and call it meatloaf at Simmons restaurant. Arrrggghhh! The baked chicken w/dressing was 'do-able', but you can get the Banquet frozen chicken entrees at your local grocery and do much better. \nThe food was horrendous! The broccoli casserole was watered down and over cooked....soggy. Seems like they used imitation cheese, because it certainly didnt melt. (I even nuked it 4 minutes on HIGH in the microwave.....nope, it didnt melt). The so-called brown gravy was tasteless and bland. \n\nDon't waste your time...."
"2","Borderline sanitation. Delicious food. Collards. Mac 'n cheese. Meatloaf. Obama tea."
"2","Just had dinner at Presto earlier and I am STUFFED. For those of you hummus fans, you need to get this as an appetizer, it is excellent. Comes with warm pita slices for dipping, and a side of yogurt sauce as well. Delicious. \n\nThe atmosphere here was great, not a huge place but lots of room and they were accomodating two large parties at the time we were there. I ordered the flounder and shrimp francese, over creamy risotto with asparagus - PHE.NO.ME.NAL!!!!! This dish was so good I literally could not stop eating it, even when I abslutely could not fit anymore. I probably should have stopped, but couldn't. \n\nMy one reason for keeping this from being a 5 star restaurant was the heat - it was so warm in there, we literally could not wait to get out of there. And that doesn't say much considering it was just as hot outside. But it makes it difficult to fully enjoy a meal when you are breaking a sweat eating it. Maybe we went on a bad night. Either way, we are definitely going to go back here, it was excellent, even down to the ambiance and service."
"2","I work downtown and we have ordered dinner when we have worked late!!! Their apps are great and large enough to have as a meal! Love their hummas just the right amount of lemon Olive oil and garlic! Yum! Another favorite is the Asian salad."
"1","Ok.. Maybe I went here at the wrong time or something but I have to put in my two cents.  This is not a really cool hang out.  The bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly.  I went around 5pm on a Tuesday, but I don't think that was the problem.  The place just seemed small and shabby to me.  Im sorry to bash it because there are a lot of really good reviews here.  So just take my review with a grain of salt.  I will update my review when I give it a second chance and make it through my beer and order some food.  Sorry guys.. I would say make your way deeper into the city and try someplace else.  \n\nI gave it one star at first.. That was too harsh.. \n\n-Ian M."
"2","My husband and I had the most awesome experience at Prestos our waiter Alex and Alaina were the best they suggested the shrimp & grits and the chicken martini and both were great! We will definently be back thanks for a great dining experience."
"1","Oh, Presto, my experience here was just - not - good.  First, my rating of 2/5 stars is based primarily on the food, not the service.  \n\nI dined with a friend on a week night.  The restaurant was pretty empty, no wait for a table.  Our server was friendly and adequate, not magnificent.\n\nI decided to give Presto a try since they had a groupon coupon a while back.  So I had some money to spend, and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however, the sauce was, well, gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari, as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips, way more than we had dip for, which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  \n\nI ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow, this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.\n\nThe lasagna.  Well, remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well, tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon, and brown sugar.  \n\nI traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.  Fries were under seasoned.  \n\nNot going back, but I think this place may be better as a lunch destination."
"1","I came here for lunch during work.  The food was decent but 2 issues, 1 major one.  First - the water at this establishment is disgusting.  My friend got water with ice and it was awful and so I got water without ice and it was just as awful.  And I don't mean a slight aftertaste... it was very apparent to both of us that something was wrong with it.  It tasted like metal or plastic.  Which makes me worry that the water they use in cooking and other drinks like ice tea or lemonade is contaminated with something.  Second issue, not as huge, but we both ordered a sandwich, and the waitress didn't bother to ask what side we wanted - We didn't realize it came with a side until the food showed up with fries."
"1","My husband and I went to Presto on a Tuesday night around 6:30. It was very, very bad. Very bad. So very bad that I'm writing my first Yelp review.\n\nSummary: Some of the food was decent, but everything else is so so very very bad that it's not worth it. I will tell people not to go there and I will never go back.\n\n[The BAD.]\n\nThere was one guy playing hostess/waiter/bartender/bus boy, hitherto referred to as HWBBB. \n\nWe went there specifically to sit on the patio because the weather was awesome, but were told we couldn't because the HWBBB was the only one on staff.\n\nThe temperature in the restaurant was HOT. Stifling. Not normal. 70 outside, 85 inside.\n\nThe menu was schizophrenic. I had no idea what to order. Sushi, pitas, pizzas, steak. Plus a \""build a 3-course meal\"" option. I felt like I was reading the menu at Cheesecake Factory. \n\nThey played dance music? Which is just weird in a restaurant setting.\n\nThey were out of several things. I asked the HWBBB, \""What beers do you have on draft?\"" He said, \""We only have 2. We usually have 4 but we ran out of 2 today.\"" So I'm already disappointed and I don't even know what they have yet. My husband ordered a glass of Malbec and the HWBBB came back and said they didn't have it.\n\nMy order was wrong. I ordered a side salad in lieu of fries. I received an entr\u00e9e salad in addition to my meal, which still came with fries. I ordered a chicken kebob sandwich and received a beef kebob sandwich. We decided things were so bad at this point that I didn't tell the HWBBB of his error. I sucked it up and ate the stupid beef.\n\nThe beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality. Maybe stew meat. I chewed each piece the point I'd realize it wasn't going to break down any further and then spit out what remained. I'm usually not such a disgusting dining companion but this place brought out the best in me. I kept wishing for a normal chewable digestible piece but ended up eventually spitting out every single piece of beef.\n\nWe had a groupon and when the HWBBB brought the bill we got lectured on all the items the groupon did not apply towards. Like alcohol (fine) and the $20 3 course meal my husband ordered, \""because that's already a deal, but I'll make an exception, just this once.\""\n\nWe settled the bill before the dessert from my husband's meal came. Our HWBBB was puzzled that we were still sitting there and eventually asked what else he could do for us. We asked if he could bring the dessert we ordered. \n\nThe apple crisp was like flour and sugar mixed with 3 apple chunks, stuck in the microwave on high for 10 minutes, topped with ice cream.\n\n[The not so bad.]\n\nThe beef tasted good, even if I couldn't chew it.\n\nMy husband's shawarma was good.\n\nThe tzatziki sauce was very good.\n\nThe pita bread was good.\n\nThe salads were ok.\n\nThe curly fries that came with our meals were reminiscent of Jack 'n' the box, one of many other places I dislike but would rather have eaten at."
"1","We stopped in here for Dinner and it must have been an off night for them. I ordered a coke when it came it was very watered down. I commented to the waiter about the coke and his curt reply was \""I know, I get complaints about it all the time but nothing I can do about it.\"" I ordered a hamburger and when it came the bun was stale and the meat tasted freezer burned. While we were there the table next to us was complaining about the food also. Like I said maybe just an off night but we won't be back."
"1","Eh.. \n\nI had the chicken alfredo; the noodles were hard, the sauce was thin.  Boyfriend had steak au poivre, which turned out to be brown gravy dumped over the steak. Interestingly, the steak was actually really good. and the gravy was good too but brown gravy over steak does not make it steak au poivre. \n\nNot their fault, but their credit card machines were down for like an hour... they did comp us drinks while we waited though. So, let's make that a 2.5 stars."
"1","OK, first they had lunch specials posted at we walked in which it did state it was lunch until server stated.  The server took the order quick but the entrees too a while, I had smothered chicken...yummy NOT, instead of pepper jack cheese they replaced it with American cheese white and yellow, not melted, my guest had BLT soup without the \""B\"" bacon, they replaced the bowl with bacon this time and added a stalk of greenry...hummmm.  The chef salad was a presto creation...a mound of meat and cheese that didn't look nice at all.  I was till trying to figure out why service took so long it was on a few, I see why the couple outside turned around when they looked in, I wish I had.  Also if you are using a groupon, etc.  they remove the tax and tip (18%)  from the total gift check which you pay them separate from the check and you cant order the three course meal which is $20 per person.  Visit at your own risk, next time I will only do the bar and apps, but the HOT TEA was good"
"1","Restaurant dot com you've let me down once again. I've got to ask myself why do I keep doing this. I guess the good restaurants don't have to use coupons. To be fair we ordered the three steak options on the menu, all a huge disappointment. First we must of got the \""sell by this date\"" steaks because its easy to tell what a previously frozen steak tastes like.   Second the New York strip was cut by the first day of culinary school student, coincidence Johnson & Wales is so close, hmm? No offense to Johnson and Wales but every school/university has drop outs. One side was about 3/4 inch, other side an inch, and was cooked to a shoe leather consistency. No excuse for an overcooked steak ever, and all ordered medium rare.\n\nAvoid this place even if free.\n\nOh yeah should of walk out when saw it was also a \""Hookah\"" lounge, seriously?"
"1","I'm simply not a fan of this place and don't plan on going back so let me explain why... \n\nLast fall, before a panthers game I came here and had a pretty decent lunch-I had a tasty buffalo chicken wrap with fries and two Bloody Mary's (yes it was one of those Sundays) and all was good. I left for the game with a decent memory of Presto. \n\nFast forward to the new owners and disappointed is the best word that comes to mind. First, I met a co-worker for a quick lunch, which meant I wasn't hungover or imbibing, so it was a much more objective assessment. I paged through a menu that has a serious identity crisis from mediterranean to American to italian pasta dishes to typical bar food and settled on a chicken gyro sandwich...when in doubt, I always go the specialty cuisine. When it arrived it had tzatziki on the side (good) and some weird, greasy dressing drizzled inside (not good). To make things worse, after my first taste, I almost sent it back to say I ordered chicken, thinking they gave me fish...but them realized the consistency was chicken with a really bad taste. \n\nNonetheless, I ate the pita bread and wilted greens I got for a side salad and split...with a stomach ache to follow.  \n\nI really try to give places more than one try before writing a bad review but you couldn't pay me to go back for another try"
"1","Very poor service. Unremarkable at best."
"1","I've been here quite a few times since i started working uptown. I usually get the sesame chicken and rice, which is just okay at best. However, today, I got the chicken and broccoli with rice and it was just bad. The chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy. It's too bad, they have a great location and everyone who works there is very nice, but the food is borderline awful. Today was definitely my last visit."
"1","Seafood Noodle soup had slices of pork. The cilantro garnish wasn't even chopped."
"2","The biscuits are to die for.  Seriously.  The bo berry biscuits are good if you want something sweet (and I mean sweet), but you can't beat just a plain, melt in your mouth biscuit.  \n\nService is good, too.  Can't remember a time when anyone's gotten my order wrong.  You can count on them to get it right."
"1","I did some research, saw great reviews for this place and decided to try while on a trip. I love fried chicken, biscuts and potatoes so thought this was right up my alley.\n\nI went for breakfast.  The service was fast, but bottom line I wasnt impressed with the food. I got the fried chicken biscut with potatoes.  The fried chicken really didnt have any great flavor or juiciness to it. Yes the biscuts were good. The potatoes were like tater tots. Not what I expected for breakfast and nothing better than the average tater tot. No ketchup? I went back and asked for hot sauce which made it all tollerable. It wasnt horrible, it just wasnt great. \n\nIf you're looking for great fried chicken I wouldn't say this is the place."
"2","I stayed here for 2 nights while in Charlotte for business.  It's a very nice hotel.  The front desk clerk was very personable, friendly and accomodating.  My room was really nice and spacious.  I had a view of the city which was nice but I didn't get to really enjoy since I was not in the room much.  The bed... Heavenly.  The Westin is known for their Heavenly beds and it definitely was.  High thread count sheets and fluffy pillows... the best night sleep I've ever had while on vacation.  I thought about working out at the nice gym but the bed... couldn't get out of it.  Room service was good, but expensive.  $12 for pastries and fruit?!  Well it is room service and when is that ever cheap?  Had a nice stay and will probably stay here again if I have to come back to visit."
"2","I stayed at the Westin (3 nights/4 days), during a recent business trip to Charlotte and have nothing but great things to say about this location!\n\nThe interior/lobby is very nice (modern/relaxing). Check-in/checkout went smoothly and the staff's attention to detail, was very professional, yet not overbearing.\n\nThe lobby/cocktail bar area was very conducive to not only getting together to \""defuse\"" after a day of training (great couches!), but this area was also friendly to those who's day cannot pass without hopping on the laptop to check e-mail (many outlets available in the lobby/cocktail area). \n\nI utilized the fitness center early every morning (which was no small task, as it was hard to climb out of bed, as the bed/pilows, were so comfortable!). I have become a \""treadmill snob,\"" and one morning, all (6) were being used, so I hopped on the ecliptic (sp.?)  machine. I loved the interior of the fitness center as well. There are also free weights and other equipment available as well. I kept hearing that you had to pay $5 each time, but no one on the fitness staff ever approached me regarding this. \n\nThere is also a spa within the fitness center. I did not utilize this, but other coworker's utilized this opportunity.\n\nWe had our meeting within one of the conference rooms at the hotel. It was nice (modern), although as is usually the case, the room grew too cold on occasion, which was addressed by our staff, but with no noticeable difference.\n\nI noticed each morning, that our facilitator was met by the hotel staff to review the day's agenda, which I was very impressive. \n\nThe rooms were nice. Modern fixtures, with a fairly good-sized bathroom. The lotion and soap were great!\n\nThe Uptown area of Charlotte has grown and there are many great restaurants, within walking distance from the hotel.\n\nI had a great time and would recommend this hotel for a great getaway!"
"1","We recently stayed a Saturday night and I thought that the place was not very well organized... Our room had plastic cups, wrapped in plastic, like at a motel... not glasses.  The dresser was dinged up and had a panel coming loose.  Ordering room service breakfast was an ordeal, and came with 3 eggs benedict, rather than 2.  \nThe gym was fantastic and huge, but the sauna did not work properly and never really got as hot as it should have.  \nThe bed was really nice, no doubt about it, I slept much later than I normally can in a hotel.  Before leaving the room, we called to have our car brought around....  the valet never got the message.  \nIt's a beautiful hotel, it's just that the details are off and things are a bit careless.  Maybe it's recession related.  Maybe they will have to be more on their game when the Ritz opens this fall."
"1","Westin is a chain, and thus you have expectations which in this case were met: comfortable beds, good in-room coffee, and a environmentally-unfriendly but very appealing double shower head. \n\nNow, for the reasons why this hotel fails for a 4-star (Westin) hotel:\n1. FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). \n\n2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more?\n\n3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \""Try Ember,\"" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). \n\nIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one."
"1","I absolutely hate this place. Not for the amenities as they are undoubtedly the best in the business, but when you have a problem there is no one to help you. On my last stay I tried for several hours on an off trying to contact someone about the A/C in the room, or just for information about about some of the amenities. No answer. When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. \n\nI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. \n\nThe last thing, you get dinged for 18.00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room. Parking should also be included in the price of the room and if you want one of those guys at the door to park your car, pay the 25 bucks."
"1","It is amazing to me that they always seem to have a concierge on duty but they are very content to let us wait for 20 minutes to check-in or out.  I started staying here for business because I liked the design but i am constantly disappointed with the service.  It took me three tries and 10 minutes on hold to confirm my room for an additional night (all while I was running a meeting of 20 people).  The only group in that hotel that seems to have it together is the valet's.  If only it didn't take me as long to check out as to drive from the hotel to the airport."
"1","First, let me say that I travel frequently both domestically and internationally and have stayed in a variety of hotels. This is the first time I feel compelled to write a bad review. The hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible.  Bathroom had hair on the floor and smudges still on the mirror. I left a New Tempur-Pedic pillow in the room and called the hotel to recover it. Each time I was transfered  to the security desk and they requested I call back later and see if housekeeping had turned the pillow in. After about 5 or 6 calls they did say they found the pillow and I had to give my credit card info to get it shipped to me.  It was not my pillow.  I called management and received a curt response that they would refund the shipping charges. (but they have still not done this 3 weeks later). I can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service. I will never stay here again."
"2","Beautiful lounge downstairs that doubles as a lobby/workspace and hotel bar. Great place to work, wait for someone, or hang out for a drink (my work team definitely had to do all three). \n\nThe rooms were extremely nice as well with amenities (fridge and iron, essential for a work hotel room). This location is completely walkable to the rest of the downtown area. They also sometimes have flavored ice water in the lobby which was a nice touch. \n\nMy only complaint was how overpriced breakfast was (the hotel bar was a bit overpriced, but not exceedingly so). $10 for an English muffin and a coffee? However, our server was very friendly and attentive -  and they also give you your coffee in a to go cup after you finish your sit down breakfast. Nothing like 3 cups of coffee and a spare before you get to a conference."
"2","I'm in a pretty unique position to write this review as I have a law school friend who stays here almost every weekend and the wife and I meet up with him most times.  I've seen about 10-15 different rooms and we've hung out in the lobby spaces extensively, especially since we tend to start our runs from here on Sundays.\n\nI'm a big fan of this Westin.  As others have mentioned, the lounge is very modern and chic, lots of marble and a really cool Zen fountain running the length of the bar seating area.  The conference rooms are also on two separate floors adjacent to the lobby- great for easy access and they have separate elevator service that runs straight down into the parking garage.\n\nThe restaurant downstairs does a really mean breakfast buffet and their lunch menu is far from an after-thought- tasty grilled flatbreads.\n\nThe rooms are what you expect in any newer Westin- heavenly bed with mainly modern style furniture- clean lines and neutral earth tone colors.  Bathrooms are done in marble with large mirrors and glass enclosed showers.  Here's a hint for you- try to get a room or suite on the ends of the hallways- the showers have an extra window that looks out onto uptown- but the tinted glass makes sure others don't see in.  The square footage in these bathrooms is also quite a bit bigger than a standard room.\n\nI also like the views from any of the upper floors of this hotel.  Due to it's location on the edge of the uptown sky scrapers, rooms that face town have a great ariel view of uptown and/or Panthers Stadium.  But even the rooms facing the opposite direction look out towards the light rail line and South End- on clear days you can see out to Carowinds at the state line.  Really no terrible views here.\n\nMy only downgrade here is for the weekend crowds that flock into this hotel.  Interesting people watching, to say the least, but the circular driveway gets way too crowded at times and entry/exit becomes a  game of trying to move the puzzle pieces around until it all fits.  Parking is also quite expensive unless you have elite status here, but then that's pretty much anywhere in uptown.\n\nExpect larger crowds for the bigger conventions in town as this hotel is literally across the street from the convention center.  Convenient for guests but a slight traffic headache."
"2","Exactly what you would expect from a Westin property. Nice decor, rooms are up to date, good location.\n\nThe lobby bar in a little unique with the waterfall thing.  I don't know how close the uptown restaurants are from a walking perspective but a nice place to stay and have a meeting."
"2","Like this Westin better than any I've stayed in. Lobby area is a large open space that gives me a travler-friendly feeling. Staff was over the top helpful and always friendly. Breakfast buffet was really nice each morning and bar area in the lobby was very modern and a nice place to relax. I found the rooms to a nice size, very clean and comfortable. This hotels proximity to the convention center was a tremendous plus. Only down side was the driveway and parking costs. Certainly goes on my lists of \""go to\"" hotels when in the area."
"1","You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\n\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \n\nI will NEVER be back."
"1","My recommendation? DO NOT STAY HERE if you have a choice. Depressing atmosphere and the staff is predominantly untrained and non-English-speaking. Room service extraordinarily expensive, e.g., $14 plus $6 delivery fee plus 21% mandatory gratuity for a bowl of oatmeal which would then cost about $24 without a glass of juice or even an egg! To add insult to injury, the only restaurant  in the hotel sucks. No ambiance and food is inferior and unhealthy. No concierge. If you need to take a cab to find a meal, the hotel bilks you on taxicabs. When doorman got  us a cab, it cost $7 plus a tip. For the same ride back to this awful hotel it was only $4 plus tip, without the hotel's ASS-istance!! The Hilton would probably have been better or perhaps ANY of the other hotels. Only reason I gave it two stars is because the gym and locker room were fine."
"1","Don't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler. The Internet is awful and they don't support iPhone or iPad \n\nSo many better options around"
"1","I stayed three nights at the Westin with a group for a conference. The staff was courteous in all of my interactions with them, which were few.  The room was tiny for the amount of money that we were paying, but it was clean. \n\nI was a bit upset that their website advertised in-room refrigerators, but the only fridge was the mini-bar which required a hotel staffer to open (and which was labelled as being 'not for guest items'). Having specific dietary requirements, I had planned on using the fridge to purchase small items that i could snack on during the conference that I was attending.  \n\nI was also extremely upset at the cost of the dining options at the Westin, as well as the charges for *every* service that they offered.  This hotel was a bit of a splurge for me, even sharing it with some friends.  Two cups of coffee per room per day, extras can be purchased.  Internet (slow!) only available in the lobby, in-room you have to pay for it.  Ridiculous charges for room service, and the cost of the food itself was astronomical!  NINE DOLLARS for a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, or $20 if you wanted the breakfast buffet.  I would have been happy to pay $10-$15 for the breakfast bar, but $20 is way too much even for a 'resort' hotel.  \n\nNext time a conference I'm attending is in Charlotte, I'll be looking at other properties in close proximity to the conference center or staying further out and riding the train in."
"2","I was impressed with this place. Though busy for a wedding, they said they had open rooms on the top floor and were happy to move me \""for a better view.\"" Well done! I had a beautiful, large room on one of the top floors with a city view. Very clean, spacious, with a ridiculously comfortable bed and muscle-melting shower. Paying for internet did kind of suck. Parking garage was a bit confusing. But small details. I was passing through on a long drive and I was able to rest and relax quite nicely here. If I had the extra time, I would've stayed another day. The staff was always courteous. The following morning, one of the follow guests suffered a seizure on the hotel lobby and the matter was handled quite calmly and professionally by the staff. Kudos all around!"
"1","This hotel is so swanky! It looks so cool outside with their chic building design, concierge service, and a lot of the amenities you'd expect from such an establishment. So why the low rating? I'll elaborate!\n\nThe positives? My room on the 25th floor had a pretty cool view. The beds are super comfy and fluffy. The rest of the room is just okay. The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast.\n\nHere's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour. So preoccupied with his little computer screen he was that he didn't even look at me and waved me off with a we don't validate parking here, pay the machine on your way out. Seriously? I know I look a bit young and my clothes were kinda grungy when I left but the housekeeping when I first got here was nicer to me than you were. At least she made sure I got to where I was going when I was looking a bit lost.\n\nSo I ended up paying the parking fee of $7, but I think I'll be heading to the Ritz Carlton in the future where I'm sure they'll at least treat me with some modicum of respect instead of treating me like I came in off the street begging for some change."
"2","Stayed here for about 3 days since there was a conference going on.\n\nI would say it is in a pretty nice location.  Located at the end of Uptown (?), I did walk up Tryon and College St. a bit to check out the rest of the Uptown area, and it was no more than 10-15 minutes walking to the different restaurants.\n\nFor a Westin, it is one of the newer ones I've been to.  Westin really knows how to design their lobby and create a spacious setting.  The lobby is relaxed and oddly welcoming, which you can't really say about a lot of hotels.\n\nThe staff was courteous and we checked in with no problem.  The rooms were a nice surprise as it is fairly spacious.  All the usual amenities are there, such as internet, LCD TV etc, and who doesn't love the Heavenly bed and the shower heads??  Although one thing I didn't like was definitely the lack of a mini-fridge.  They only had the mini-bar fridge and you have to request a key to unlock it.  Even after you do unlock it, there's no room for you to put anything there, and I was too afraid of getting charged if anything was moved.\n\nInternet does cost around $13 a night, which is fairly high, but at this point, I've accepted the charges for internet is an expense I will be paying.\n\nThe gym at this Westin is amazing.  The gym is connected to the pool with a \""refresh area\"" after you swim.  The gym itself is quite big, especially for hotel standards!  Bikes, elliptical, plenty of treadmills, and a few weight-training machines.  All the cardio machines have their own TV and if you have your headphones, you can just plug it in.  Even if you don't have headphones, they have disposable headphones there that you can use for free!  They also provide fresh towels, as well as water dispensers.  I definitely took advantage of the gym while I stayed there.\n\nAs for the conference space, it does a pretty good job, with plenty of meeting rooms and ballrooms.  Of course, the conference i was attending only had several hundred of people, which isn't that big for a conference.  Caterting was done right near the escalators.\n\nI didn't eat the restaurants on location since most of the meals were taken care of by the conference but I did check it price... and I would definitely venture out and explore the city a bit.  For the same price, I could probably check out a nice steakhouse around the area.\n\nWould definitely try to stay here again next time if I'm able to visit Charlotte again!"
"1","I've been to better Sheratons and what hotel sends staff to knock on the door at 8:30pm telling me that I'm playing my banjo too loudly.  Never happened before and I'm in the thick of bluegrass country."
"2","Hubby and I like to hang out in Charlotte on the weekends, and this is definately a great hotel. If you want to relax - it is suitable, but if you want to people watch and have a great drink - the lounge works too! \n\nThe rooms are always the same -  clean, cool and with a descent view of the Queen City! I have called ahead, and booked through the reservations line - and this is the only complaint I have. \n\nOne time I visited, they did not have my reservation on file. The front desk obviously does not share the information that the main booking line has. They had actually reserved a room in Columbia, SC in error - then charged us for not showing up !? \n\nEverything was resolved a week later so we got over it! \n\nAlso, if you stop in the bar on the way out, or just chill down there to enjoy the view -- you just might run into a celebrity. I refuse to name drop, but we have spotted a couple of celebrities there, and they are usually pretty friendly !"
"2","Beautiful view from the room and the BATHROOM !!!!\nStaff was very helpful, Rooms clean - Embers restaurant food good but limited menu. \nAll week the ice machine on floor 23 and 24 did not work. Called front desk but problem was never fixed - the whole week. Also they working on the pool deck area so we could not go out and relax on the deck on some of the most awesome sunny days.\n\nThe maids did and awesome job every day !"
"2","I love Starwood brand hotels.  This Westin is a very well run hotel.  I have stayed here several times for business. The service is excellent.  The rooms well done. The catering is outstanding.  The restaurants and bars are well done. The location is ok with a quick walk to the heart of Charlotte.  Stay here you won't be disappointed."
"2","Great location especially if in town for a Panthers games. Clean rooms, comfy beds and nice staff. Late night lounge / bar scene is pretty good as well. Been here about 10 times and I'll come back again."
"2","Great hotel. Bed was comfy, room clean and the bar relaxing. Kudos to Brian (front desk) and Jarrell at the bar - great staff! The view from our 25th floor was fantastic. Would definitely stay again!"
"1","I went to an event lasy night at the Westin Hotel,  its a yearly event that has been hosted at the westin for years.  This year was smaller than the past due I think mostly because people are not happy with the continued issues of under staffing at the bar.  It took about 30 min to get a drink, and once again they ran out of vodka.  I would think because of past experiences with this group they would be better prepared.  There was so much lost revenue, last night because I saw a lot of people including my group that just left and went elsewhere to get a drink.\n\nThe main bathroom off the lobby was one of the most disgusting I have encountered.  one stall was roped off with no toilet at all,  there was  a broken bottle in the other shattered all over the floor, no towels, and one had overflowed.  Wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion.\n\nMy recemendation is step it up Westin,  I assure you I wont be back unless you do..I hope this group considers another venue, want that wants the business, as it seems the westin is not interested.."
"1","I wanted to give it three stars because the lobby was so great, the bar and bar staff were awesome and the beds were comfortable enough. But for the rate that we paid the cleanliness of our hotel room was unacceptable. There was a massive stain in the middle of the floor and left over beverages from the last occupants, and a stain on the comforter. Big disappointment...try the Hilton."
"2","In Charlotte for  conference.  Everyone has been incredibly nice, and helpful.  Good location. Walking distance to other hotels, shopping and dining.  Next door to Charleston Convention Center."
"1","Okay, from a distance this looks like a nice hotel. But Its definitely not worth the money. The pool is made from the same material as a shower in a mobile home. Its long(ish) and not wide, with its deepest point at 4 ft. The other half of the pool is 3 feet, so you can't swim laps unless you want to hit the bottom. The fitness center lacks a fan, so working out gets too hot. The room itself has a nice view but seriously all it is is a bed and a shower. There's nothing all that nice about this $300/night room. There is nothing included: no breakfast, no drinks, a water bottle in the room costs $4, internet for ONE device is $12/day. With that price, Id expect much much more. I feel like I should only be spending maybe $100. The only reason why they get away with this price is because its conveniently located next to the convention center. Otherwise, I will never stay at this place. They nickel and dime you everywhere you turn!"
"2","My husband and I were here for a wedding and it happened to be the same weekend as the Coke a Cola 600. So, there were a ton of people and we were always greeted with a smile and even given an early checkin and late check out. Our room had an amazing view of downtown, but I did notice that the comforter was not clean. I'm hoping it was a coffee stain. Minus that everything was up to par and would live to stay here again."
"2","I am only giving them a 5 because of the service I received.  I have stayed here before and the rooms are always great and this time I unfortunately got a room that must have had a party in it.  Stains on the carpet and the walls were damaged and marked up."
"2","So I've stayed at this hotel several times now.  I really enjoy the convenient location to the light rail.  There are several good local spots to eat at just off the light rail's route.  The breakfast Buffett in the lobby is expensive, but pretty good.  I've had drinks at the bar down stairs, and let me tell you that you'll be paying full price for under poured cocktails.  I've never had an issue with the staff.  They've always been helpful and friendly.  They have a car service available out front, so you can roll in style, for a price.  If you have the extra cash, not a bad spot to stay."
"2","We always stay here when in Charlotte. \nI've always had a clean king room and friendly, efficient service. Full service Starbucks coffee downstairs in the lobby. The room has free Starbucks medium roast coffee, with coffee maker in your room. \nA mini fridge and safe are built into the dresser the TV sits on.\nThere's a make-up mirror, hair dryer, iron and ironing board in the room too. \nThey have a good breakfast buffet in Embers. It's a bit pricy though. \nHaving the affordable light rail (it's NOT FREE) right behind the hotel is VERY Convenient too. You won't have to take a taxi to get to the Time Warner cable arena. But if you need a ride they offer towncar service out of the hotel for a decent rate. \nThere's convention space in the hotel and the Charlotte convention center is right next door. \nBe sure to sign up for the SPG rewards so you can earn a free night at an SPG property."
"2","Great Stay During Business Travel in Sept 2013\n\nClean, modern, comfortable bed, good gym, indoor pool, two bars, a Starbucks in the lobby, and great downtown location.\n\nSide Note, the architect of this building is very cool."
"2","I am writing this after my horrible Omni experience because now I appreciate my experience here even more. The staff are great and I had a very wonderful experience. I didn't get that intrusive uncomfortable feeling like I did at the Omni. The room was very modern and their electronics were up to date including the ipod deck and the mini bar. The room was CLEAN and large just like the bathroom. And the view from the large windows was beautiful."
"2","An architectural site, this is one of the better Westin's.\n\nPros:\nGreat restaurant, food is creative and tasty\nLocation in the middle of downtown Charlotte\nGreat for the price\n\nCons:\nRooms a little bit on the smaller side\n\nOverall, a great stay"
"2","Stayed here for a week for a conference in town, and it was like home away from home. I had a very comfortable stay. Location was great. I was able to walk around the downtown area with no problem. The restaurant on the first floor was very good, and I ended up eating there almost every night. That, and also I couldn't really find other \""healthier\"" options in walking distance. The bartenders at the restaurant/bar were also very nice. One bartender in particular (and I forgot his name, sorry), on my last night of stay, gave me free drinks, which was very kind of him.  \nThe gym was clean and spacious, and also empty most of the time, which I loved. \nThe wireless internet, on the other hand, was unnecessarily expensive ($15 per day? WHY??) and slow. \nI used their room service for breakfast twice (I was feeling lazy)- also tasty and you can find \""healthier\"" options on the menu. \nTheir Starbucks in the lobby, however, was closed a lot of times, and the closest coffee place was about five blocks away, which was a bummer..\nBut all in all, if I ever make it back to Charlotte again, I would most likely stay at the Westin again."
"2","Great place. Accommodating and the staff was awesome\nI had an incident yesterday. They had some sort of rapper or hip hop artist staying in the room next to mine. They were being loud, a lot of cursing and shouting, many doors brig slammed. And this occurred in the room (which was next to mine) and in the hallway. It went on until late at night (4 am)\nI felt unsafe and not comfortable calling security. I should. Retaliation was my main concern. I expressed my discontent this morning and manager gave me the possibility if late check out, which was nice considering my flight is schedule to depart at 6 pm. All and all it was good, however I would recommend to ANY hotel that have guests that are prone to kiss behave and not obey the rules to either NOT have anyone stay in t contiguous room (or on the floor at all) or to warn them prior to checking them in."
"2","I love this hotel.  Love love love.  I stayed years ago for business and was impressed and recently stayed for a wedding weekend and was not let down.  The staff was super nice, the car service was prompt, our room was nice and the location is great.  My only complaint was the A/C in our room was acting really wacky and not coming on and the drinks at the bar (which the patio is a great area outside to relax) were kinda pricey."
"2","One word \""heavenly\"" beds. Need I say more. I'm a fan of Westin everywhere I travel. The beds alone make it a good stay. This location is ideal, right in the city center. Walking distance from EpiCenter and far enough away from the noise.\n\nThis Westin was as expected. The staff were friendly, but as another yelper stated. They didn't go out of there way. Being a SPG gold member, we were put in a superior king room. The view of the city was amazing from the room."
"2","Need a place in Charlotte to get black out drunk without fear of waking up missing vital organs? Than the Westin Charlotte is the place for you. Was witness to an amateur drunk who passed out. Rather than doing the typical bounce and toss the staff gave genuine care and concern to the help him through the this moment of self reflection. One employee went so far as to ice his neck in hope to help him sober up, if nothing else at least remeber his name. Even when the EMTs arrived and drunk punches were thrown the staff stood stoically ready to show their support for their customer. So, it became a dinner and a show. Five stars.  NERD RAGE!"
"2","A beautiful hotel with accommodating staff and good amenities. The catering is splendid. The food is fresh and REALLY good! I don't need to say anymore than what has been said about the beds. Just the best there is. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Charlotte's beauty can be seen out my window. Stay here!"
"1","I can only speak from the experience of staying here for a recent convention. Several conferees and I had issues with the staff during the event over displays and services. Due to the nature of the event (romance novelists and readers) I got the impression they hovered close in case we decided to cause trouble. I did not find the venue pleasant.\n\nWhile my room was clean, I think the bed aggravated my back pain. I also understand a number of conferees who drank the water experienced discomfort and sore throats."
"2","Great location for someone new to the city. Your right in the middle of it all! Within walking distance of Charlotte's great bars & restaurants. The staff was very accommodating."
"1","Ehhhh...not so much.\n\nWhile the building, level of service, and rooms were in line with a typical Holiday Inn, the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and Priority Club customer.\n\nBrief summary of my horror story - \nWe check in, we get the wrong room.  They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.\n\nWe get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.\n\nDespite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110 / night room.\n\nFurthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.\n\nWhen I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.\n\nThe next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.\n\nAfter dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.\n\nUltimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  \n\nAlso, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.\n\nThat is all."
"1","The Good:\nThis place is in a pretty prime location downtown as it is located to some of the best eateries downtown (Merts, Pita Pit), a few blocks from Bobcat Arena, walking distance to Bank of America Stadium, and a stones throw from the heart of Charlotte (Trade/Tryon).  \n\nThe room had an ipod dock which was a nice touch.\n\nThey seem to operate on the honor system when it comes to receiving more room keys.  I stumbled downstairs at about 2:30 in the morning, asked what room my party was staying in and was promptly given a room key.\n\nCollege St. turns into a ghost town at about 2:30 at night, so it is very easy to make your way back to the hotel from the Buckhead Saloon, which if situated anywhere else would be an inadvertent vehicular manslaughter waiting to happen.\n\nThe Bad:\nSee Austin J's review regarding payment policy and competency of front desk.  At least worth -2 stars.\n\nTheir televisions could be called outdated... at best.  I am fairly confident that their analog tv's will go the way of the dinosaurs when the changeover happens next year.\n\nThe beds.  This is not 18th century America. People no longer reach maximum biological size at 5'8 160 pounds.  Don't advertise a room as comfortably accommodating four when it would be a snug fit for the cast of Little People Big World.\n\n3 years ago I was charged $80 dollars for a flower pot that I ALLEGEDLY broke."
"1","This is the second time that my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.  Both experiences have been terrible.  The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15/day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.  I would strongly recommend staying at one of Charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience."
"2","This was one of my favorite hotels I have stayed at...mainly because of some key ingredients to making a trip great - Concierge, the room, the rest of the staff present.\n\nThe Concierge was more than happy to guide us to where great places to hangout and party were. He not only directed us, but gave us comp (free admission) cards to more places than we could possibly go in one night, leaving us with many options. In just the bar, and club that we actually did go to he saved us over $30 in just cover costs. BOOM!\n\nThe room was large and spacious, the gentleman who checked us in at the front desk was more than accommodating by putting us in a king room. Great bed and great view. Lots of TV channels and free wi-fi. Couldn't ask for more! \n\nThe hotel staff was incredibly warm, and welcoming...Everyone. I mean it! The valet, the front desk people, the Concierge, and even one of the managers. They really, really took care of us and I am thankful for that!\n\nWhy no fifth star? This place really needs to figure out the PARKING ISSUE...It is a $15 a night to park, which is not a huge deal when you are in a great location but what a pain in the ass to get there! Once you park your car you go down an elevator, then walk about 200 feet to the entrance to the hotel, then walk another 200 feet to another set of elevators up to your room then walk another x amount of feet to your room. Not convenient at all! There should be a way to go from the garage to your room, or something to that effect. Or charge less for parking!\n\nOverall, I'd stay there again - great experience!"
"2","Recently stayed at this Holiday Inn location for a business trip and was pretty happy with it.  The location is great and the room was pretty comfortable.  Free Wi-Fi is very nice since so many hotels now charge you a fee.  It was walking distance to many restaurants and pretty much in the middle of everything.  If I were to come for a personal trip, I would probably still stay here if the price is reasonable."
"1","I stay in 3 to 4 hotel rooms a week so I am not too picky when it comes to beds but these were terrible. If I'm going to pay $160/night I at least want a decent bed. And this may sound weird but the toilet seats were too small (and I'm a small guy). The rooms were clean but I would not stay here again."
"2","We had a great experience here:  helpful staff, clean room, comfy bed, free WIFI, and plenty of security.  My only complaint was that silly basin sink located at the entrance to the room.\n\nThis hotel is marvelously situated within walking distance to some of the best entertainment and dining in town."
"2","I hosted a bachelorette party for my sister at this location and overall everything was wonderful. There were a few customer service issues I had that I'd like to mention so that others are aware. \n\n1- I booked the block of rooms 3 months in advance via the 1-800 number on the website. I have a military ID and requested the military discount. I was given the discounted rate for all 5 rooms and was told I only needed to present my ID upon arrival. Unfortunately, when I arrived the girl at the check-in counter told me that I could not have all 5 rooms at the discounted rate, that I could only have two of them. I pitched a royal fit and 40 minutes later they gave me all 5 rooms at the rate that I was quoted. Bad way to start a fun occasion.\n\n2- I emailed back and forth with Tracy Bernstein about specifics that I needed for this gathering I was hosting (iPod player, Microwave, Fridge, Early Check-in). I was told these things would be ready and they were not. We never got the iPod player, Microwave or Fridge. Bad customer service, Tracy.\n\nNOW, I'd like to tell you about the wonderful things at Holiday Inn City Center. \n\n1- Very clean and modern. I loved the decor and it made great back drops for my photography.\n\n2- The rooms had adjoining doors which made it very easy for our guests to mingle.\n\n3- Jay Jay at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. He arranged a private limo service for us beautiful ladies for a great price. I've been told he has the \""hookup\"" so make sure you get with him if you need anything special. \n\n4- Adam is the food and beverage manager and he was so good to me. He offered to bring a 6 foot table in to our room with table cloths for FREE. Are you serious? FREE? He even came by the room to make sure we got all that I requested and warn us about the no noise policy starting at 11pm. We very happily toned it down by that point. \n\nThe stay at the hotel was wonderful and the event was great. I really appreciate all that helped me at the hotel to make this event special!"
"1","AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!"
"1","We had a series of misfortunate events take place from the moment we arrived, all the way through to the time we left.  It's actually quite sad because I'd like to share the information, but I'd rather lick dog poop off the bottom of my shoe than waste another moment of my life on this place.  It's awful and we won't be going back.  The worst of our experience?  Let's just say that the hotel employee who used his master access to open up our room, while we were in it, with the privacy sign on, pretty much sealed the deal here.  If anyone's had theft problems, this may be why.  Hotel staff was quick to throw out \""sorry\"" for each thing that went wrong, but we strongly suspect nobody meant what they said. (I didn't want to give this place any stars, but one star is needed to submit this review...)"
"1","Steer clear of this hotel.  Mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses. Bar is way overpriced.  There are MANY choices in Charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one."
"1","Beware of this hotel...  Under renovations until December 30, 2014.  New RF ID keys and I have had to get a new key 3 days in a row!  \n\nThe middle elevator has been known to get stuck or doors not even opening....  Things to just be aware of!"
"2","Went here yesterday to experience what it's like in an indoor waterpark. Overall it was nice except everyone had to exit the water not once but TWICE. Let's just say not everyone swimming doesn't have bladder control. Anyways, food/snacks are surprisingly cheap with a decent menu. Can't imagine what it's like in the summer. Admission is cheap to (especially if you're a county resident)."
"1","We went on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We all had a wonderful time until the end. We were in the womens locker room and even though they had a family locker room there were little boys there about 6-7 years old changing in the room too and one walking around with no clothes on. I had my little sister and did not appreciate it at all. When I talked to staff all they asked me was if they had autism? It doesnt chnge anything.Come on there was a family bathroom right there. And they didn't seem too concerned about my complaint. And the bathrooms were nasty. But if you don't use the locker rooms or bathrooms it is good."
"2","Visiting out if state. Needed something to do on short notice due to bad weather. My daughter (6) had much fun. Not tall enough for the big slide (48\""), but she was not fazed.\n\nThe accommodations in the shower/bathroom left something to be desired, e.g. hooks in the shower stalls, perhaps locks to rent for the lockers? but it was nice. \n\nNice staff, bathrooms were nice (until a jerk put swim diapers in the centrifuge for drying bathing suits), and the pool was clean (and heated). Cheap admission and snacks. We would go again if we were in town and needed something to do if the weather were to be uncooperative.\n\nGreat to see a community center like that and tax dollars put to great use. I'm envious; I wish we had something like that."
"2","As others have mentioned, it does seem a bit creepy deepy to a) review a cemetery and b) also see the categories for this location as \""Funeral Services & Cemeteries\"" AND \""Active Life.\"" However, that's a perfect description of Elmwood Cemetery. It is a stunning space of lush green grass, ancient trees and flowering bushes and home to some of the oldest resting places in Charlotte. \n\nDuring the daylight hours, this space is a breeding ground for dog walkers, joggers and pensive, respectful photographers. The winding roads are great for anyone who needs a bit of exercise and many of the gravestones are quite beautiful and interesting. Many of the folks buried here were from the same well-established (old money) families who still reside in Charlotte today. \n\nWhile it may seem odd to schedule a run in a cemetery, I promise that you won't regret it at Elmwood Cemetery. It's picturesque, interesting and, of course, quite quiet!"
"2","Great place for a bike ride. Super close to uptown. Could definitely bring a bottle of wine and make it a picnic with the use of a little discretion."
"2","This is a nice place with ample amount of space to study, read, or just play around on the internet.  The establishment is full of great books, probably the biggest selection that I have seen since being a student at Appalachian State University.  If there is a line for the computers they only give you an hour to be online, but this is usually not a problem.  Everyone keeps pretty quiet and I would recommend it for studying or an afternoon read."
"1","Full o' bums....er...the less fortunate...who camp out inside to either sleep or use the restrooms to bathe in. Plenty of other sketchy people who don't look like they're there to read. If perverts had a chip implanted in them, the device used to find them might target this location as Ground Zero from what I've heard horror-story wise from others.\n\nToo many floors for a library but a decent selection.  I only care for this one since it's so close by my work. I do all of my lending online and have my book ready and waiting for me when it's available near the front counter so I don't have to venture too far inside.\n\nFor others, you would have to contend with finding parking or riding public transportation. \n\nNot really worth it.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"2","This is my first time visiting Charlotte. ( A three-month stay) I was very surprised that 51 books I may read are in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Library system. True enough, someone from Los Angeles (like myself), New York or Boston would not be completely delighted with the range of subject matter, you can find something. Upon entry and departure, I enjoyed reading the quotes on the pillars. Happy hunting!\n\np.s. A word of caution, bring a sturdy bag from home to carry your books. The library hasn't designed their own bags and give those flimsy ones from the grocery store.\n\nThis location is closed Sundays and Mondays during the summer."
"2","I use the MAC for lap swims.  They have 6, 7 & 13 foot lanes.  There are plenty of lanes and over a month of going there I haven't had to share a lane once but even if one did have to share, they are generous lanes with good marking on the flooring.  The water is cool; perfect for a workout but if one wanted there is a smaller warm pool as well. \n\nThe great thing is that you can pay $5 as a county resident for single visits.  It's only a few dollars more for non-residents so if you are visiting from out of town and want to keep your training going, stay at the Hampton or the Hilton for easy access to the MAC.\n\nI have to admit that the facility is old.  The locker rooms are grimy and dirty with old fixtures but there are plenty of lockers, showers, stalls and spacious to change out.  The number and size of lanes makes up for the small amount of time you spend in the locker room and outside of the pool."
"2","Finally, we found a place that has everything we want! A relatively shallow pool so I can practice my not-so-good backstroke, a deep pool to swim laps and get that water cardio, a cool water pool with 6-8 lanes, a heated pool, and best of all, an adult-only HOT TUB!!\n\nThe pool itself is really clean and the water is very clear. There were plenty of lifeguards around, and a group practicing scuba diving on one side. The warm shallow pool had a couple instructors giving swim lessons. I particularly liked having so many windows through which I could watch the rain pour while I happily swam in my heated pool and some cool artwork around the big pool. The hot tub is really nice. At first, coming from the cool water pool it felt too hot, but as my body got used to it, it felt great. They also have a fitness center which we did not try.\n\nThe locker rooms are pretty decent for a public pool. They were clean, had plenty of lockers, hair dryers, and a tiny dryer for swim wear, which I absolutely LOVED.\nIt costs $5 for adults if you are a resident of CharMeck and a family membership is $53 a month, $48 if you choose to draft."
"1","I like to think of myself as an appreciater of art.  I've loved the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago, The National Gallery in London, and, of course, the Smithsonian in DC.  Upon moving to Charlotte, we decided to visit the Museum of Crap + Design (er, Craft + Design) one afternoon (it's free between certain hours on Tuesdays) to check it out.   We quickly breezed our way through it, as what we saw were mostly sticks and twigs stuck into things.  It was not impressive by any means and not \""art\"" in my book.  I'll stick to Charlotte's Mint Museum of Art if I want to see something artsy."
"2","I'm a big fan of the Mint Museum of Craft + Design. Their exhibits always feature beautiful works. I really liked \""Possibilities: Rising Stars of Contemporary Craft in North Carolina\"" in the summer. Like Mindy W., I particularly liked the work of Anne Lemanski. Her art involves three-D constructions of animals using politically charged images. Right now, there is also an avant-garde jewelry exhibition at the museum.\n\nIf you're new in town, appreciate art and are looking to meet people, I'd recommend checking out the Young Affiliates of the Mint. It's a social group for young Mint supporters. They have fun parties and monthly happy hours on the roof of the Mint. It's a great venue because you're in the middle of Uptown's skylines and have a really unique view of the city."
"1","My daughter will be leaving Queens after this spring.  I feel like we were duped.  \n\nThe school is a publicity machine with nothing behind it.  The students have no sense of community, and the neighbors hate them.  My daughter has had terrible things said and shouted at her by the supposedly \""charming\"" upscale people with their \""beautiful\"" homes.  The neighbors hate the school and take it out on students.\n\nThe school does not care about students once they have enrolled.  They nickel and dime them for every little thing.  There is no social life on the campus or near the campus.  \n\nMy daughter says that the morale of the teachers is awful.   Two have talked about what they make and how it is insufficient.\n\nMy daughter has older friends who did well on their SATs and had good grades and cant get into graduate school.  There is no network to help with jobs, except maybe nursing.\n\nDont send your child to Queens."
"2","I received my BA some time ago and was poised and ready to go to grad school to pursue a career in academia, either Literature or Creative Writing, but then life happened and fast forward seven years and I had a ton of work experience and traveled abroad but was still missing something in professional life.  So I started hunting for jobs and kept running into the same problem--all of them required an MBA.\n\nNowadays, an MBA is what a BA was 10-20 years ago.  It's kind of the standard now.  To even be considered, you have to have this degree, so then I set out about finding a place that wouldn't only give me classes but give me the intangibles that set exceptional people apart from the rest.\n\nSo I looked at Wake Forest, and I looked at UNCC, and I looked at Chapel Hill and found the same trend--they showed me all the bells and whistles of their program (the updated technology, the facts and figures about success rates, the name dropping you could do), but none of those programs really had substance.  I'd take some classes, learn enough to get good grades, and I'm done.\n\nWhen I visited Queens, not only did Dean Shiffler present the school in a positive light (which is expected), one of the current students did.  Unsolicited.  I was walking around the grounds, struck up a conversation, they were in the program I was interested in, and he gave me the run-down.  It was an honest assessment, and that meant more to me than anything else.\n\nI'm in my second year now in the PMBA program, and I'll tell you this--I will never regret this decision.  I still have a ways to go, but I've learned more than just finance and stocks and bonds and amortization and cost/benefit analyses and all the other information you'll learn in an MBA program.  I've learned about myself.  I've discovered that my vision for my professional path was almost non-existent and I was at a point in my life where I was going nowhere fast.  They truly invest in you here.  It's a small school, which is just what you need.  It's competitive, but rewarding.  Students really build a community here.  You're not just a number--professors remember you by name (or at least face), they're accessible, they listen, and most importantly, they approach their jobs as a person first, and a \""Dr\"" second.  \n\nI'd be willing to speak to anyone about the PMBA program at Queens; I have learned some invaluable lessons already as a result.  Aside from the beautiful campus, you get a sense of belonging here--Southern charm at it's best.  I'm really proud to be a (graduate) Royal, and you should definitely consider Queens."
"2","THE BEST place to get coffee in Charlotte!  Clay, Phoebe and the rest of the staff will do their best to make you welcome!"
"1","Facility OK.  Shipping is horrible.  Bring on the Brown.  While the place is OK for copies and such,  Fedex shipping is worse than the post office.  Slow and often laden with problems.  UPS from now own"
"1","I had an absolutely horrible experience today at this location.  I brought in 2 reams of multicolored neon documents that I had already printed and needed to be cut into 6 panels.  I dropped off the documents around noon and was promised the cuts to be completed by 4:30.  I arrived at 4:30 to find that 30% of the panels I needed cut out were ruined.  Completely cut through the printed area because the employee had mistakenly turned the first few sheets around the wrong direction so the rest of the ream was cut beyond correction.\n\nThey offered to reprint and use their own paper and claimed it was the same multi-color neon that I had purchased at office max for $30.  It turned out all of the colors were different and their prints all came out different sizes and were cropped horrible.  When I explained to the manager that the paper color was different from what I had purchased and the cuts were terrible, she blamed my printer for being inconsistent.\n\nGuess what, all of the prints they made and cut were equally, if not worse than the ones I printed.  Bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work.\n\nThe woman who did the original cuts and made the mistake when home in the middle of the debacle and turned over the corrections to a nice young worker who was 'in training' according to his badge.\n\nHe spent the next 2.5 hours while I waited trying to reprint and recut the pages to correct the mistake but unfortunately he was not able to get the size and cuts consistent.  I ended up asking him to just print full pages and I had to buy a paper cutter and manually cut all of them so in addition to wasting about 3 hours in their store, I now had to spend another 50 dollar and spend the evening cutting them manually.\n\nManagement refused to give me the badly cut and ruin documents free of charge and instead charged me 50% of the original price.  Shame on me for even accepting this as the service from the manager was horrible and the quality of product I received was even worse.  \n\nThe ONLY redeeming part of my terrible experience was the gentleman who tried to fix the botched job.  He was patient and really cared to try and fix the pathetic job by the other employee.  He reprinted and recut and reprinted and recut, but unfortunately I just don't think he had the necessary training to really handle the job, which is obviously another reflection on management as he was basically doing most of work alone there this evening.   I hope one day this guy get promoted to management and actually cares about making customers happy.  As for the others...i think its time to find another career that is not in service oriented company.\n\n\nGo here if you don't care about quality products where employees care about delivering the products they offer instead of just giving up and going home.\n\nThanks for nothing!"
"2","Time Warner over AT&T any day of the year..."
"1","All I can say is that A) I had no other option then to go with Time Warner Cable for my internet service \n\nand B....\n\nIf you don't have a local number it will be an absolute NIGHTMARE to pay your bill! You can go through the ring of automated messages only to get to a live person (after 10-15 min) then be told they will charge you so you must go through the automated service ....(repeat ). I cringe when it comes time to pay my bill each month.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to avoid using them -I suggest you do so !"
"1","I was a customer for approx 16 yrs.  Only because they were my only option.  Came home one day to find out they had cut off my service because I had a balance of $28.00.  It was gonna be $150 and 2 wks before I could get it turned back on.  Needless, to say I told them to bite me and welcomed DirecTV which I love. !!!"
"1","Time Warner Cable is awful.  I really recommend looking elsewhere for your cable/internet before choosing them.\nI have had nothing but issues with my cable and internet since I had them, which has been about 3 years.  My internet will be slow for no reason atleast once a week, my cable will freeze and I will have to restart my box...which is annoying when you are trying to watch tv.\n\nAlso, they really have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I recieved a bill from them a YEAR AND HALF after the fact for 35 bucks.  The best part is, I do not even have time warner in my name anymore....when I asked why I got this bill so late, they told me that since I moved they no longer had a \""bill to\"" address.\n\nhmm, very odd that no other companies had any issues with sending mail to my new address.  Its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone? Would that have been so difficult? I dont think so.\n\nI called them up to discuss his and ask them these questions and the person I spoke to was dumbfounded.  Yea, I would be to.....because it makes NO SENSE TO BILL SOMEONE A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE THE BILL IS WHEN IT IS SENT TO THEM A YEAR AND A HALF LATER.\n\nDo yourself a favor, take to look into another internet/cable provider.  It is not worth the hassel or the headache."
"1","So I haven't had TWC in 3.5 years and have heard nothing from them (I live in area of SC that they don't service).  Today I get a collection notice from them for $48.  Stop spending money to name every arena in the nation and hire some people who know what they're doing."
"1","Well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try.  Well, I ended up telling them I never wanted to hear even their name again.  4wks later and I still had nothing hooked up and they cut the main cable line to my condo property and at&t's line when trying to bury some new lines for me.  They have no idea what they are doing and you get a different story each time you call them.  They better never even step foot near my door again.  Horrible !!!!"
"1","UGH!  Worst service ever!!!  We kept having issues with our wireless where it would go out sporatically so we called up TW and they sent out a service person to take a look.  First of all, they charge for the service visit because they outsource their maintenance.  Second of all, after FIVE visits (most of which were extremely late and tracked dirt into our apartment) the problem was still not rectified.  They tried to charge us for a new modem because they said that would fix the problem, and when it didn't, it took forever for them to pay me back for the modem we weren't using.\n\nJust switched to ATT U-Verse and it's cheaper, better, and they don't call every month to see if I want to add services."
"1","In my area, I have my choice of Time Warner, Windstream & DirectTV. I went with Time Warner many years ago because of the fabulous bundle pricing (basic cable DVR & high speed internet, only). Unfortunately, like almost everything else, they reward you so well as a new customer, but do not offer anything for loyalty.\n\nI've been with them almost 6 years & the first few years were fine.  I was happy with a below $100 bill every month & never had any outages.  Fast forward to the past couple of years & I've had outages out of the blue, significant rate increases, locked into two different year contracts, only to have my bill stand at a whopping $141 every month.  When calling to report outages / issues, I get the run around & a \""few days out\"" scheduled appointment.  As far as trying to get a better deal on my service...I'm always told, \""there aren't any promotions available to you right now\"".\n\nBuyer's remorse? You bet."
"1","The Yelp title under 2 stars is, verbatim: \""Meh I've experienced better.\"" \n\nWhen it comes to Time Warner Cable, nothing could be further from the truth. \n\nThe Good: \n-If you can lock into an affordable contract for a number of years, you're golden. \n\n-Wireless speeds vary and I'm happy with my current download times. \n\n-Movies On Demand are current and *usually* play just fine. \n\n-I'm also a fan of the start over option, even though it's only available on select channels. \n\nThe Bad: \n-Customer service ranges from acceptable/moderately helpful to downright ridiculous. This includes obscene wait times and employees who (seemingly) have no idea a) what's going on with outages and b) have absolutely no power to rectify any problems whatsoever.\n\n-Outages happen. I get it. But have a plan in place to address them and fix them in a timely fashion when they do. TWC is not speedy. \n\n-If you do want to renew your service and pay a reasonable amount of money for internet, phone and cable (i.e. $150 or less per month), you really have to jump through hoops...and threaten ditching the service altogether.\n\n-As Angie P said - there's really no incentive to stay a loyal customer because the rates keeps increasing. I find it extraordinary and brazen that TWC automatically upcharged my bill after a few years and expects me to pay an additionally $40 per month without giving me any reason whatsoever as to why my rates are hiked. \n\nI wish I could break up with TWC, but as of now I'll just sulk over my newly negotiated monthly rate."
"1","One star reviews do not happen often for me, but I see no other option in this case. The bottom line is there is a total disconnect between their sales department and customer service.\n\nSales called me and gave me a deal that was too good to be true. However, the sucker that I am for a deal, I got it. I questioned the sales rep repeatedly to make sure that what she was offering was very clear and there were no hidden fees. Looking back, they'll tell you whatever is needed to just get you to buy in without any consequence for lying to the customer. \n\nA month later I got my bill, which was supposed to be $75-$80 and it was well over $250 (remember, too good to be true). After I picked my jaw up off the floor, I called them...and stayed on hold for an hour. After talking to customer service and finally putting in a request for a supervisor to review my call, I had to wait for a return call. Never happened. Apparently, customer service and billing have different promos or authorizations than the sales teams. This cycle of calling without a response went on for at least 3 times  and over 3 hours of waiting before I could ever get to someone who could do anything to resolve my billing issue. At the end, I assure you I was much more firm and less willing to be pushed off to the next person.\n\nThe customer service proved to me that they do not care about the customer experience, loyalty, or anything in my behalf. So, I dropped the service. *I showed them.*\n\nShame on you, Time Warner Cable."
"1","This is for Time Warner Cable as a whole:\nFOR SHAME!\n\nThe house next door is a rental. Everytime somebody moves out and has their cable disconnected, our's is disconnected too. I have to call and have it reconnected. They always want somebody to be at the home when a technician comes and I have to argue with the service rep that there is no reason for me to be at home and to do the connection at the street. Still they argue that someone has to be there. I refuse and tell them either send somebody out there or DirectTV is looking pretty promising. Boom! Done. Somebody finally comes out there when I'm not home. This last time the technician actually came back out to ask me about what's going on and he went back up the pole and labled our cables seperately to hopefully avoid an outage when somebody moves out again. I wish I got his name to give him some kudos. \n\nAlways ask for a credit for a day or two's worth whenever you have an outage.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"1","TWC IS THE WORST!\n\nUnfortunately, TWC has basically monopolized the Charlotte area.  I am very jealous of all the people who have AT&T Uverse available to them.  I have contemplated DirectTV because TWC is so awful.  Every few months the \""promotion\"" on my plan runs out and when I call they say they are giving me the best possible promotion that they usually don't give to any other customer by taking $5 off...how generous.  They really don't care if their customers are unhappy because they know they have no other choice for digital TV.  If you have other options, USE THEM!"
"1","Some of the worst service ever.  I called to cancel service and was transferred to retension.  After 53 minutes on the phone and trying to cancel service, I somehow agreed to keep the service for 6 months at a significantly reduced rate.  I then recieved  the bill the next month and the price had no change.  I called and they wrote in there notes some  othert agreement.  I asked to speak to manager and they denied me.  I told them I want my service canceled now and that I was not going to pay the bill.  They said no.  I asked for the manager he said no.  He then said if I ask for manager he will need to hang up.  He hung up.  His name is Jesus and will not give any other identification to me.  He is in the retention department.  If you are the manager of this employee, please review his work."
"1","I haven't had any problems with my internet, but man, do those customer service employees behind the counter hate their lives, or what?\n\nI came in to transfer service from my roommate's name into my name, since she was moving out. It was about 3:00 on a Monday. I was lucky enough to be first in line, but 10 or so people quickly lined up behind me while we waited. There were only 4 employees working, and one of them, after glaring up to see the forming line, left for a break, and was in no hurry to get back. \n\nI explained why I was there and presented my modem, and was informed that I would have to start a new account instead of transferring, since I didn't have written permission from my roommate. Ok, no big deal. The lady helping my was cordial, but unfriendly and bored out of her mind. She talked to the computer screen instead of to my face. After starting my new account, she watched me pack up my modem, router, and all it's cables and start to walk away, before she asked if I would like go ahead and pay the first month so I wouldn't be billed for it. Good thing my wallet was at the bottom of my purse, under all the equipment she just watched me put on top of it!\n\nI know working with the public can be trying, and no one likes Mondays, but I hope I never have problems with my service that involve a visit back to the office. Talk about unpleasant."
"1","I was offered internet sufficient to stream video for $29.99, and then when called to set up appointment to install service I asked what I would be charged and was told $34.95. I then called customer service to discuss what I would be paying and was told the $34.95. I explained that I had been quoted less, and the agent told me he could not do anything to help me. I think service providers should honor their word. I will use a carrier that is truthful and honest."
"1","Terrible customer service.  I wanted to change my services, after an hour and a half on the phone, the change I wanted was not done and I was disconnected.  Called back and was told wait time would be 30 minutes.  I gave up.  If I could cancel service on line, I would, but that is not an option.  The only way to cancel is to call their number wait forever and pray you dont get cut off.  If you are looking to subscribe look at other alternatives first.  I read somewhere that Charlotte has the highest Time Warner rates in the country.  Avoid this company if you can.  Once they have you they make it hard to escape."
"1","Let me start with the only good thing.....internet service.  Great, expensive, but dependable and fast.\n\nThis is where the honeymoon ends.\n\nThe cable tv service, especially the HD DVR service is the WORST!!!!   I cannot even begin to tell you how many movies and shows I have missed.  I have been through 8 DVR boxes and about 6-8 service visits in the past 12 months!   The \""HD\"" service is terrible, and the boxes are cheap junk, regardless of what brand they appear to be.\n\nI watch about 75% of my TV using the DVR, so its really important.  It freezes, gives you a black screen, records parts of shows/movies, refuses to play things you record, re-starts itself whenever it wants, and randomly deletes everything you have recorded!!!!   So many new shows are not on demand, so if you miss one or two, you have to watch the season next year when its on DVD or Netflix because their horrible service makes you miss them.\n\nDon't even get me started with their customer service, or lack of.  Lets just use a few words to describe without cursing......rude...un-trained...clueless...un-helpful...un-knowledgeable...just to name a few.  Hold times are ridiculous, and they always have to transfer you to someone else after making you hold for 20 minutes.  They are unresponsive and really don't care if they lose customers.\n\nI have scheduled a disconnect for tv service and gone with a dish....can't be any worse, and its way cheaper.\n\nSince they have a monopoly on cable service, your only other choice is satellite, and perhaps that is why they really don't care about losing customers."
"1","Wish I could give TWC zero stars. They have billed me wrong consistently for 4 months straight, then hit me with fees that don't make any sense. When I call to discuss, I am on hold for an average of 40 minutes. When I finally get someone on the phone, they are rarely helpful. One woman told me her manager would call me back and he never did. \n\nThe worst part is, I'm an accountant and even I can't figure out their billing system. It should be illegal the way they bill people. It doesn't help that they have a monopoly on almost all downtown apartments in the Charlotte area. I have bugged AT&T U-verse about offering in my area, so hopefully I will be able to switch soon. If you are considering moving into an apartment building that only offers TWC, I urge you to reconsider! Possible the most frustrating company I have ever interacted with."
"1","I dislike TWC.  I searched online for drop-off locations and found several; however, none of the phone numbers are in service.  I decided to drive to one of the locations only to find it doesn't exist.  I am so frustrated with trying to return this box.  If you live in the Charlotte NC area, where can I drop this darn box off to?"
"1","I am typing this as I wait on hold AGAIN for the second day in a row, I have now lost 53 minutes of my life on hold with TWC.\n\nTime Warner Cable makes me cuss and weep.  I luckily lived in an area for the past several years which had AT&T U-Verse which is AWESOME.... I never had a second of trouble with any of the services (phone, interwebz and cable for a while - but now just interwebz, with broadcast channels only trom TWC for $18/mo.).  I am moving in a few weeks to a location that does not have AT&T U-Verse, so I am forced back to TWC, NOT HAPPY.\n\nWhen you finally get a human through the voice activated maze followed by commercials for all of their services, they are generally polite and helpful, but the problem is getting a human.  After sitting on hold for approx. 20 minutes yesterday and hearing that you can \""manage appointments\"" either online or via some app 17 times, I downloaded the app and searched for the ability to manage my appointment (move day has changed, so I needed to move the install appointment for internet) and you can't actually manage anything. You can look at it, but all I managed to do was become more annoyed.  I then tried the chat function for help, when I finally connected with a person online, I hung up.  MISTAKE.  You have to call to change appointment times.  BLERGH!  Back on the phone again, voice maze, stupid ads... I finally had to get back to my life after 20 more minutes on hold and gave up for the day.  \n\nSo here I am... again... on hold... we are now at the 12 minute mark to change my appointment time.  In all of my moves, the techs have been terribly pleasant (with one exception that I got my pepper spray out for just in case - he was an odd bird), generally on time (within the window) and if you manage to get a human on the phone for support or assistance, they are always helpful and polite as well.  Since they apparently hire good people, HIRE MORE!"
"1","TWC is the worst cable company I've ever dealt with. Each time I've called for Tech Support I was on hold for at least an hour. Their only response is to unplug the box.  I'm on my 2nd DVR box in 2 months & channels go out randomly.  If you can get cable somewhere else do it!"
"1","This is my first TWC experience as I relocated from out of state.  It is by far the WORST service provider experience I've ever experienced in my life.  I had to call 3 separate times @ 30 mins each to start an account.  The first 2 times they were cancelled automatically after I called because the \""current tenant\"" in the apartment hadn't put in a turn off request yet.  No one called or emailed me, I called back to confirm and they said, \""oh you should have been called...... TWICE\""  they had to run my credit TWICE since the two calls were over 30 days apart.  The folks on the phone are incredibly rude.\n\nThe # on the self install kit (listed in 30+ places in the manual) was disconnected when you call it.\n\nI called for billing (My first bill was $36 incorrect), I got tech support, they transferred me to billing (which I selected on the auto menu), I got through to Billing, They informed me they were \""in massachussets\"" they'd have to transfer me to Charlotte, which was the # I called on my bill to begin with!\n\nABSOLUTE 100% AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  This is my only YELP review ever.  It has been so infuriating I had to take the time to warn anyone.\n\n(DIRECTV before & after TWC is a god send)."
"1","I have tried repeatedly to get this company to refund an incorrect amount charged to my mother who died.  There is no email and I have spent hours on the phone.  USE any other service if you can."
"1","I do not like this company! For years I have been forced to work with them for Internet and cable and have been consistently dissatisfied with the customer service. Inconsistent billing, poor customer service, and lies sum up this service. Can't wait for more service providers."
"1","My wife and I have always liked the cable repair personnel but the customer service has always been the biggest joke- wrong departments , dropped calls, crazy appointment problems. I'm a small businessman who has sadly come to the conclusion that large corporations that dominate a market have no incentives to provide good service,customer communication, and reasonable prices. Time Warner Cable has done a horrible job of operating in this area although I fear that   the competitors are any better. A tollfree guy told me about \""claiming\"" to have an appointment I scheduled and wanted to know who I wanted to talk to- I said whoever can help me fix my problem- he then asked what department that was and in the transfer the line went dead. Its a sorry corporation that doesn't care about customer dissatisfaction, and wasted time spent by the consumer."
"1","TWC has turned me off again! How can u deprive your paying customers of SHOWTIME???? I have to ask myself...if no more Dexter, Ray Donovan, Homeland, and Shameless, what is the point of having cable? Seriously folks. They are getting out of hand and this takes the cake. I pay i have say and i say screw them! If everyone cancelled maybe they would rethink their decision. I have nothing else to watch"
"1","This is for Time Warner as a company, not a specific location, I have only worked with them online and over the phone.  I also wish that I could provide them with ZERO STARS.  This company is the worst to deal with.  It started off with my order being processed twice due to an issue with their website.  So I chatted with an analyst to have it resolved.  She then had to call me because she said my credit card was being rejected.  After about 45 minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly.  Then the day they should have been coming out to install I found out that they changed my street address in their computer when moving from the ordering system to the installation ordering system.  Therefore they installer never made it to my apartment.  When I noticed the change on the emails I received I called immediately (about 15 minutes after my scheduled install window).  The woman on the phone told me that she corrected it and contacted the driver who confirmed the new address and would still be coming.  After waiting another 2 hours with no contact I called back and the new person told me that it isn't possible to just update an address and that she had to put in a whole new order.  Oh and my specific apartment unit was not in there system so they would have to send someone out to survey before the installation so I couldn't set up another installation for almost 2 weeks.  (Mind you they had every other apartment in my building and when I originally placed the order they had no problem finding my address and signing me up)  The analyst also submitted an escalation about my issue so I could speak with a supervisor (after waiting for one for about a half an hour on the phone) within 24 hours.  Waited the whole day and no call back.  So I chatted online again and was told the escalation process takes 2-3 days not 24 hours.  I then said I just wanted to cancel any pending orders that I had in the system, to which I was told I had to call in to do.  Ok so I try to call after being hung up on by their system twice, hung up on once by a person, transferred and being on hold and trying to get through for almost a hour I finally get through to someone (nearly in tears to just end the process at this point) she asks if there is anything she can do to keep my business, I go through everything I have been through and she says \""I have gone ahead and cancelled your order\"" nothing else.  So of course I am not surprised when I look at my credit card bill and they have charged me.  So here I go again...try chatting online and they tell me they can send a check, I say I want my credit card charged back, and they tell me I have to call a local office.  But I placed the order online, then I am on hold again.  Their response \""I can submit an escalation and you will hear back from someone in 2-3 days\"".  I'm done I throw in the towel trying to deal with them.  I submitted a dispute through my credit card company and hope they can get through to them.  I am now using Clearwire.  Took me 2 minutes to place the order online, it was overnighted to me, 2 minutes to plug in and log on.  Why didn't I go with them first??  I WILL NEVER USE TIMEWARNER CABLE.  I would go without internet before I use them."
"1","Well, I never thought I would be writing a 1-star review for anything, anywhere, at any time in the present century. However, I'm MORE than happy to give the lowest rating for this location/company/provider that is humanly possible due to the sheer lack of......anything and everything. \n\nHere's my story: Simplicity until the need to cancel service came around. Shouldn't be too hard of a task, yeah? WRONG. \n\nI call, speak with the first depressing voice on the other end of the phone, and then I'm transferred to some other \""department.\"" (5 minutes on hold)\n\n \""Hello, this is aosidfh;qwoeifasdf;qlweirfg;aoid. How can I help you today?\"" I repeat my need to cancel service.\n\n *Computer clicking in the distance* accompanied by a LONG pause. (4 minutes of this).\n\n\""Ok, sir. I'll transfer you to a;sldkfjq;owifa in the uralfj*($(&%*$(#(# department.\"" \nMe: \""But all I need to do is cancel my service and give you a forwarding address for my last bill.\"" (5 minutes on hold)..................still transferred.\n\n\""Hello, sir. This is !@#$%QWEF. How can I help you today?\""\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME. ALL I NEED TO DO IS CANCEL MY SERVICE.\n\n3rd person, on the phone for another 12 minutes....I've lost my mind at this point. For shorthand math, that's 25 minutes on the phone. At this point in time, I'm just praying I don't get disconnected. She FINALLY comes back and asks for my forwarding address, of which I have to repeat no less than 5 times to her. \n\nMe: \""Ok. Just to clarify -- My service is cancelled, correct?\""\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \""Yes.\""\nMe: \""You have my forwarding address for my last bill, correct?\""\nLess-than-able TWC Employee: \""Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\""\n\n......\""help?\"" I was almost insulted that she used that as a descriptor. \""Help\"" isn't something that TWC provides. They provide song and dance and circumvention as opposed to service. \n\nThe story doesn't end there. I had to go to this location on Morehead to return the modem we rented. BAD IDEA. It's the saddest place on earth. They opened the doors at 8am and the one woman behind the counter had a small line of \""eager\"" customers. She barely paid any mind to anyone and then said, with little to no interest, \""Can I help who's next?\"" Then, randomly, she just left and started bringing boxes in to the room one by one.....WHY? Nobody knows. \n\nI got to the counter, returned the modem as swiftly as possible to the rather sad employees, and hastily left the non-existent customer service clubhouse TWC runs there. It was unreal. The whole experience, from start to finish, was the most agonizing exchange I've ever had to go through. Completely malarkey.  \n\nMoral of the story: If you want to do \""business\"" with TWC, beware."
"1","I vote Time Warner Cable the worst company of all times. I spent 30 minutes on hold tonight trying to find out why my bill has gone from 29.99 to 55.00 per month and I can not see any change in the quality of service. Their website will only allow me to increase my cost but offers no suggestions as to how I might save money. I guess no one has ever told their management that it is cheaper to keep a customer than to try and get them back. Don't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies. I love American Express they are the best company in America. Uverse is the second worst company in America in my humble opinion. Tmobile is 3rd worst company and Direct TV is the 4th worst. After that I would say Sprint is the 5th worst. By the way I have Dish for my TV and have been pleased for the most part with their service.  If you have other ideas please add."
"1","TW raised my internet rates twice in 18 months and called it \""a discount\"", WTF.  \n\nWhen it runs it's super fast (33m) but the connection is erratic. Customer service is typical for telecoms and the installation was sloppy. \n\nThe only reason I have to give them two stars is because I was stuck for years with Comcast and that was MUCH worse."
"1","After years of outages, poor quality video, service disruptions, and crappy customer service, I finally decided to switch to AT&T.\n\nLet me tell you, I've never had a WORSE experience with ANY company than TWC as I tried to get my service disconnected. I called in 2 full weeks ahead of my requested disconnection date, just to make sure everything would go smoothly. After holding for an hour, I finally talked to a lady who scheduled the disconnect, gave me a confirmation number, and everything. We went to return the equipment at the local TWC office; waited in line over an hour to turn in the equipment. \n\n2 weeks later, I check the internet - they still don't show my service disconnected. I get on line with a chat agent at TWC, and he says I'll have to call and they have no record of me disconnecting. I got very upset at the thought of calling and holding for another hour to talk to someone so I really let him have it. He then agreed to disconnect me as of 9/6, like it was some sort of favor to me. Never mind the fact that I even had the cancellation number from the phone call. \n\nSo today I look online again, and they show that I owe them $25. Actually, they owe ME $25 for the week of service I paid for and hadn't used. So, I get online again, and guess what? the chat agent that I talked to 2 weeks ago didn't set my disconnect for the original date. Instead he did it 2 weeks after! \n\nSo I got online with another chat agent today who once again apologized and is \""escalating my case\"". I've now spent over 6 hours trying to help the incompetent CSR's at TWC to actually do this correctly. Meanwhile, we've had AT&T now for over a month. Guess what? Not a SINGLE outage, not a single disruption. And customer service is prompt and helpful. \n\nI will never, ever sign up for TWC again. I don't care if I have to go without TV someday vs. paying TWC another cent. They should be a Harvard case study on how to run your business in such an incompetent, offensive way that you actually lose customers for life. I guess if they don't do it right this time, I will just pay the $25 (so they don't do something to mess up my credit) and then file a complaint with the State utilities commission. \n\nAvoid TWC. Not worth the money you will pay, and certainly not worth the pain you will experience if you ever need to contact them for anything. Worst customer service of any business I've ever dealt with."
"1","After Time Warner Cable raised my internet rates again with no improved service, I switched to EarthLink. While earthlink gave me the introductory rate, TWC who services the account, was unable or unwilling to honor it. I think I have spoken by now to 21 representatives, spend a good 5 hours on the phone, lost Internet three times because TWC turned it off; and still got overcharged by $40. They say they have it fixed now. I am not holding my breath here."
"1","I wish there were zero stars. I had TWC for several years and they were always a pain. Internet service was shoddy, they throttle speed,  they bully you into cable subscriptions to keep themselves relevant, and they just gave us a $125 unreturned equipment fee for equipment that I did in fact return. They have odd hours,  and if you move you have to physically bring the box to their office. And guess what?  No after hours drop box,  so your only option is to take time out of your work day. AT&T is much better. Avoid TWC like the plague. They'll never stop nickel and diming you."
"1","The drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous. It's as tedious as waiting at the DMV. I don't understand why Time Warner can't pick up the box, since it's required for someone to come to the house to install it. \n\nOr at least have a drop-off box! Or here's another idea- hire more than one employee in a waiting room of 50 people.\n\nStep it up Time Warner!!!"
"1","Prepare for a LONG wait, poor customer service and God forbid you have to use the restroom while you wait 30+ minutes! Unfortunately there is nothing good I can say about TW Cable. Besides the extremely poor customer service when visiting their office, the equipment they offer is outdated, to reach someone in customer service via a phone call, you are definitely going to be dealing with a mess.\n\nThe best DVR they can offer customers is a model that can only record 2 shows at a time compared to other companies that now have models that can record up to 5 shows at a time. The only reason I am with them is because they are the only provider for my home at the moment and satellite is not an option."
"1","Worse customer service ever.\nWhen I got up yesterday,  I had no information guide and could not control the volume. After being on the phone with them for SEVERAL hours, and doing everything they told me, I now have no picture, sound or anything. Before I talked to them, I could change channels and had a picture. They say the problem is with the TV, and they will send someone tomorrow, which would have been today.  They SURPRISE, did not show up, I called, the automated line asked was I calling about the account at my number, I said yes, they asked was I calling about my appointment at 3 (I called at 4), I said yes, they transferred me to someone who told me I did not have an appointment, even though the recording had just said I had, I told them I expected a credit, since I have NO service, the TV's now say no signal, before calling yesterday, I had a picture and could change channels.  I pay a lot for this \""SERVICE\"" , say they are coming tomorrow, I told them if that woman had broken my TV's with all she had me do that they WOULD be replacing them, if they cannot get my TV's up and running tomorrow."
"1","If you want crappy customer service, avoidance at all costs to FIX a problem that has been questioned for months (we have service cut outs on a daily basis-fyi we're gamers in this household we need good internet that doesn't cut out every day), and high prices...\nThen choose TWC.\n\nTWC reps do NOT READ your reports (we had a report drawn up so we could go to a senior tech). The girl who answered after we waited for 10+ minutes on hold wanted to go over the WHOLE issue with us again when it was already written out in the report had she bothered to read it.\n\nIf you want better internet, go elsewhere but let me know because I'll come with you!!\nStep it UP!!"
"1","BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, PRETTY MUCH NO CUSTOMER SERVICE \nI am so tired overpaying and dealing with this company. From messed up bills, service outages to customer service people who just do not care (yes, even hand up). \nReady to cancel right after the World Cup!"
"1","I love how they just sent me a letter to inform me about their price increase while saying I am still enjoying their special promotion.....I have been a customer for the past 7 years, not by choice, since dish and directv are so unreliable during storm season. Their dvr is old and slow compare to its counterparts. Internet connection is unstable. Safe to say, I will be looking at AT&T and Google fiber really soon."
"1","The worst place on earth. Lines are ridiculous no matter what time you arrive, customer service is deplorable and there are never enough parking spaces. This place rivals the dmv and social security office, Time Warner is a monopoly in Charlotte so it doesn't have to worry with how it treats it's customers. We normally don't have cable, but we're adding it back for football season. I am spending my day off waiting in this absurd line for a cable box so that my husband can watch the Panthers. If only we could get ESPN on our Apple TV... I can't wait until we can just stream everything"
"1","What a joke of a company. Absolutely horrible customer service and it infuriates me that I pay these rates for a product/service that continues to experience \""outages\"" and I cant even  watch the channels I want  to.  \n\nAn absolute horrible company and it upsets me every month that I pay them for \""service\"" because there is not another cable provider in my area."
"1","How can TWC even have 1.5 stars? I find it very frustrating that with over thirty people waiting, they have two (and sometimes only one) employee helping customers. There are spaces for five employees.\n\nOf course, that would require some interest on the part of TWC in providing any level of customer service. After having their service for nearly two decades, all I can say is that I feel they treat their customers solely as a source of revenue. We aren't customers to be earned. We aren't customers to keep happy. We are people for whom they provide below minimum service and in exchange we are given the privilege of paying them too much money.\n\nLike others, when Charlotte gets Google Fiber, I will leave TWC and never look back."
"1","Hahaha....I don't even know what type of review to write. Let me start off by saying I've had TW for about 4 months and cancelled my services TODAY! (And it felt awesome) I now have AT&T U-verse :) I almost never write reviews but today I will. \n\nCustomer Service: sucks! I waited and waited and waited and waited....before I actually was able to talk to someone who could assist me with ONE of my problems.\n\nBills: I recieved a $400+ bill before (and I only have one tv in my small studio apartment) needless to say my soul left my body for 10 seconds when I saw the bill...\nI'm a struggling law student, you best believe I called up customer service and \""acted a damn fool.\"" After praying to God for cussing the representatives and having my bill reduced all was well....and then....\n\nCrisis number 2 happened. Two months later I recieved another high bill of $300 plus dollars...I had enough....\n\nNeedless to say I am currently packing up TW equipment and ready to drop it off tomorrow...."
"2","Simply lovely. A lot has changed since the other reviewers ate here.\n\n1) No more tasting menu - I was dissapointed as this is why I went (and its still mentioned on the web site)\n\n2) They don't seem to be emphasizing local sourcing - on the menu there was only the mention of some local eggs for the creme brulee dessert\n\n3) Focus on lower priced dishes - I was apprehensive at the prices, they are amazingly low\n\nIn any case - dinner was delightful. Our overly friendly waiter which the rest of the table loved, did an overall great job. Everyone at the table was delighted at all the food we ordered - and we did the full on meal. From appetizers to soup to entree including sides and desserts. The waiter also recommended are a resonably priced ($50/bottle) that was excellent.\n\nAnd yes, the room itself is very charming and when we sat down I asked the host about the place and he told us all about the history of the space.\n\nAt about 8pm on a rainy Thursday night it was just us and two other tables. I hope they get more business since this is a great independent restaurant that deserves to thrive."
"1","I came to Charlotte for a business conference and was so excited about going to Ratcliffe for dinner - I'd heard great things.  I am a vegetarian and was pleasant surprised when I received a confirmation call for my reservation where the woman asked if there were any vegetarians in the group.  I said yes, and she said they would be happy to cater the menu however I wished.\n\n...which is why it was so sorely disappointing when I got to the restaurant and the waitress said they could only offer me grits, veggies or mac & cheese.  I said I'd be fine with a plate of grits with veggies, plus a side of mac & cheese.  Then 30 minutes later a different waiter brings out just a plate of vegetables for me.  I asked if there was anything beneath the veggies (thought they could possibly be covering the grits/mac&cheese) and the waiter very rudely said \""does that look like grits to you?  I told him what i'd ordered and said he had no idea what I ordered and marched off.  Then the waitress came back completely shocked and annoyed, saying she thought i'd wanted veggies...blah blah.  Eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude.  It was my first time being treated like that in an \""upscale\"" restaurant.\n\nTHEN, the host came out and asked what was wrong and all he could say when i told him was \""sorry to hear that\"", NOT \""I'm sorry about your experience\"", then he awkwardly pulled his head up until his neck turned fuschia, then walked away.  Nothing more.\n\nI got the bill for the side of mac&cheese and side of grits - they charged me $20.  I was actually trying the place out to possibly bring the rest of my company for an all-expense company dinner the next night but that definitely did not happen.  Will NEVER go back to that place again."
"1","I've been meaning to post this since my last experience there, which was late October of last year. Prior to that visit, we had eaten at Ratcliffe on 3-5 occasions, and the food had always been some of the better in Charlotte, save for a few items here and there- their chicken dishes are never very good, the mini biscuits they serve are like cold little rocks, and there is an excessive use of truffle oil going on with the grits and a few entrees (to the point that we would ask that grits not be included with our meal, the smell makes my fiance ill). But outside of that, everything had been pretty good, with generally decent service.\n\nBut then we had the October incident- after that, we never went back again. My fiance had called the day before to make a reservation and had told the host it was my birthday- we don't expect any special treatment because of this, but we'd hoped we would get a slightly better seat than what they usually gave us, which was a tiny two person table against the wall (they did it every time we went). So we arrive on our special night, and are (after the host actually showed up) escorted to the tiniest, crappiest table in the whole place, in the far back left corner next to the water station. The person that seated us was curt and unfriendly. Ok- maybe the other tables were reserved? But mind you, whenever we went, the restaurant was always under half-full, usually well under half-full- the rest of the night, I think I counted maybe 5 couples/groups in and out of the place. \n\nI can't recall if the server was male or female, I simply remember that they were not friendly, because it surprised me for the place. The dishes that night were sub-par, which was a first. Some people complain about the portion size- I don't see the problem, the food is well presented, and whenever we order the tasting course, we come out full! Anyway, the whole night, someone was always right behind my head clanking around a water pitcher, and it wasn't pleasant. Our server was slow to wait on us, and while we're used to the fact that it can take up to three hours to get out of the place (we've actually listened to tables around us complain about the slow preparation/service, to the point of anger, but we realize it takes time to artfully prepare food, so we don't have an issue with it) it was taking an exceedingly long time to be waited on. \n\nAlso, we've watched the chef come out and pleasantly make his rounds almost every time we were there, and he'd speak to almost everyone, never to us, even if he walked right by our table. \n\nIt was a miserable birthday dinner-  bad seat, bad service, and less than stellar food made quite the impression on the boy and I, and we never went back again. It just isn't worth the cost- if we're going to spend over $100 on a meal, we expect it to be much better than that, especially on a special occasion.\n\nWe are always polite and cheerful, well dressed (no jeans and such!), and we're well-educated in local/organic/gourmet food. I have zero clue as to why we would be treated poorly and stuffed into small tables- we're young, 24/25, maybe that's it. I was wearing a vintage fur coat my Dad had given me for my birthday that day, maybe the fur thing irked them. Maybe it's because we rarely order wine, as we don't care to drink. I honestly have no clue!  But it left a bad taste, and we have since found better restaurants to give our regular business to."
"2","I recently had lunch with a colleague at Ratcliffe on the Green. It a business lunch and I usually don't note things like the building and decor, but in this case it was unavoidable. The decor and service were impeccable. The service had that nice balance of friendliness and professionalism. They were always available and addressed out needs, but I never saw them hovering about. My colleague is a regular there, so we were greeted warmly and our greeter (who happened to also be an active local judge???) shared with us some stories from his recent trip to Paris. My meal started with a cream of tomato soup, that was much thicker than I had anticipated, but still very tasty. Lunch was a Carolina Crab Cake Salad which was fabulous. Nice view of downtown Charlotte outside our window table from which we were able to watch a rain storm pass, thankfully, before heading back to work."
"1","If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  I booked a reservation for 12 almost two weeks in advance of the date we wanted to dine.  I explained it was a going away party for a member of our team and that we wanted a large table.  I was told that would be no problem.  I was then told I had to give a credit card number to hold the table.  I questioned this as I have made numerous reservations and have never had to do this previously.  Chris stated he would not be able to hold without the information so I reluctantly gave it to him.  We arrived as a group a few minutes early for our reservation at 11:30am.  We were immediately greeted and seated as one of only two occupied tables in the entire restaurant.  The problem is that five (5) of us were at one round table and five (5) of us were at another.  We requested a different table or to push the two together.  We were told by our waiter that it was not possible to do this as the tables were not made to fit together and they had a full booking.  We had one waiter and the other table had a different waiter.  Our waiter was awful.  We had to request drink refills two separate times during our 45 minute wait on our food and he never came back to check on us once he served our food. When I eat out at a supposed \""fine dining\"" establishment and pay $16 and change for a 6 ounce filet, I expect it to be superb. It wasn't.  I would have sent the dish back, but the waiter never returned.  Since it was a business group we couldn't wait another 45 minutes.  A lady at my table ordered the white bean dish and it was so salty she couldn't finish it.  Another diner at my table got the macaroni and cheese as an entree.  The noodles were under done and a bit chewy.  We requested our separate checks the next time we saw the waiter as we needed to get back to work.  When he brought the checks, they had charged us a 20% gratuity.  I asked why and was told because we were in a large party.  I explained to him that I did not feel we should have to pay the gratuity as my reservation was not honored and our service was lacking.  He said it was policy.  I asked for the manager who introduced himself as Eric.  I explained the situation to him.  Having to ask for refills, the long wait, the waiter not coming back ,etc.  He stated we are a large party and it is policy.  I told him we were treated as separate parties.  We were not seated together, did not share the same waiter and did not get served at the same time.  He refused to budge but said he would ask the owner.  I was then approached by the owner/chef.  It was apparent from the look on his face when he approached me that he was ready for battle. His opening words were, \""You got great service and great food so you should pay for it.\""  I told him the service was not great, the food was not great.  I tried to explain the situation.  He told me I should just pay my bill.  I told him we were treated as two separate parties and not seated at the same table.  He stated, \""Well, you walked in the door together.\""  I told him if the $ was that important to him, I would pay it, but that I work for a large corporation within 2 blocks of his restaurant and that I would have thought repeat business and keeping a good relationship with his diners would be worth more than that to him.  He said he didn't appreciate me threatening him (???!!??!) and for me to pay my bill and get out.  I gave the waiter my credit card assuming he meant to pay it without the gratuity, which I was more than willing to do.  When the bill came back, they had charged me the gratuity so I refused to sign it.  Another lady in my party of 5 paid her bill with a 10% tip.  The waiter brought the check back and said it was short.  She said she meant to only tip 10%.  He told her that they had had people ARRESTED FOR REFUSING TO PAY THEIR TIPS BEFORE.  She became frightened and put another $5 bill in the folder and left the restaurant.  Did I mention this lady is in her 60's?  When I refused to sign my check the manager, Eric, told me that by refusing to sign I was refusing to pay and that they would call the police.  I told him to go ahead, but wanted to see the written policy.  He told me it was on the website.   ??? Everyone checks a website before making a reservation?  Then told me it was my lucky day & they wouldn't be calling the cops, but would be taking it up with the credit card company.  Good luck.  Hope that $60 is worth the report to the BBB!"
"1","...and they're closed.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving group of people.  Found out the chef that told me he was the owner was NOT the owner.  Found out he left less than a month after this incident.  The restaurant closed less than four months after that.  Good riddance!"
"2","I was in town for a wedding this past weekend. I forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair, and when I say heavy duty equipment I really mean it. My hair is long, thick, and curly. So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel. When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime. She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use. Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don't usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I've ever had anyone \""understand\"" my hair. She didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing. I wish I could have taken her back home to DC, but she suggested a really good stylist in this area. :)"
"1","Mediocre overpriced threading. Maybe I'm spoiled by my shabby little nails/threading place in New York, but Modern-Phillips Place charged me $70+ for what would be $30-40 in NY (compare business rents). \nSodi threaded my face in no particular order so I ended up with strays. It scared me to death the way she hopped between my sideburns and my brows--you can lose half a brow that way. \nNo consultation on the shaping. MEDIOCRE brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve. She did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so I guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow). The edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way. Holes should appear to be filled in magically. My brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face. She wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape, but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and NO STRAYS.\nNo pre-sanitation or post-care of the skin.\nA mark where she caught my skin in her thread.\nPlus, cold rude staff."
"1","I really wanted this place to be a HIT......but instead it was more of  a #FAIL. \nI'm sure that it was because I was booked with a NEWBIE right out of school and her first week in the Salon. So I would give this salon a second chance but book with someone with more expertise. \n\nThe hair stylist was a sweet girl right out of school was I knew was trying so hard. My Trim & Partial High Lights took 3 1/2 hours though!! Additionally the highlights came out very blocky and with some leopard stripes. The color was not put all the way to the roots so I walked out with ROOTS and a $200 bill.  I told the stylist a few times the issues at hand but each time she started crying and I didn't have the heart to pursue the issue. Disappointed that I walked out with roots when I went in there to get a touch up. \n\nWhen I got down to the parking garage and my \""validated ticket\"" had only been validated for 1/2 the time and I had to spend another $20 to leave the garage. The Manager heard that was I was unhappy with the new girls attempt and sent me a gift card to their salon. A very nice follow up and great recovery. So I would say, sure - check them out. They seem to have a great product line with all natural Aveda products, they have an amazing location in the Heist tower (except for the parking) and a classy salon. Just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience."
"1","$51 Pedicure should have been way better than it was. If you're short, you'll have to be uncomfortable because the seat doesn't adjust. Skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure."
"1","I waited a few months to review because my experience was so bad, I am hoping things have changed by now. I booked my appointment with a third level 'color specialist' to darken my hair a bit, light brown to a solid auburn. After ratting my hair in a knot and then trying to brush it out, more like ripping, and telling me \""pain is beauty\"" numerous times, my hair turned out 2 different shades. The top half being orange and the bottom being orange red. When asked what I thought, I pointed out the two different shades and how orange my hair was. I was told he would put something else on it to even it out. Second time around, still really brassy and two shades. Third time, I said just to go dark brown because we weren't getting it right and I had been there for 3 hours already. I get my hair done every 8 to 12 weeks and have never had an experience like this. The hairdresser was so focused on his personal issues, which I heard about, that I don't think he was paying attention to what he was doing. Safe to say, I was really upset and disappointed when I left. The rest of the staff seemed really nice and the place was pretty and clean, maybe I just caught the hairdresser on a bad day??"
"2","I never have time to make appts in advance and because if that I never seem to be able to see the same stylist twice. At most salons this would worry me but I've never gotten a bad hair cut at modern! I live in NYC and I try to make it back to Charlotte as often as possible to get my hair done here!"
"1","I had Modern Salon and Spa Uptown do my wedding party's hair.  Our hair and make up turned out ok but we felt that we were way over charged.  I had one bridesmaids who was in the chair less than 20 minutes and recieved a curled pony tail.  She was charged $85.00.  Nobody at the salon could understand why we were upset.   \n\nI would not reccomend having your wedding party go to Modern..."
"1","I travel to quite a few conventions, have been here twice.  It is big.  Very big.  Too big, almost.\n\nIt is so easy to get lost in this HUGE multi-level place.  The signage and directions for conventions I have attended have been poor.  I've spent a lot of time wandering around trying to figure out which halls, etc.  There is a nice selection of different little restaurant places inside but - Skip Them!  The best thing about this place is its location on College Street.  There are so many exceptional restaurants within just a few blocks.  And, downtown Charlotte is lovely!  So many fountains, open areas, gardens to visit.\n\nMy other BIG complaint about this place....charging too much for Wi-Fi packages.  Look, stop being cheap.  Business and trade groups are already paying you huge $$$ for the place and services.  Throw in wireless.  Why is this such a hassel?  Because in many places, something about the building seems to really disrupt wireless data signals to your 3G/4G phone.  So, if you're planning on tethering with you cell phone to get wireless, you have to be up in the open common areas to keep from being dropped.  Lame.  Don't even try to get it in the big exhibition hall."
"2","I attended the 2013 AAHPERD National Convention.  A very good venue, with a food court.  I liked it a lot."
"1","The Convention Center needs better souvenir store/vendor. Everything looked old and used. Not a lot of souvenirs to pick. Poor souvenir  store. Need major improvement."
"2","We just had fifty high school students interview here and it was a great location.  Kind of a ghost town because it's so large, but the space was really nice.  Our event coordinator was a bit worried because there were several different people involved (e.g., space, food, parking, etc.) but everything went smoothly and we'll likely host the interviews there again.  In the past we were at the Westin but this place was half the price!  \n\nThe wifi was definitely spotty but it was free so that was a plus.  They had several places to grab some food like Einstein bagels and Bojangles.  We had their catering and it was fantastic.  Has anyone ever said that about convention center catering?  There were a variety of salads, sandwiches, acorn & carrot soup, key lime pie and chocolate mousse.  \n\nOverall, we had a really positive experience and we'll be back!"
"2","The nicest Residence Inn I have stayed in thus far. Very Impressive."
"1","It's a Residence Inn, so by and large you know what to expect- a living area with a sofa-sleeper and a bedroom.\n\nThe reason I typically stay at these when I travel with my family is that we have a three year old. That means I can count on a decent hotel with a door I can close so my kid can sleep and I can watch TV.\n\nNot so much at Uptown Charlotte. The door not only didn't close, it didn't fit the frame.  As in, somebody with \""Hoyt\"" stitched over his pocket would have needed half an hour with a plane to get the damn thing to close.  In addition to that little gem, the guy in the next room decided to conduct business with Bombay at 3am. We listened to mellifluous Hindi for damn near two hours.  I don't blame him, everybody's gotta earn a living, instead I fault the hotel. A guy should be able to make phone calls/watch TV/quietly murder someone next door without waking other guests.\n\nI would probably have ranked the place higher had they decided to come through for us on customer service, however the manager, although a nice guy, only offered to move us to another room for the next night.  Um, we're checking out this morning, genius.  I'm really glad you are going to get right on the problems I pointed out to you, but kinda underwhelmed that your thanks for pointing out your inadequacies is all I get in return."
"2","We had a nice stay here. Staff was very friendly and the room was nice and quiet with a good view of the city. I would say it was a good value."
"1","Booked the penthouse for a night on the town, in the town. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by plenty of construction for the new Knight's ballpark, making getting there a challenge. Once we found our way to the entrance, the clerk at the desk decided that the phone call - possibly a personal call, possibly a take-out order - was much more important than our business. Regardless, we eventually made our way to the room, and it was nice in appearance. Not over-the-top or anything, but nice for a Residence Inn, and nice for our night out.\n\nUnfortunately, the thermostat is the \""hotter and colder\"" variety - not much different than the kind that used to be mounted under the window, it's just now on the wall. Is it really that much more to have the kind you set an actual temperature? It means that throughout the night, it gets way too hot, or way too cold, and makes for an uncomfortable night.\n\nThere are two televisions - one in the living area and one in the bedroom. The one in the living area works with the lineup card, while the one in the bedroom has the digital assignments, such as 76-0010 and whatnot, meaning you can't find anything (including HBO), so if you want to actually watch a show, you'll probably end up watching on the hard-as-a-rock sleeper sofa in the living area.\n\nIf you have to flush the toilet (and many people prefer this option), you lose all water in the bathroom. Not most, or even a particular temperature. It's gone. Not forever, so don't be completely alarmed. But for a few seconds, water completely stops. Not sure if this is unique to this room, or to the 11th floor, but it is a bit odd.\n\nThe hot breakfast is, well hot, but the offering wasn't the greatest. In fact, some other quick-serve, business-style hotels offer a better service and they are only deemed \""continental\"". If you go to an Embassy Suites, with their made-to-order breakfasts, it's much, much better.\n\nAll-in-all, we had a passable night, but I'm not sure if I'd stay again."
"2","Stayed here while in Charlotte for my conference and it was very nice, one thing I love about staying at Residence Inn's is the nightly reception with wine, beer and snacks. \nThe breakfast buffet was fresh every morning and fully stocked. The room was very big and the two TVs were great. \n\nWhat else can one ask for in a stay. About a 8 min walk to the convention center."
"1","Good location. Terrible front desk staff & way over priced. The front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin. She kept answering the phone even though others were there. We had an issue as when I booked via my phone it didn't say there was a $75 fee for a pet. We left. Made a one night stay $325. Ummm you are a Marriott not the Ritz"
"2","[SHOCKED!]  No one has written a review about B&N in the Arboretum??!!??\n\nI guess that does illustrate the shift in bookstores will the online market like Amazon....  I do like the steps that B&N are taking to try to adjust to the times.  Example 1:  The Nook E-Reader is pretty cool and shows that it will give the Kindle a run for it's money.  Still there is no e-replacement of a physical book in ones hand and the smell of pages as you thumb through.\n\nThis B&N is large, very large.  There is a coffee shop located in the center of it and tons of seats and couches around the store for nestling in for a good read.  I always feel guilty doing that and not buying anything, but to each his/her own.\n\nThat being said, the pricing in the store is habitually higher than prices you can fine online.   Even books in their \""bargain\"" section seem a little high as well.\n\nI'll stick to using the store to browse and for gift ideas for the time being."
"2","I just went through training this past week for a new job that I start on Monday. The company gave us uniforms that this woman altered and had ready on Saturday. (3/9/13) She worked on 2 of my friends' shirts & pants and three pairs of my pants. Our company paid for all of the alterations. I thought that was great service!"
"1","This review is for alterations only. Based on other reviews here, it seems they are good at dry cleaning, so I'm suggesting they just stick to that. I had a handful of garments altered here and they all turned out poorly.\n\nI needed some business casual clothing taken in and hemmed on short notice. That's what I got. I even got a discount for paying cash. Everything seemed great until I got home and tried on the garments. \n\nOn one pair of pants, the legs were hemmed at different lengths (one shorter than the other). On another pair, only the back seam was taken in (rather than the 2 sides), moving the back pockets ridiculously close together. A blouse was taken in too much near the top and not enough at the bottom, causing a lot of pulling across the bust and a weirdly loose fit elsewhere. \n\nBottom line: trust them to clean your clothes, but not to alter them."
"2","Really great food here! Always quick, clean and helpful!"
"2","Gotta love Salsarita's, one of my favorite lunch spots.  Fresh food, great salsa, great prices!  My only suggestion would be to add grilled fish taco's to the menu."
"1","Wow, not a lot of one stars in my review history so here we go......Salsarita's was the first \""Mexican\"" place I tried when I moved to Charlotte....from Phoenix. Needless to say, I had high expectations, even if it was a step above Taco Bell. My first experience was absolutely horrible--I ordered a burrito which was cold, wet and dripping some kind of funky juice. Gross.\n\nI went there a number of times after my initial bad experience and all I can think is no. I went there solely because for awhile were no other Mexican food options Uptown close to me and they offer a number of coupons in the Citpass book. But I've always been disappointed there, even up to last wk when I went there for the last time ever. Maybe it's the fact that the food had no flavor (seriously how does spicy salsa have no flavor?) or the fact that any time I used my check card there and didn't give them a tip (you know since they prepared my food), they would add a $1 or $2 in the tip line.....every....single....time. No bueno, sorry Salsarita's, you are officially Salsash***ty's in my book."
"2","I adore this Salsarita's. The food is consistent, it represents the brand well, and to top it all off the staff is fantastic. They have a greeter at the door almost every day and the staff will fulfill any request. I'm a salsa addict, and they will ad as much salsa as I want. Good food, fantastic staff."
"2","Good food and great staff!"
"2","Yikes... as much as I frequent this place, I am puzzled as to why I haven't reviewed it - or maybe I reviewed another location by accident.  Anyways....  This location at Overstreet is super convenient to my office so I do get breakfast AND lunch here often.\n\nDuring the lunch rush, this place can be a mad-house with the line that stretches from the start of the counter out into the Overstreet mall main drag.  There is a dividing wall to keep it all together and make sure no one jumps the line and they recently added some extra pony walls for the dine-in guests to have more privacy and more crowd control (my bet).\n\nThe folks working the line are always nice and the line moves fast (if customers know what they want and how the system works).\n\nThis location also does breakfasts and lunches for offices so sometimes you can see the booths on the side of the restaurant are occupied by items for catering."
"2","This is the first restaurant that I went to for dinner when I moved to Charlotte.  We popped in for dinner after a day of moving -  not knowing what to expect.  The food and drinks were delicious.  Great seafood.   Drinks were a little pricey but the atmosphere was worth it.  Service was very good.  Seemed like a secret local place that didn't get too crowded - we walked right in on a Saturday night."
"2","The Monticello is a great place to have a civilized breakfast.  They have fresh-squeezed orange juice, a nice Eggs Benedict, and even hearty yellow grits.  It is located in a charming uptown Charlotte neighborhood, near a library and several museums."
"2","My soon-to-be-Mother-in-law loves the Dunhill, so we had an awesome dinner at Monticello the night she arrived.\n\nTo tell the truth, I was expecting the worst (Pasta Primavera with Roasted Red Pepper, I hate you). I was more than pleasantly surprised to find several veg appetizers and an inventive vegetarian main on their exclusive menu. \n\nBut, I had to do the obnoxious - ask the chef to put an entree together for me, something I often do at restaurants of this price range. He immediately agreed, asked me a few questions, and disappeared. Not a short time later, a pile of thinly sliced cauliflower quinoa pilaf, garnished with edible orchids and microgreens, and SMOTHERED in a honey-butter broth appeared in front of my bulging eyes. DE-licious, but almost too rich for such a balmy night. He made a point of checking on his creation (which had already found its way into my belly), which was awesome.\n\nService was less formal than I expected, which was fine by me. Very small, old school feel, perfectly dim lighting. This meal reminds me that I have to stop ignoring Uptown cuisine. I hear the brunch is amazing and super affordable. I'll be back."
"1","My first meal as a Charlottean was had at this establishment.  I had a taste for fish, and so was pleased to find more than a few appealing options on the dinner menu.  I opted for the trout, preceded by the classic french onion soup.  David X. had the special, a smoked salmon pasta.\n\nThe good: the trout was delightful, well complimented by potatoes and a light tomatoey sauce.  The portions were perfect, aka not too big.  Basically this dish saved the experience for me.\n\nThe ok: the bread was warm (not hot) and the salmon special was pretty good too.  Smoked salmon plus creamy sauce, yum.\n\nThe underwhelming: the french onion soup was not hot.  The cheese was not bubbling or gooey, it was a bit congealed.  Meh.  And, to echo the words of others, the service was more than just pokey.  This was a bit absurd because we were the only people eating in the restaurant.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe, to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much. Maybe they're a bit more on top of their game for breakfast/brunch.  But probably not for dinner."
"1","\""Every Christmas Story Ever Told\"" was slow and not that funny. Spoiled by comedy and improv options in bigger cities, we expected something more fast paced. The first half DRAGGED."
"2","Support local! I love this place and they have a special showing of all their shows I think at least once a month called 'Pay What You Can Night'.  That's just icing on the cake.  I went here last night with my girlfriend and our friends and I wasn't really looking for anything fantastic in terms of talent or venue.  Boy was I surprised.  Maybe not so much in terms of the venue but the talent was superb.  The staff and opening host of the show were super friendly.  The place really has a grass roots feel to it and I love it.\n\nI would suggest anyone to come check out a show here and support this local theater."
"2","This is a nice cozy place to Explore New (and old) projects. \nI came in on Friday night to see Clayborne Park. Great show, good set up. \nNice drinks\nFriendly staff\n\nI will return!!\n\n\nLOCAL NOT FOR PROFIT"
"2","I'm glad that a YELP event brought me here. The theater is small and feels really comfortable.\n\nParking is bountiful and free! Yes, the signs may be confusing but the friendly staff is there to ease all concerns. \n\nThere are plenty of drink and snack options and a nice sitting area out front with cozy chairs and tables. When you walk into the theater, the seats are comfy and no matter where you chose you have a good view of the stage...I appreciated that very much!  \n\nI absolutely love supporting local venues and events! The play was very entertaining and it's always good to spend a night out with other Yelpers. \n\n I will definitely be back!"
"2","I was recently privileged to receive free tickets for myself and a friend to the play, \""The Divine Sister,\"" courtesy of Yelp Elite.  I have been a fan of Actor's Theatre for several years.  A big plus for this location is free and easily accessible parking.  It offers snacks and drinks for sale that one can take into the theatre.  Sometimes, they offer beer and wine whose names compliment the theme of that evening's production.  ATC also features Cult Movie Mondays in addition to plays and musicals.  This evening's performance of \""The Divine Sister\"" delivered the bawdy, irreverent humor that is characteristic of this theatre.  Another success in a long line of accomplishments.  Thanks to Ben and J.J. for orchestrating a fun and entertaining evening!"
"2","Went to see \""The Great American Trailer Park Musical\"".  The show was awesome - very well produced and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  My bar drink, while pricey, was ...generous, to say the least.  It lasted the entire show! :)\n\nWe will definitely be back - we had a wonderful time and felt very welcomed."
"1","Worse than Cans.  And that's saying something!"
"1","Bar Charlotte is a place where golddiggers go to listen to pop rap and find sugar daddies.  There is a huge dancefloor in the center of the bar with sweaty eighteen year olds bumping and grinding on one another, and half naked girls dancing on bars and tabletops.  I really would not recommend this joint to anyone who has any real taste in music and/or respect for themselves.  The drinks are overpriced, and the girls are underage.  Save your time."
"1","In the same (horrible) vein as the next door Have A Nice Day, this place is the definition of 'meat market'.\n\nA dark, dimly lit, sweaty joint where oversexed teenagers and college-age kids go to bump and grind to obnoxious rap and house music.\n\nFor some reason this place is often crowded, and the bathrooms are an exercise in survival, as you either get accosted by drunk or drugged-out people while in line or by the guy in the monkey-suit trying to get you to buy some smell-good or tip him as you're leaving.\n\nHorrible way to spend an evening if you like good music, care to be around people who respect themselves, and if you care to have a meaningful conversation with anyone."
"1","In my group of friends we affectionaly refer to this place as where all the fat chicks hang. Why they would attract that kind of crowd and keep the bull in there is BEYOND me. If your a chubby chaser you'll love this place!"
"2","The bar was really fun!  I had never been to a place like this before and didn't know what to expect.  The drinks and music were really good.  My husband and I had a blast and will definitely be back."
"1","Came here twice this weekend. Is it worth the $15 cover on Fridays? Not really. I thought it was a bit too much. If you're into seeing old creepy men looking up your skirt, overpriced drinks, half naked bar girls spanking you with a paddle and acting like a drunk fool on the mechanical bull, well you found a lovely place. The DJ was great though. Nice mix of pop and hip hop music."
"1","Wow, I've been here a total of 2 times and both times I've confirmed one thing.  This really isn't somewhere I want to be.  Very young crowd normally in here and I've equated bulls in bars to be something that just doesn't sit well with seeking a more mature crowd.  But I highly doubt the owners of BAR really care because the place does get packed and the youngin's there seem to really love the place.\n\nThe music they play seems to be a good mix, they go through a cycle of typical club hits and some 70's throwback."
"1","If you're a black male don't go to Bar Charlotte, they are racist. I was denied entry on 12/21/12. The door man, said I was denied entry because of my boots.On the website it says that the dress code was no construction boots, which I clearly had on Aldo boots. I am a successful, preppy looking black guy. This has never happened to me before at any other club downtown.I cant believe people are still bigots and its about be 2013 :CC"
"1","I'll try to be objective here. So disclaimer first, I would prefer a bar with a small dance floor over a large club with seizure inducing strobe lights any day. Yes guys, there are plenty of young girls here. It isn't difficult to find several packs of half-drunk girls to grind on, and if you lack confidence to approach at least the bartenders are gorgeous. This is the perfect place to find someone to take home, and it's so loud you don't have to worry about all the dumb things you say. Truthfully though it's just not my scene. I don't won't to sound pretentious, but this place feels dirty and you will most likely step in vomit or at least spilled beer. As others have said, it's mostly hip-hop, when I was there I rarely heard any house or trance. The crowd definitely trends younger, mostly in their teens or low 20s. I'm 25 and I almost felt too old there. But maybe that says more about me than it does Bar Charlotte. For that reason, I can't give this place less than two stars. Just know what you're getting into, it's your typical teenage get drunk and go nuts kind of club. That could be just what you're looking for. But the $15 cover on a Friday night is steep, and for me it just wasn't worth it."
"1","I was banned for life from this bar in the Spring of 2006."
"1","The bar itself is good and the servers do a great job but man do the patrons suck! I went once and some guy decided to \""make it rain\"" and started flipping out because dudes were picking up the money. If you're dumb enough to throw a pile of money in to the air you better bet your ass that us broke college kids are going to pick it up! It's also predominantly African American (or at least it was when I went) which is totally fine but some of them looked like gang members. I'm sure I'll get called racist for that but it's the honest truth. I also saw a lot of people getting upset over the dumbest stuff...like getting their shoes stepped on, while standing in the middle of the dance floor! I will say they had a great deal on drinks when I went! $1 for anything!"
"2","Upscale soul food.  Cornbread, fried chicken, pork chops, salmon cakes, beef ribs, shrimp and grits, red beans, mac n cheese.  Man I wish there was a joint like this in SF!  My Dad once had the soft shell crab hoagie and almost cried it was sooo good..."
"2","This is one of the places that you have to go to if you are in Charlotte.  It is local and very unique and you will not find anything like it anywhere else.  \n\nThe food is interesting and the atmosphere is very unique.  I have been there many times and have never been disspointed."
"2","Great food, great experience - as an out of town traveler who doesn't like to eat fast food every single day, finding Mert's was a pleasure.  Keeping prices down and providing a great experience is hard at any restaurant but Mert's doesn't skimp when it comes to down home food.  The tables are basic and the look and feel are simple, but this shouldn't stop you from enjoying yourself thoroughly - beginning with their tasty fresh cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it's ribs or pulled pork.  Although this place is in North Carolina, I was happily surprised by a sauce that didn't overpower with vinegar.  On the whole, I was very happy with Mert's and will definitely go again!"
"1","This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I came because a lot people and media were talking about it. I took my Mom on Sunday for her birthday. \n\nThe only thing good about our meal was the water, orange juice and corn bread snack. Actually, the OJ was room temperature, so it was 'borderline good'.\n\nI ordered smoked pork chops, home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes, collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor, but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes, people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.\n\nMy Mom's salmon cakes were dry, the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.\n\nNot only was the food bad, but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).\n\nI won't go back because the meal was expensive (w/tip), the parking was terrible and the food was no good.\n\nIt was a total disappointment for me. I was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant."
"2","If you're new to Charlotte and still adjusting to living in the New South, go to Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown. I can pretty much guarantee that the macaroni and cheese, sweet tea, biscuits, meatloaf and all the other soul food will remind you why Charlotte is a good place to live. \n\nYou can order food from Mert's online, which is a convenient perk. I've been to a couple events catered by Mert's. Mm mm."
"1","It's OK.  It's soul food.  The fried chicken was straight forward.  Not likely to go back for just that, as Price's is much better in my opinion.  \n\nI was also able to sample the BBQ pork... It was a tad weird.  My girlfriend accurately pointed out it tasted like curry.   I would steer clear of that. \n\nThe mac and cheese was good because, let's be honest, it's cheese and cheese is good.  The collards were authentic and would get them again.  \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive.  \n\nOverall rating - Just an OK."
"1","I had high expectations considering that I was in the South.  I love the food in the South!  However the experience here was not very good!  \n\nI grew up eating most of the food on the menu, and I tend to make strong comparisons against that home cooking.  In addition, I love food, and I have a wide taste bud ranging from various regions of the world.\n\nThe food was delivered to me at my table very very very very very hot.  I was unable to comfortably eat for approx. 7 to 10 minutes.   I ordered Fried Chicken, Greens, Yams, Catfish, and Banana Pudding.  The previous day, my business colleague order and ate the red beans and rice.\n\nService was good.  The menu needs help.\n\n1) The Fried Chicken wasn't really fried.  It looked like baked chicken that was dried out.  Not crispy looking, not seasoned. Not very tasty.\n2) The Catfish was a complete fish with bones.  The taste was pretty good! However, I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to de-bone every bite.\n3) The Greens were good!\n4) Yams were good!\n5) Corn bread was just ok\n6) Banana Pudding was very good!\n7) Red beans rice and sausage was not good.\n\nAll and all, the Merts was just ok,  However, if in town again, I would not be compelled to re-visit...and I love Soul Food."
"2","The fried catfish was perfect.  The sides were good too.  the service was good and the people friendly.  Good place."
"2","What a great find in Charlotte! Mert's Heart and Soul is just that- a little bit of food love in the city. \n\nWe went for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. As we pushed open the door- we were greeted by Robin who quickly seated us, took note of my lack of accent and asked where I was from, and got us going with some great cornbread and butter as we sipped our beers and looked over the menu. \n\nBreakfast? Lunch? Breakfast? Lunch? Well breakfast won out but only by a fraction of a point as the southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes and green beans were definitely calling to me. \n\nBut I went with the omelet with ham and cheese and a side of buttermilk pancakes. My dining companion went with the eggs and country ham (ooh- that is some salty ham!) Both were served with a side of home fries. The food was great. But the service was even better. \n\nRobin took great care of us, making sure we had everything we needed and told me I just \""had to try\"" the cornbread so she brought that out as well. Loved the music- Sam Cooke, and Sam and Dave played through our entire breakfast adding to the ambiance. \n\nThis is not a fancy place. But one that serves up good food, with friendly service and reasonable prices. Breakfast for two with drinks ran about $34. Definitely on my list to go back to the next time I'm in Charlotte."
"1","Well--after I was done, and I didn't finish half my plate I decided not to take home the rest and wished I didn't eat the calories I ate the catfish wasn't worth it. I decided to give them one last try on a slice of pound cake to take home with me. It was wrapped up in Saran wrap and put in a box when i opened it, the texture was dry and hard, and it wasn't big enough to charge almost $4...  there were flies everywhere. I won't be back anytime soon"
"2","Definitely a great choice for some good southern food that isn't too expensive.  I use to frequent this restaurant almost weekly before relocating to Arizona.  I must say it's one of the main things I miss about living in Charlotte.  Have yet to find a place like it (especially in Arizona)"
"2","I might move to Charlotte just so I can eat here every week. Both the atmosphere and food is excellent. Superb low country cuisine!\nI wanted to eat everything on the menu and nearly did. I ate the lamb chops - unbelievable! Mac and cheese was very good. The desserts just about killed me but I could not pass on them since I knew I was leaving town the next day. If you are anywhere near Charlotte you have to visit this place."
"1","I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing, I decided to go with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday with lunch at Mert's.  After the most interesting discussion (!) with manager (?) I discovered that I did not have the necessary \""proof\"" to rate the birthday \""deal\"" in spite of having a valid NC driver license clearly showing my date of birth.  In today's economy, I was stunned that any food establishment would take such a tack with a good paying customer!  No worries on seeing my dollars at Mert's ever again.  To many restaurants want my patronage.\n-cheers"
"1","Would never go back!  I was in a party of 3 that was seated at a table for 4, and was then asked if we could move to accommodate another group.  Okay, not a big deal.  However, it all went down hill from there.  Our waitress was nice and polite, but we waited for close to an hour and still nothing showed up at our table.  The people that were sitting at our original table had been served and had already left.  We asked our waitress a number of times why we weren't getting our food, and she kept apologizing and saying \""it's on it's way.\""  But it never came.  It wasn't like we ordered anything unusual, it was eggs, sausage and toast.  The whole thing was weird because others were getting served, and their food was arriving at their table.  Finally, we just said thanks, but no thanks and left."
"2","Food was VERY good. We had a picky eater with us who claimed he did NOT like \""greens.\""  Our waitress Paris suggested he try their greens. He did. He now loves greens! I had some, too, and they were very good. The cornbread is also very good. And the fried chicken. Actually, everything we ate was very good. I ordered the catfish and was reluctant at first since they give you a whole fish and I feared getting the meat off the bones. Nothing to fear; the flesh slides so effortlessly off the bone that it was a pleasure eating it - and quite tasty with that \""special sauce.\"" \n\nParis waited on us hand and foot. She had good suggestions from the menu and she kept our beverage glasses full. She was very friendly and a delight to have serve us.\n\nWe dined outside since there was a nice cool gentle breeze blowing. I wish the outside ambiance was nicer; maybe they can surround it with more potted trees/shrubs to block it from the street. \n\nI would recommend eating here if you like good home-cooked food."
"2","Good soul food in a great downtown setting. \nNot the best I've tasted but darn good. \nThe cornbread is outstanding."
"2","I went to Mert's for lunch based off the reviews here and recommendations from coworkers.  I wasn't disappointed.  Mert's has an atmosphere that is trying to look like a dive diner, but comfortable and clean as well.  The atmosphere works well here.   I ordered the jumbo chicken wings with greens and mac-n-cheese as my sides.  The chicken wings were big and fried crispy, the greens were very tasty as was the mac-n-cheese.  The cornbread has to be some of the best I have ever had.  The greeens and mac-n-cheese were not the best I have ever had, but they were right up towards the top of my list.  The place was fairly busy as I expected and the service was OK.  I recieved my drink and food promptly, but my server never checked back.  I never really needed anything so I didn't suffer, but I can't give 5 stars because of that.  If you like good home cooked goodness then Mert's is the place to go."
"2","Had breakfast here, super yummy southern biscuits!  Looks a little dingy but that's the charm."
"2","Always friendly, the staff here will usually go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Everything I've tried is great, but special note goes to the cornbread and the catfish. The collard greens are also great, slightly tangy and with a good feel, not overcooked. This is soul food without going overboard on salt and fat. Of course, they are there, just not as much as some soul food places.  I wish they had pie."
"1","Wanted to like this place. Staff very friendly. Reasonable prices. Quick service. \nBut plates were dirty. Table dirty. Food just OK."
"2","Great comfort food!  Really cool find downtown near the train, museums, etc.  Love it!"
"2","Extremely tasty food.  I inhaled my plate of salmon cakes, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  The cornbread was tasty and buttery.  The service was fast and friendly, the sweet tea was syrupy sweet and the interior is very entertaining.\nMy sister enjoyed a dessert - was it sweet potato cake?  Something that seemed a bit odd to me.\nAs far as uptown southern goes, I'd say Mert's is your spot for casual, friendly, quick but still very tasty - a nice place to hang out with friends.  King's is better for dressy and classy."
"2","Mamma better slap me, because I just sinned... \n\nLet me explain, I just got spoiled, I was rewarded with delicious food, and I didn't do anything to deserve it.  You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \n\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \n\nLet's break down the meal.\n\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \n\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\n\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \n\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\n\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\n\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \n\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food. Location isn't easy to find at first, but you want food, and you are in downtown, make this a perfect spot, for you and all your friends."
"1","SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  \n\nDETAILS:\nWe were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right, and the appetizer (soul sampler) came out in a very reasonable time.  But it took at least another 20 minutes (maybe even 30) to get our entrees: BBQ with sides, and blackened pork chops with sides. And while the sides and chops all got good comments, we did NOT like the very molasses-heavy BBQ.  This is nothing like I've ever eaten in North or South Carolina (and I'm a native).  That needs to be revamped or better disclaimed on the menu.\n\nAnyway, so unlike my previous visits, I left very disappointed and unfortunately, left my out-of-town friends with a bad impression of what has usually been a good place."
"2","All I can say is YUMMM!!! My fiance and I are new to Charlotte so this was our first try at true Southern style soul food. Mert's was not a disappointment. The service was friendly. Very cozy southern feeling atmosphere. Very casual and chill and best of all, not overpriced! \n\nBiggest recommendations: The cornbread is to die for!!! OMG! The chicken is wonderful and the mac and cheese is soooo good! \n\nDefinitely worth checking out!"
"2","Ard took a picture of his beef ribs with his Blackberry. \n\nFive minutes later: \""It's got 25 Likes! Damn, people are hungry! The economy *is* bad!\""\n\nIf a mere picture of Mert's ribs gets 25 likes, imagine how many their flavor would get. \n\nWe stopped by after the wildly entertaining nuttiness of Speed Street. After a couple of beers on a hot night, all you need is grease to soak up the booze. That said, Mert's delivered, not greasy food, but high-quality, delicious, heavy Southern food that will absorb anything left in your system, and leave some cholesterol as a gift with purchase. \n\nI got the Soul Rolls, essentially soulified egg rolls, with black eye peas, collard greens, rice, and a wee bit of diced chicken breast (though I didn't taste much of the chicken. Could have just been my particular rolls, tho). The others got varying dishes of fried chicken and beef ribs, with sides of fries, mac & cheese, collard greens, and the works. \n\n\""You know, if I worked here, they would find me in the back with my head in a bucket of this mac & cheese,\"" Ard said.\n\nYep, basically. Some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had in a restaurant. \n\nService is great here, too. Everyone was so patient with the troops of drunk teenagers who wandered in to use the bathroom, despite the sign on the door that read, \""Bathrooms for paying customers only.\"" Our server, Netta, made sure that I ordered first, as a fellow Netta. So nice! \n\nI think there's enough reviews here to cover ambiance, so I won't go on about that. But Mert's is cozy and the food is delish. Go enjoy!"
"2","I had the pleasure of taking a coworker to Mert's for her first time today. We had an amazing lunch! The place was packed but we didn't have to wait. The waitresses were super busy with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no less charming and friendly.\n\nI've been once before and I highly recommend the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.\n\nI don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!"
"2","This place serves excellent Low Country/Country Cooking dishes at reasonable prices - at least the prices are reasonable at lunch, $7 - $9 for a entree which comes with 2 sides and corn bread.\n\nThe Fried Chicken is excellent, The Ribs are as well, and I love the Salmon Cakes. The Fried Catfish is good, any of the Po' Boys are worth trying. The Fried Green Tomato app is nice, not as tart as some, but still good. The Collards are not to my liking, and  I've tried them twice.\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits are nice, rich and creamy. But, I was disappointed in the Shrimp Creole, was bland and watery. Service here is excellent, even when this place is busy, which it always seems to be. The ambiance is homey, though it can get a little loud."
"2","First let me say FREE PARKING!!!! The food was great the service was excellent the potato salad was just wonderful. The staff was super friendly the atmosphere was perfect."
"2","This place is really good.  The staff was great, food fresh, and a great menu.  \n\nI will always return whenever in Downtown."
"1","To sum up my recent trip to Mert's...pretty delicious food yet poor customer service. The only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread. Our waiter was very inconsistent and neglecting us. There were at least four tables with more than three customers which received their entrees before my girlfriend and I did. It will be a very long time before I go to Merts again."
"2","GOOD food! I recommend the salmon cakes, greens, mac n cheese. Their cornbread is amazing, as well!\nThe ambiance is something out of an old soul's home...amazing pictures of celebrities who've been in town & the soul music overhead is so good!\nThe staff is friendly & attentive.\nKeep in mind, they stay pretty busy for lunches & dinners.\nWhat's REALLY good is their New Year's brunch, every Jan. 1st. $20 for all you can eat buffet!"
"2","This is one of those places you can go at lunch time and run into everyone from your local car detailer to power-brokers like the former CEO of NationsBank (now Bank of America).  The food is absolutely delish, but be warned - your clothes and hair will smell of southern-fried goodness when you leave. If you are craving good ole soul food - aka southern \""comfort foods\"" this place is a must-try!"
"2","Cool, casual service and the home of probably the best cornbread I have ever had in my LIFE. In my view, you can't go wrong with Mert's. Happy eating!"
"2","The waitress was very nice and the food was delicious.  I had the fried whiting, home fries and coleslaw.  The whiting had a few bones but cooked perfect and my husband asked me to please bring him a piece of red velvet cake back to Texas.  How's that for service?  Nice place and I will go back."
"2","This place was amazing! It looks like a little dive-bar in the heart of downtown Charlotte, but once you walk in you know you're home! Everyone was super friendly and happy to explain anything on the menu or make recommendations. I had the boneless fried chicken (how do they make plain-ol' chicken taste SO incredible?!) and couldn't decided between coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy, or macaroni and cheese and the waitress suggested the two starches... I was sceptical but couldn't have been happier once my meal came. Oh, and be sure to start with the warm cornbread and honey butter!"
"2","This is the only restaurant I had the chance to visit when I was in Charlotte last weekend and I was not disappointed.  I was warned that it is a hole in the wall, but it's not.  Just a casual restaurant.\n\nWe arrived around 2pm on a Saturday and were quickly seated.  After ordering, our food arrived about 10 minutes later.  I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese and greens.  And because I'm greedy and have no shame I also got a side of mashed taters (just so I could try them).\n\nI really enjoyed my food.  It was hot and delicious.  The mac n cheese was very cheesy and satisfying.  The mashed taters were lumpy like I like it.  And the cornbread was good too.  A nice little loaf with some creamy, sweet butter.\n\nI think my meal was about 10 bucks with a drink.   My only complaint is that the portions were kinda small.  Maybe I'm just used to bigger portions in Atlanta, but I could have enjoyed 1/4 more food.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly."
"2","You get a lot of food - for a very good price.  Meal starts of with giant steaming mini cornbreads.  Order an entree and get choice of two sides (mac and cheese, potatoes, fries etc).  \n\nFried chicken was great.  Sides were somewhat disappointing.  Cornbread was amazing!"
"1","In my opinion EPIC FAIL ...... I'm from Charlotte and my first time going there was last week and boy was i not impressed. I guess when soul food come to my mind i think of greatness because I'm from the south, it could be a lot better."
"1","The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again."
"1","I rarely give bad reviews, but this was a pretty horrible food experience. My cousin was in town today from Seattle and requested \""good soul food.\"" I've heard good things about Mert's, but have not had an opportunity to try. I figured it would be a good opportunity to show my cousin some good souther food. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The fried chicken was pretty bland. It seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long. The collard greens were insanely salty. Instant high blood pressure for sale! :( I ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard. I have to say that the corn bread was absolutely amazing, which makes no sense that the rest of the food was so unappetizing."
"1","When we first moved to Charlotte, NC from Savannah, I was really looking forward to trying Southern food here. A lot of people suggested Mert's. One word-YUCK! We ordered simple items. Fried chicken, macaroni and cheese and collards. The chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland. The service wasn't great either. She leaned over our table,with her butt in the other patrons face the entire time. Not impressed. I went a second time just in case they were having a bad day. I ordered catfish with okra and tomatoes. Again-YUCK! The catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it. The okra and tomatoes were alright. Still searching for a great southern restaurant."
"2","Yummy true soul food! I always get the vegetable plate when I go because I can't choose between the many (all amazing) sides. The collared greens are the best I've ever had! Everything is salty, but that's expected at soul food restaurants. Mert's is always crowded, but you're usually seated quickly. Quickness of service always depends on the server. Seating is pretty close to other tables, but not a biggie. My biggest turn-off is downtown parking...you have to park in a parking garage and walk to the restaurant. Still a favorite of mine!"
"2","Definitely hidden. They serve good brunch on the weekends and you won't wait in a ridiculous line full of degenerates.   Make sure to get their biscuits."
"2","I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall, nice place to eat."
"1","The service here sucks. We went there and they got us the main meal before the appetizer and bread.  When I requested to have my appetizer first, the waitress replied that they are expecting lots of people from the convention and they are trying to get us out as fast as possible. I immediately left. \n\nNever going to go back again."
"2","I'm somewhat embarrassed about this review as I work in Uptown, love this kind of cooking, have known Mert's existed but have never gone!  Remedied that on Wednesday morning and seriously had perhaps the best breakfast I've ever had.\n\nI got just the basics - scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, biscuit and a buttermilk pancake on the side.  OMFG!  Perfectly cooked eggs, two huge sausage patties that were seared on the outside and moist/tender on the inside (yes they were cooked through!)  :)  Everything was just as I would order a breakfast if it were my last breakfast on earth.  My wife had similar but substituted bacon, grits and a sweet potato pancake. she was in breakfast nirvana as well.  Even the coffee was a notch above your typical breakfast joint fare.\n\nAND...  As I sat there eating this deliciousness, I had to stare at the lunch special menu board and there was not one thing on it I wouldn't have ordered.  There is no doubt I'm coming back soon for lunch.\n\nOn the service side it was fast, friendly and really nice teamwork among the servers with everyone paying attention to coffee cups getting low, etc.  What a jewel for the Queen City!"
"1","Horrible!!"
"2","The food was great!  Waitress was funny.  But I still like Paschal's fried chicken better."
"1","This place was just OK for me.  I was pretty disappointed with the fried chicken because I felt it could have been more flavorful and more fried.  I was surprised because I would have expected more. The catfish my dad and sister ordered was way more fried than the chicken my mom and me had ordered. Also, don't expect the fish to be a fillet. It's a whole fish.\n\nEven though our server was very friendly, I was also very disappointed with him. It was rare that he came by to check on us and he had also forgotten to give us the corn bread. When he wasn't there to check on us, we resorted to asking a different waitress that walked by for boxes and the check. However, she didn't bother, probably because we weren't her table. Rudeness...\n\nOverall experience could have been better, but at least we tried it."
"2","I wish I could give half stars because I'd truly rate Mert's as a 3.5 (or even 3.75) out of  5. But to be fair, I will round up to 4. \n\nI have been to Mert's four times in the past year and have been pleased with each visit. The service and ambiance is great. The art and music promotes an inviting warm home-style environment.\n\nI'm only giving this place 3.5 stars because of the food. It is tasty, but not the best southern cuisine I've had. I was raised on southern cooking and am aware of variations in seasoning and techniques for one location to another. However, although good, the food does not satisfy my appetite when I'm in the mood for \""soul food\"" or southern cooking. I'm sure this varies from one person to the next. So, try it out yourself!   :)\n\nAlso, I've had the catfish and chicken here, but my favorite meat at Mert's is the ribs."
"2","Man, I've had this place bookmarked almost since I first found Yelp in Charlotte. I've just never had an opportunity to eat here until I had some friends staying in Uptown and they wanted a \""Charlotte meal\"". So here's to Mert's and one less bookmark!\n\nClassic Southern soul food. Collard greens and fried okra and fried chicken and sausage gravy and all those yummy things that just put weight on when you mention their names! I was tempted by so much but when the waiter mentioned their specials, I knew that the grilled pork chop in white gravy was for me. And it was. Excellent and tasty with lots of flavor and spice, I cleaned the plate and then picked up the bone for chewing. Great stuff. For sides, I had the mac & cheese (excellent!) and the yams (only meh).\n\nFor dessert, the peach cobbler was only okay - an overwheming spiciness. I think that I might have just gotten a bad scoop, because my friend who had it really liked his. The vanilla ice cream gave it the right consistency, but the flavor wasn't right.\n\nStreet parking only, but it's barely a stone's throw from the LYNX Station so consider taking the train!"
"2","My husband and I love food, saw all the great reviews and decided to check Mert's out. We started with the BBQ beef ribs and when my husband put a piece in his mouth, he made a sound that startled me! Lol. I was like what's wrong and he was like, \""Geez, this is awesome!\"" I had the whiting, which was perfectly seasoned. He had the salmon cakes meal. Plates were cleaned! Great find. Oh, make sure you park in the lot where they are located as this is the only lot they can offer validation for. We did save room for desert. Peach cobbler was perfect, but the strawberry cake was way too sweet. I love sweets but even this was like an overdose."
"1","Had the Shrimp Po Boo.  I wish I know that it would be spicy I would have asked them to hold the spice.  Even the Home Fries where spicy.  I understand that it's southern home cooking, however other items on the menu warn that it's spicy.  I understand it's not a four star restaurant, however the batter on the popcorn shrimp could have more crispy.  Perhaps the fryer was not to temperature when they sunk them.  Despite the spiciness of the potatoes they where fresh and not cooked that long, although personally I do like crispy home fries.  Having said that portion was good size, price average with other restaurants in the area.  Service was my biggest issue.  While the waitress did keep checking back to see if we where ready to order, however she never asked if I would like another Ice Tea.  I needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention."
"2","While visiting Charlotte for the DNC, I must say that Merts made me feel as if I never left home.  I dined there for breakfast and two dinners.\n\nFor breakfast I had two eggs, bacon, biscuits and home fries.  Everything was very enjoyable but where Merts really shines is at night.\n\nFor dinner, I had the salmon cakes on one occasion and the fried catfish on the other.  On the side, I had yams and greens and a sweet tea to wash it all down.  I managed to save enough room for dessert and enjoyed a slice of sweet potato cake.  The cake was moist and delicious and the frosting was nothing short of decadent.\n\nMerts portions are huge.  If only my hotel had a mini fridge, I could have taken my leftovers back to my room.\n\nThe wait staff is super friendly.  As for its location, Merts is very convenient to lots of hotels in downtown Charlotte."
"2","UMM, UMM GOOD! I had to say that in capital letters just to get my point across how good Mert's is! I've been to a few soul food restaurants, where they claim \""everything is homemade\"" but when it comes to Mert's that's exactly what you get! Homemade biscuits and even ..are you ready for this? Homemade butter!! The beef ribs fall off the bone and the mac n cheese is the real deal, no boxed stuff here! \n\nThe desserts, what do you choose when you have a choice of German Chocolate, Red Velvet, Sweet Potato, Coconut Cake, Pound cake, Banana Pudding, along with Peach, Apple, & Blueberry Cobblers! The prices are reasonable, they also serve breakfast on Sat. & Sum morns which is awesome is well!  Robin the waitress is a joy to have while visiting!"
"1","My husband & I went here based on the reviews from here. We were in Charlotte for our anniversary and I was eager to try the local cuisine. I like trying small businesses and supporting them. With that said...Mert's was disappointing and overpriced. The fried chicken was bland, you should not have to put salt on fried chicken. The Mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best. The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!!! Horrible!!! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food. It's too bad I have to leave this review because I love supporting small businesses and especially black operated small businesses. Yuck!"
"1","Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal, food and service, was mediocre at best. To tell the truth, the service ran along the lines of pretty poor. We sat outside and the tables around us were annoyed with the bad service too. Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to \""go away\"" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her.\n\nWe started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find \""tomatoes\"" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer.\n\nWe waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table. \n\nAfter finally chasing someone down inside we got our check. With all the options in the neighborhood to try we probably won't add this to our list of great places to dine."
"2","After eating a disappointing, overpriced dinner the night before, my group was thrilled to find this sweet spot in downtown Charlotte!\nWe loved the quirky decor and immediately felt the warm fuzzies for our energetic waitress.\nWe were there for breakfast, but I personally was excited to hear that there were meat and veggies choices available too.\nGood flavored coffee was a welcome beginning , as was the yummy cornbread and crunchy biscuits.\n5 stars would have been given , but some in our party said their omelette choices were just ok.\nMy non traditional meal of salmon patties, collard greens and home fries was yummy!  Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I look forward to a return to this place.  Egg rolls filled with collards and black eyed peas and roasted veggies are on my list of things to try next time.  Gourmet soul food at its best!"
"1","I really wanted to like this place.  It had cool old wood signs and their original menu on a chalkboard, and friendly welcoming staff.  The menu has a lot of good sounding items, but the problem for me was I was expecting some good Southern cookin with chicken fried chicken or chicken fried steak.  So, I went for the fried chicken breast and it was just blah, dry and no flavor.  The saving grace which earned the extra star was that the side veggies were good and the cornbread was delicious."
"2","This is the best soul restaurant!!! The soul rolls are a must have. The waitresses are so nice and helpful and are quick to fix a mix up.  I loved the place. Any time I'm in Charlotte, this is a must have!"
"1","The cornbread was the best part of the meal, all the other menu items I tried was sub-par."
"2","My buddy Bob and I were in town for a convention this week.  Wanted to go local and have a meal that I wouldn't get up in NJ.  Merts did not disappoint.\nIt's not upscale, fancy, yuppified, or pretentious.\nEverything was a little unique to Merts.\nWaitress sold us on her favorites which, for us, was dead on.  The beef ribs and pulled pork melt in your mouth delicious with an outstanding tomato and vinegar based sauce.\nSides of okra, collards, Mac & cheese paired well. The sampler platter was very unique for a BBQ joint and is a must to try if your are willing to try something new.\nThe Corn bread and sweet butter was a great compliment to the meet.  \nIt's half the price of Roosters up the street and you will not leave hungry.  The very next day we were craving for more."
"2","Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I used to live uptown and would come here for lunch often.  I'm not a cornbread fan but I do love their cornbread. \nI also finally had their chicken tenders over the weekend and they were excellent.  I debated between the salmon cakes or the chicken tenders and decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.\nI had the mac and cheese and collard greens as my accompaniments and I was pretty full, but couldn't take a doggie bag since I was headed to SMG for a movie :(\n\nThis is the place I try to take out-of-towners and point tourists towards since to me this is Charlotte cooking and it has a great location uptown on College."
"2","Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY."
"2","I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  Everything is fresh, delicious, and remarkably low-priced."
"2","Ok, just to dispel any misunderstandings, this isn't true \""soul food\"" - it's great southern cooking.\n\nWe have been here three times since living in Charlotte and continue to come back for more. The mac-and-cheese is to die for, and every entree we've had has been terrific. I usually get the fried chicken tenders but opted for the barbecue ribs last time I was here, and was not disappointed. The cornbread is a huge plus but is usually too much for me to finish. Shrimp and Grits is an all-time favorite for me as well. If you can, save room for dessert. If they have it, the german chocolate cake is a total win.\n\nGo for al fresco dining if you can (weather permitting) - nothing like sitting outside and watching the sites of Uptown Charlotte."
"2","Excellent! Home cooking, friendly service and the pies are amazing!!"
"1","I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6, I got 4 slices of skinny green tomatoes, deep fried and over battered.  Tried their fried chicken, it wsa crispy but why is the portion so small. The table cloth is grimy and sticky..\n\nTry a Waffle house and I think you'll have a better dining experience."
"2","Food was on point and very delicious,  however our waitress was NOT the deal. He wasn't very friendly and added extra food to the order, repetitive of things that I did order causing me to have lots of the same things.  He didn't explain how orders came and often heard us call him only to pause and glance in our direction. We were NOT rude or anything of that nature. Greens could have been a lil better instead of like leaves but other than that,  I loved it. I won't let that one black monkey stop my show! !! I will be back!!!!"
"2","This is my second visit to Mert's (the first time Yelp wouldn't let me be great and check in). They decor is artisy and eclectic and includes a diner style dessert counter. (My inner fatty girl rejoices) if you are on one of those \""starve myself of carbs because they are the devil\"" diets do yourself a favor and skip this place because the cornbread is a MUST! \n\nI got the fried jumbo chicken wings which were delicious, the greens, which were flavorful but not very juicy like I prefer mine. The only disappointment from my meal were my yams. Basically because I had more juice than potato :-( \n\nStaff was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be returning for some banana pudding."
"1","Service was great! Servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable. However, the food..... Sucked. The collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt. The corn bread (which is what they are known for) was extremely dry and tasted like it came out of a box. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated (granted we did have a party of 7) only to be disappointed. This was not good Soul Food at all."
"2","Deeeeeeelicious!  Split the pork BBQ plate w/collards & yams with a friend who got the salmon cakes.  Both were wonderful.\n\nWe're moving in as soon as possible.  Or at least going for breakfast tomorrow morning!"
"2","I thought I'd avoid the crowd by dining a little late but the place was PACKED! I love the look and feel of the restaurant although it was a bit warm inside. I asked for a table outside and had my pick...probably a little chilly for some but just right for me. \n\nSweet tea and a corn bread CAKE were brought out right away. It was the size of a small pound cake and I knew I was in for trouble! I ordered the salmon cakes, greens and mac & cheese. Salmon cakes had lost their crispness on the outside, but the flavor was delicious. The greens were leafy and large and JUST RIGHT! And god bless the mac & cheese. Oozing with buttery cheesy goodness and a touch of the topping that had baked up brown and I may as well have died and gone to heaven.\n\nOf course I could not finish all the food. But my server offered a box without my asking. Great food and great service."
