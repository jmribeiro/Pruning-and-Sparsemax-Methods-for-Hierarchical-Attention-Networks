"2","Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years."
"1","Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \""manager\"" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too."
"2","Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long."
"1","The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints."
"2","Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \n\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\n\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town."
"2","Picture Billy Joel's \""Piano Man\"" DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.\n\nIf you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.\n\nThe crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?\n\nDueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing!"
"1","Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager."
"1","Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it."
"1","I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""games\"", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets."
"2","Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it's hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone, it's nice to walk into one every once in a while."
"1","Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.\n\nFriday's is like the \""fine dining chain\"" for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...\n\n1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that.\n2.  I ordered one of their \""skinny margaritas\"", blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill.\n3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha!\n4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle.\n5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment.\n6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.  \n\nNever again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise..."
"2","Unos has been around for ever, & I feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80's. Honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick.\n\nIf you haven't died and he recently I ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good!\n\nThey have the best chicken salad wrap ever! I love that rap so much I want agreed to walk the south side River Trail from where the Steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because I knew that I could convince my boyfriend to go to Unos with me for lunch.  Full disclosure:  I made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch.\n\nListen... The food and pizza and service are very good, surprisingly so! I don't know why this place is not busier but next time you're down at the Waterfront please do consider dining here!"
"1","Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \n\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation."
"1","Our last few visits have left something to desire, One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,\n\nThe food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT, HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning."
"2","Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!"
"1","Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore."
"1","When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""Should be ready in a few days\"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""duke it over\"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?"
"1","My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's."
"1","Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?"
"2","I fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers! \n\nI tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream, their scoops are very generous!! \n\nMy bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for! We got 4 servings of ice cream for $10, which nowadays is a steal IMO! :) \n\nI'll definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week!"
"2","This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The \""flavor of the week\"" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer. Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's definitely worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.\n\nIf you want a real \""Kodak moment\""-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!"
"2","This is my go-to distributer. They have a great selection and lots of hard to find brews. I haven't noticed that it's any more expensive than going elsewhere but honestly if I don't buy here then I'm buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off. So any time I have a case of something I love I feel like I'm getting a bargain. The cold selection does suck so I try to plan ahead and have what I need already cold. Staff here are all very helpful- and will have recommendations if you ask."
"2","Love this beer distributor.  They always have what I'm looking for. The workers are extremely nice and always willing to help. Best one I've seen by far."
"1","Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return."
"1","I went there today! The cut was terrible! I have an awful experience. They lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head!"
"2","As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.\n\nThe new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.\n\nTasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.\n\n- written by a former junior high school daughter cashier"
"2","This shelter is fantastic and has generally very good, friendly people on staff.  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.\n\nWhen I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free, which was great, but the reason they don't get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me, and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby."
"1","Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy."
"2","Yes! Awesome soy cap, scone, and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read, and free WiFi with no login procedure."
"1","The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again."
"1","I've been here quite a few times, and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.\n\nEverytime I go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\n\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah."
"1","The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food. I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon. They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. I won't go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok. They didn't give any sauce. You have to ask for it. That sucks."
"2","I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough.\n\nI have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome."
"2","The first time I came here, I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad, I didn't come back for a year.\n\nI can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can't describe them.  Just get some.\n\nDo I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified, yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks, naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach's opening ceremony.\n\nJust go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it's easier that way."
"2","I'm a creature of habit--I've been getting a savory and sweet item each time I'm around the neighborhood. White lily cake is divine! Quiches always tasty. Macarons are alittle too sweet. I wish the cake slices weren't $4/pop. Otherwise, would be a regular here."
"1","I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better."
"2","We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the \""outdoor\"" dining area.  We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.  \n\nFor our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal."
"2","When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!"
"1","Overpriced, salty and overrated!!! Why this place is so popular I will never understand."
"2","Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch, brunch, or dinner, the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure, I've had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh, but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also, the desserts are mandatory!  \n\nThe duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.  \n\nA nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria."
"2","My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food."
"2","I am not a vegan and went there to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere. I must say the hipster 'tude of the place was intimidating at first, but it's super friendly and retro-feeling.  Servers were fairly friendly.  We had some great lattes and chai teas and chatted for a long time without being bothered.  Didn't try the food, but there were lots of vegeterian and vegan options."
"2","This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great, the heart was perfect, and he loved it!"
"1","It seems like every other time I take my pets to Point Breeze there is an unnecessary frustration.   From being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service I just keep hoping each time will be better.  Although I know they love animals I suspect they love money more.  Dr. Caroline. Simard is an excellent vet, but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious.   I'm a 40 year-old  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and I don't understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth."
"1","Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here."
"1","My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left."
"2","What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \n\""Would you care for some dessert?\"", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM."
"1","And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. \""But,\"" I said, \""the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist.\"" \""Oh,\"" the chick at the counter said, \""that's for Men's cuts.\"" Silly me. \n\nSo when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, \""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\"" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \""Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.\"" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? \""Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone.\"" \""Or I can send you a gift certificate.\"" \""Nope,\"" I said through clenched teeth, \""I won't be coming back.\""\n\nIt wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, \""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\"" \n\nThe search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!\n\nP. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased."
"2","Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!"
"1","The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \""get together\"" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!"
"1","Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \""deal\"" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar."
"1","I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \""hated\"" that jacket and that the liner was \""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\"" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place."
"2","Fun bar, and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes. The blue grass jam on Wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation. Decent beer prices, pretty good selection."
"1","Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return."
"2","First time customer today.  It is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great.  Large portions, fresh bread and cheap..."
"2","I went to a Bob Marley laser show as a 'favor' for my husband...  the lasers were really cool.  I would not recommend them if you are prone to migraines, or have a neuro disorder, such as seizures.\nI think if the music was more my taste, it would have been awesome."
"2","Love this place! I was visiting Pittsburgh from Houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum - or should I say museums. Coming from Houston where we have some pretty good museums, this was a pleasant surprise - really cheap considering you get both Art and Natural History.\nThe dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational.  The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs, Monets, Cezannes, etc.\nThe only exhibit I didn't much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about.\nAll in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh."
"2","Been there three times and each time it got better.  Most recent dinner was with a party of 14.  A large crowd for a smal place but they made it work.  Everyone was extremely pleased with their meal.  The lobster ravioli & salmon specials were top notch.  The service was even better than the food if that is possible.  Best restaurant in the burgh & it's BYOB to boot.  Make sure you have reservations."
"1","The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.\n\nOne plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. \""Need a car\"" haha some things about living in the hood just never change. \n\nWith this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change."
"1","I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly."
"2","Seattle may have just won the 2014 Super Bowl, but the Steelers still rock with six rings, Baby!!! Just stating what all Steeler fans know: a Steel Dynasty is still unmatched no matter what team claims the title of current Super Bowl Champs.. Go Steelers!!!"
"1","Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams \""this fish is not fresh\"". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back."
"2","Review #200\n\nI got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.\n\nThe sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:\n\nAll of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.\n\nThumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!\n\nIs the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)"
"1","This was my second visit and alas, my last. \n\nOur first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.\n\nIt was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was \""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\"" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert. \n\nOur first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1."
"1","BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs, arms, and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 8/10 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back."
"2","I had not been to Betos in many many years.  Boy has the place grown up.  Still the same pizza that you will either love or hate.\n\nThe Pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it.  Tastes really good.  \n\nI also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people.\n\n\nWas not to crowded, but full Saturday at lunch.\n\nHighly recommended."
"2","A different style (love or hate) pizza. A square cut thicker crust with cold shredded cheese on top. It's different enough that it is a good chance of pace to your standard pie."
"2","Great shop! Watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish!\n\nTried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside! Yum!"
"2","I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too."
"1","Agree with chaitiyana. This place is pretty bad. The food isn't fresh. They have a Buffet even for dinner. I stayed at Days Inn for 2wks here and was forced to eat here a few times. The mango lassi was good, the naans (when fresh) were good, but mostly it all stunk."
"2","got the buffet pizza was good they also give you free soup to ."
"2","I had a positive experience with this shop. I needed something framed at the last minute, and within extremely precise parameters (that weren't easy to abide by), and they not only got the work done correctly and on time, but at a reasonable price. \n\nThe staff is a little gruff, but not at all unfriendly, and I am happy to have found a local shop that I will return to."
"1","Cons:\n* Very cramped space, aisles are so narrow that you have to carry your case sideways.\n* Only a few items were priced with signs hanging above them.\n* No shopping carts.\n\nPros:\n* Decent selection\n* Chilled section"
"2","I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's, but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. \nThe beer cave is awesome. \nI'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though."
"2","Something different here.\n\nFood, schmood, go there and drink the beers from the beer cave.  I don't think you have to wait for the server to open your beer, they'll notice and charge your accordingly.  It's all walk in and self service beer, why don't more places do that?!\n\nMike"
"1","It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior, antique tin ceilings, a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D's at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers,  Both times I've eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place, but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango, map room, d's and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said, if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend, you could definitely do worse, but skip the boring food."
"2","Food is delicious and staff is very prompt.  \n\nThe one thing I absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is!!!  I was completely stunned and amazed when I walked in."
"2","I got two pairs of shoes fixed here recently and I was very pleased with the work done and the cost.  It is a great little business to have in the neighborhood! \nMake sure you call and check their hours... Saturdays are probably your best bet."
"2","BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on \""PA n'at with Dave and Dave\"" and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a \""Battleship\"" and it was literally 3 feet long, just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  \n\nIt's great, fast food.  I can't wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship."
"1","This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back."
"1","The worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.    Their watermelon mixed drink was very good though.  I won't be returning."
"1","Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans)."
"2","Great bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee!\nMy favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too.\nIf you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up, the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm."
"2","There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to. \n\nHaving moved from the south, I had to leave a woman I loved and strike out into all new territory. It was the end of a 2 year relationship, and I wasn't prepared to see just any old body after that. \n\nThen I found Nicolette at MCN. She's amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and AND she's great at her job. Also, the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price, so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck (like me,) you can see Jenn or Kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra.\n\nHowever, if you don't like dogs, be aware that Josie, the bulldog, is frequently around and about."
"1","I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, hoping I'd find a place to get my hair cut after moving to Pittsburgh from NJ. Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with, but I did not have a great experience. I'm a nurse who works mostly day shifts, and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep. \n\nNow, maybe a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn't asking for some trendy 'do that needed 3 different products, a round brush, and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh, and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn't entirely flattering because of it's blunt ends--- funny, I ended up with the same thing. \n\nThis experience has definitely made me decide never to go back, for $50 I expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment. Oh, and somewhere that isn't constantly pushing products."
"1","Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone"
"1","Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.  \n\nThe blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!"
"1","DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure."
"1","I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating, I could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! We sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. We waited too long for the waiter to initially great us, and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant, so this is the main reason for a 2, hopefully it's a rarity because the food was pretty good. I had the Cod sandwich , it was hot and tasty, probably one of the better fish sandwiches I've had. So it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important!"
"2","Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. (28X).  but i think i've found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle, they are shipped to Pittsburgh, old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm.\n\nthey also run the inclines, which are pretty cool if not old."
"2","Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or \""PAT\"") operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.\n\nI've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (\""Miss Pat\""--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a \""free\"" bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.\n\nThe system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.\n\nThe route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The \""oughts\"" and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three \""busways,\"" transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the \""T\"" or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a \""smart card\"" digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.\n\nOne especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.\n\nThe Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years."
"2","The store is small, but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I was particularly excited to find middle eastern chili sauce and chocolate covered Turkish delights."
"2","Boy do I miss Primate Bros.  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out 'n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70's).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their T-shirts...but alas...left it with a native friend (she also liked it alot) in Koh Samui Thailand."
"2","Salami and cheese is so amazing. Best food in the city!"
"1","It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. \n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \""Pittsburgh\"" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. \n\nAfter being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.\n\nThe sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. \n\nIf you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \""Pittsburgh\"" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return."
"2","a classic. nothing else to say"
"1","Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food."
"2","When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location."
"1","I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha."
"1","This place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here. If that experience is what your looking for, please visit. If you're looking for a tasty meal, go somewhere else. 5 stars for history, 0 for food quality and flavor."
"2","Awesome tortillas, awesome salsa, pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican, but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta, but this is the best one I've found in the 'burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh, but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store."
"2","Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here, so I did. Pretty good. Loaded more than I'm used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It's fun to watch people order tacos here, this is a real taste of Mexico, and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren't afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue. \n\nThat chinese food truck across the street though.... it's good, but way Americanized."
"2","Yes, I went and had the tacos. YES, the lengua tacos. YES, I KNOW!!! They were good. Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk, along with any kind of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck, you can get those here, too. I'm not sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope, pretty sure they've got it all. Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm and tender, then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story."
"2","love the lobster roll.  buttery delicious stuff.  the crab/spin/artichoke dip was also yummy.  i'll go back and try other dishes.  so far so good"
"2","I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P"
"1","I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought \""Eh, what the hell.\""\n\nWe came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.\n\nI did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.\n\nI won't be back."
"2","The people aren't lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone."
"1","There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. \nThe fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. \nThe Mussels were OK. \nBut the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. \nThe New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. \nNo, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill."
"1","Prime time location, and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \""lobster roll\"" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!!"
"1","If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. \n\nI didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.\n\nSpeaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! \n\nWorst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. \n\nI'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!"
"1","Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement..."
"1","WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better ."
"1","I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!"
"1","I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone."
"2","I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""unsavories\"" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all.\nKeep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way. \nYou will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!"
"1","Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage."
"2","The Sicilian Pizza is huge, tasty, crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.\n\nMy only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.  I want my pizza piping hot, almost burning the roof of my mouth!\n\nThe overall taste made up for the temperature difference, and I was happy with the overall experience.  Both the cooks and the waitress were friendly."
"1","This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.\n\nTwo of us ate the gyro platter which comes with: \nhummus (watery) \npita (store bought) \ngyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small) \nGreek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing) \ngrape leaves (vegetarian but quite good) \nand rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor). \n\nOverall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint. \n\nI also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again."
"1","There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad."
"1","Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""the manager\"" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it."
"2","Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals, wood, fiber, mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced). They do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers."
"2","This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I found a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it's good enough to have its own review.  PLUS, my gal from China Express (now closed, was downtown) cooks there, so I had to make it happen.\n\nThis place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I've ever tried is the chicken on a stick, and really, it's all I need.  these little thingers are delicious, and they're only $3.  \n\nThey have two different sauces to dump on it, and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it's wrapped in foil, and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins, as they're messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples, I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won't regret it."
"1","I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!"
"1","Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient, still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing!"
"2","The ladies here are very sweet and talented. We had 2 bridal gowns that needed a bustle and minor alterations. The prices are very reasonable, the dresses came back perfect,  and the length in time getting them back was very fast. Is recommend this shop for any and all alterations."
"2","I began attending the Midwife Center for well-woman care about three years ago, then chose the Midwife Center as my care provider when I became pregnant with my daughter a year and a half ago.  I can't say enough good things about this place, from the inviting atmosphere to the knowledgeable and supportive midwives to the very helpful nurses and lactation consultant.  My daughter was born in the Forest Room, and it was everything I'd hoped for.  One of the saddest parts about leaving Pittsburgh for me this past summer, when we had to move for my husband's job, was having to say goodbye to the Midwife Center.  I am hoping to find someplace half as wonderful in our new city."
"1","The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for."
"2","4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them."
"2","The steaks here are very good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris."
"2","I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)"
"1","Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. \n\nI have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same."
"2","My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!"
"2","So fun to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white, milk, and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate, but only because I didn't know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.  I didn't try the hot chocolate, but I hear it's a must-have.\n\nWhile we walked around the small store, three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn't realize until after I left that there's a sign asking patrons not to take pictures. Ooops!  But no one said anything and they were polite, so thumbs up for the service here."
"2","Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop."
"2","I stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff. The place felt clean, up-to-date, and comfortable. All the staff were friendly and everything was easy, from check-in to check-out. \n\nThe rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished, and the 3rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use, which seemed like a nice thought. \n\nI'd stay there again for sure."
"1","Ok, but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn't have a credit card so at first they said I couldn't check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast, and the shuttle refused to pick us up because \""roads were too bad\"" We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman with me, only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn't help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there, we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it, driving in the opposite direction, away from us. I cannot believe how rude they were"
"1","Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile ."
"2","Excellent food, nice beverages, more than fair prices, & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We'll be back. Very pleased."
"1","Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in."
"1","Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would."
"2","We showed up after a Pirates game to keep the buzz rolling, and this place did the trick. 22-ounce Yuenglings for $4? My kind of place. There were plenty of sports on the tellie, some really kickin' alt rock music, and one of the friendliest crowds of all time. That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book."
"2","My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference."
"2","This place was noted as a \""must visit\"" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation, I was told \""head to the back to where the cheese is\"". So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat's all."
"2","The cheese counter and \""Dear Heart\"" really are treasures.  They have all manner of fancy aged gruyeres, tons of olives, and even some sort of disgusting concoction called \""pepperoni cheese\"".  In any case, the place is all kinds of old-world beautiful.  Shelf after shelf of yummy goods, Italian imports...yum."
"2","My family has been coming to Penn Mac for as long as I can remember. My parents make monthly trips to stock up on their very large array of cheeses. The prices are fantastic. For example, parmigiano reggiano at Whole Foods is 19.99 per lb; at Penn Mac it is 14.99 per lb. The service is great, the array of products are huge, and as stated before, the prices are great. \n\nMy favorite products to purchase are:\n\nAll cheeses\nDeli meats\nCanned tomatoes\nPasta\n\""00\"" flour\nCashews\nOlive oil"
"2","Unlike many historic theaters across the country, the Harris Theater has been lovingly restored, and is actually a great place to watch a movie.  In a past life, it showed porno movies.  Now it screens eclectic art-house films and other smart selections programmed by PGH Filmmakers.\n\nLocated on Liberty Street downtown, the theater is easily accessible via public transportation.  The concessions are cheap, and the seats are comfy.  What more could you ask for?"
"1","After two visits to this theater this week, I want to yellp:  turn up the volume! Or seriously look into purchasing new audio equipment, easier said than done, I know. I felt as though I could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason, but the point is that I was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view."
"2","I adore Prestogeorge. They've got a ton of freshly roasted coffees, which is great. Also? Lots and lots of loose-leaf tea. I may be willing to admit a small tea addiction, and this is one of my favorite places to try something new. I've given coffee and tea from here as gifts and they've always been well-received; it's especially nice that I can get whatever grind I'd like.\n\nThere's also a smallish selection of gourmet foods, and my husband likes some of the dips. Then again, he likes most dips.\n\nMy favorite, favorite thing here, though, is the staff. I always end up stopping here and buying SOMETHING when I'm in the Strip, because they're amazingly friendly and more than willing to help with any questions. When people go on and on about \""back in the day, the mom and pop stores really took care of you blah blah fishcakes,\"" this is the kind of service I imagine."
"2","I liked the decor of the place.  When I lived in Pittsburgh 3 years ago, I was just out of college with no money and didn't care what I ate.  So I spent a lot of time eating bar food, pizza, and $1 pierogies.  I never knew there were \""fancy\"" restaurants until I returned this week for work!\n\nI got the salad with pears & gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese.  I also had the octopus appetizer as a meal - I was surprised, it's much chewier than I expected.  But the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor.  The fruity sorbet was good as well.  \n\nI though the service was great and the waiters didn't laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu.  They were more than willing to explain!"
"2","Get the pasta trio, you won't regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we're seated in 5 minutes."
"1","My girlfriend REALLY hyped this place up but I ended up spending $110 on a terrible meal I couldn't even eat. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (Waitress's favorite) and it was disgusting. The sauce was VERY over powering and it was drenched in it. If that wasn't bad enough the Chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it. I ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price. Won't be going back here..."
"1","Minimalist happy hour.  Bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). Ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that's what we wanted to do. Chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  Prices too high for strip district beer.  Smelly.  Upstairs looks like it's a club at night.  Rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  Good for a quick beer and that's about it."
"2","Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service."
"2","The reason for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can't go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot."
"2","Staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn cool.  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic.  If you're driving, parking is conveniently located across the street, though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building (or maybe I'm just more obtuse than the average parker).  \n\nThe hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks (the house-made chips are addictive) and enjoy a nice drink.  And if you have the great pleasure of having Sam as your bartender, you're definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs.  Just make sure you bring up Justin Bieber--she really loves that little fella...."
"2","Great location, Front Desk Staff were very personable. Be prepared to hear fireworks from PNC Park it is right across the river. There is a parking deck across the street with very reasonable rates. My husband and I had a great time here."
"2","My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far."
"1","We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.\n\nThe location was good, although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that our shower wasn't clean. The walls in the rooms were thin; we could hear our neighbor's dog barking, as well as other people using their showers/bathrooms.\n\nOverall, for what we needed the room for (sleeping after a show), it was fine. But with the thin walls, expensive parking, and the dirty bathroom, i'd never stay at this place again. I've had better experiences in smaller, cheaper hotels."
"1","My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal."
"1","Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money."
"1","I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room, I was expecting a LOT more for my buck, maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn't have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid, it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.\n Usually when you pay top tier rates, I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly, didn't get that here, I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.\n My wife would probably give it 4 star just for the shower head, it was pretty amazing, but when that is the highlight, I don't think there is value here."
"2","I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river, near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.\n\nCheck in was pleasant as I've always experienced here, staff were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nRooms were clean but could use a bit of updating; finding a convenient outlet to charge my phone was a bit of a challenge. \n\nOne odd note, you must use your room key in order to turn the lights on in the room. There is a slot for that purpose just as you enter so, take my advice and get at least 2 room keys.\n\nThe restaurant attached to the hotel, a lovely, fine dining establishment called the Old Fishmarket, is slated to close at the end of October, 2014...in it's place is going to be a restaurant called \""Bill's Burgers & Grill\"" I hear it is good, but we shall see next time I stay here.\n\nThere is the option of self-parking or valet parking on site at the hotel."
"2","A friendly place with great seafood.  It is cash only. The clam chowder was meaty and creamy.  The onion rings were crispy and so was the fish. A nice place to see local flair"
"1","This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. \n\nThe food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. \n\nI did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!"
"1","A friend of mine and I thought we would meet for lunch one Wednesday. I'm a fan of Thai food so I thought we would give the Lemon Grass Cafe a try. We arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly. That was the best part of the experience. It took an hour to receive our food. AN HOUR on a busy Wednesday lunch break. There was no sorry, we're working on it ... etc. No explanation at all was given. The food was meh. I've had much better. I would not recommend this place to anyone. \n\nAs we were walking out a lady was waiting for her takeout order, which she called ahead about. And it wasn't ready yet and she had been waiting over 20 minutes for it. Terrible terrible customer service."
"2","Wow, I'm surprised no one has left a review for this place yet. I've been here quite a number of times and I've never been disappointed. Service is good and the food is wonderful. This is the closest thing to getting Chinese food from D.C.  You definitely have to get the general tso's chicken. I drove all the way to get some food from here during last years horrible winter storm. When you have a craving, you have a craving."
"2","Great spot for weird or obscure parts, general maintenance items, and to  borrow a wrench or two.  Gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle.   I remember going there for my first time in the early 90's and it hasn't changed in almost 20 years."
"2","great pizza from the graziano family. \n\ngreat subs, tasty sauces, nice crust, lots o beer.\n\nno complaints what-so-ever"
"1","The last 3 or so times I've visited, they've been closed 15 minutes early.\n\nOn the plus side, I've discovered I look damn good with longer hair."
"2","I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars. \n\nI usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! \n\nThis restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan."
"2","I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town."
"2","First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad.\nThat said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA."
"2","If there were an option to give an extra star for a \""special\"" experience, I would surely do so for Golden Razor. I must confess that I have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match. Well but it did meet its match out here. The shave out here gives me a sense of hope against the injustice of my beard. Also I have been lucky to taste some home made lemoncello from the house of the master himself!"
"2","I just moved to the area and went here for the first time the other day. Tomaso did a great job! I high recommend this place."
"2","If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.        \n\n Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset."
"2","Tram has great Pho, and enough of it to feed all of Pittsburgh when the next fake Armageddon rolls around."
"1","I only had Pho so I can't judge the rest of the food, but the Pho was the worst I've ever had. Biggest let down ever, as I drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of Pho at what's apparently the best place in Pittsburgh, but  left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water, and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic."
"2","Pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess, but there are little gems around town that I can always find myself going back to. Its not about amazing food, its not about cheap food, its about good value, and thats what Trams is. Their spring rolls might not be something to write home about, but the coconut vermicelli is great, and something you are seldom to find elsewhere, in fact, i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences. vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here, and a nice sugary-caffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed. Go to trams! get some noodles n'at!"
"2","Tessaros has a full menu, but if you go there you need, no you must order a burger.   They have the very best restaurant burgers I have ever eaten.   Not greasy, great taste, and they grill them right there in the bar.\n\nDon't miss out on the best burger of your life."
"1","In theory, Tessaro's is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice, it's not very pleasant to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.  \n\nThey don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams \""we have fries here!\"" Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?\n\nI've come to believe that everyone at Tessaro's is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away. But you  keep going back. \n\nHave some pity for the poor cursed Tessaro workers, and just go up the street to BRGR, or downtown to Winghart's."
"2","Loved this place.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  My cousin told me that they had the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Well, Ria, you were right!   Done to perfection, exactly the way I asked for it.  Not only was the burger great, the potato salad with came with it was just wonderful.  I think  Tessaro's will be on our list of go to places from now on!"
"1","I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""meat,\"" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""amazing.\""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades."
"2","Tessaro's, I kept hearing, was the best burger joint in the burgh. The award, in my opinion, is still up in the air. I have quite a few more places to check out!\n\nA huge plus to Tessaro's for their kitchen! Wow is that thing small. And the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window. AHHH MAZING! I also heard Tessaro's butchers their own meat on site. I love hearing this. \n\nTessaro's is definitely worth checking out. The lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close. Perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour. Oh, and they aren't open on Sundays so steer clear of that day."
"2","A ton of people told me to try this place, so I went.\n\nIt's very different than most restaurants. The place is old school, but so friendly. My pal and I had a great time! We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations; but you will not find any of that here. They are simple burgers that have amazing taste. I repeat, do not have your hopes up for something that will dazzle you, but the quality is great. The meat was awesome, cooked to perfection. There was nothing gross about the meat, no crunchy or fatty bites. \n\nGet the home fries.... Old school Heinz bottles where you have to hit the 57. \n\nThis place is worth trying. It seemed like a type of clientele that have been going there for years. Time for the younger hipsters to revive it?\n\nTry it."
"1","I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight, however, was just awful. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \""homemade\"" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated."
"2","Free wing Fridays... oh yeah.  I don't even like wings usually, but Silky's knows how to cook 'em so they don't taste fatty.  Get a side of Atomic sauce, which is flavorful as well as hot.  I'd buy it by the bottle if I could.  The menu is huge, and everything I've had has been good.  I always get the home fries on the side, which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses, too.  Would be five stars if it had decent air conditioning--in the summer, sitting inside is painful."
"2","Comfortable, friendly, affordable.  Nice stop before an evening out.  I need to head there primetime to assess the evening vibe.  Will be back."
"2","This place is the real stuff. Just moved from portland OR. and its the only place that reminds me of home. Great food, great drinks, and great peeps. If you really wont to experience Bloomfield to its fullest, two words.......Sunday Funday. Check it out and you wont be disappointed. #gopitt"
"1","the waitresses are salty.\nthe food is mediocre (at best).\nthe place is a total dump.\n\nhowever, it's open late, and the cook with the mustache is rad.  also, you meet the funniest people ever there."
"1","Disappointing.  The food was below average and the service was ok.  We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver.  Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best.  Wine selection is very weak.  The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality."
"2","I haven't found Thai food that blew me away in Pittsburgh, but the waiter here was incredibly friendly, and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty."
"1","I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:\n\na) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town\n\nb) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths\n\nThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed. \n\nOn the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.\n\nThe takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.\n\np.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality."
"1","A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to."
"2","If you get nothing else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. \n\nI just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.\n\nThey were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend's and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own! \n\nAs we rolled out of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!"
"2","This place never fails! Curry is amazing. I always get the red bean curry. The service is always fast and courteous. Perfect to sit in and done or to-go. Its BYOB so feel free to bring a beer or wine bottle."
"2","Cute place...\nI went here after a kickball game with some of my team members.  The staff were fantastic.  I called to make a reservation and they were very nice.  They also called back to make sure it was ok for us to sit in the bar.  \n\nUpon arrival the bartender was very pleasant.  She showed me to the table which was marked reserved.  \n\nShe took drink orders then food orders.  My guests said the food was good but I didn't have anything.\n\nThere are TVs all around the bar and some games to play as well.\n\nThis is a little gem in the South Hills!"
"1","Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait, she forgot the taco shells, when she finally got back , she brought pita bread instead, I corrected her she appologized and fixed it. The cooked meat was bland , no seasoning, like they used to have.wifes steak was overbooked and dry.were looking for a new place now."
"1","I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest, had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city, then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me."
"1","I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste."
"2","THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!"
"2","My favorite pizza in the city. Hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight. One of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door, what more do you need?"
"1","I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to find a loop in PGH that doesn't!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria."
"1","First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one."
"2","Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.  \n\nThe pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil, olives, cheeses, Hoummus Dip, Baba Ghannouj, deserts, Halva, Specialty Pita Pies.  \n\nGood food and friendly service."
"1","Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""Hello\"" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled."
"1","So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don't know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4 \""Chinese\"" pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my \""Chinese\"" pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I'm served one and it wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy's but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out; but only seem to notice on your way out!"
"2","I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into."
"2","This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh."
"1","Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said \""i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.\"" We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15, so we walked back in and were seated right away.  \n\nFood was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.\n\nIf you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place."
"1","I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return."
"1","Just way to expensive for what it is. It's good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good, but not at that price and if I would've been told it was that much (was a special) I would've passed. Service was fine, but not attentive and slow, as well. Just so many other good Italian places in the area for half the price. Eggplant parm was enjoyable."
"1","I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now, even though the seats are fully occupied\nIt doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine, it is very chinese. And i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant. The sushi is not even firmly made\n\nI am not saying the food is bad, it is actually alright\n\n\nBut they have a great interior and place"
"1","I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  \n\nI figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man, was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor. \n\nSpoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California, I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday, I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.\n\nThe service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise, I really wouldn't recommend this place to other people."
"1","Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it's to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.  \n\nThe \""presses\"" are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn't know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.\n\nEven Burger King doesn't microwave their breakfast!"
"1","This should say it all: we found a dress we loved, it was in our price range, but...we didn't return because of the customer service\n\nI suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress, but we just didn't want that negative experience to taint our wedding. It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth, very accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren't ready to buy the dress, it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We're talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn't say no, we didn't say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren't ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy, and just wanted to think about it one more time. It's a purchase that costs thousands of dollars; shouldn't you as the bride be able to take your time?\n\nAnne Gregory is probably the only shop in town worth going to for higher-end, couture dresses. But we've been to nice boutiques across the country and this was the only one that gave us the huffy attitude you historically associate with those types of places. Disappointing.\n\nA few practical notes:\n- They don't allow pictures. Some shops do, some shops don't.\n- I think there's a private lot but if you end up parking in the strip mall parking lot next door or on the street, the spaces are metered so bring your quarters.\n- always judge for yourself...to get a sense of their collection you can go to their facebook page and see what dresses they've actually sold. take care not to confuse the posts they make of other wedding dresses and pictures of dresses by actual customers."
"2","The staff and the craft brew selection is great. With games, dart boards and a pool table, the KP is a great local hangout. \n\nLinda"
"1","Boring pretentious mall with old dated stores"
"1","Racist mall management team same team that ran century 3 mall in to the ground stay away nothing good comes out this place"
"1","Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said \""You get body waves?\"" Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm \""wouldn't soak in\"" on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, just as a side note."
"2","Great products and Katie has been the best!"
"1","Internet Connection  = $60 \nWi-Fi router = $120 \nDaily internet pass = $4.95\n\nLosing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.\n\n$4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.\n\nIf you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else."
"2","They're a great local alternative to Starbucks, and they make kickass drinks! I've had mochas here, hot and cold, and chai tea lattes here, hot and cold. All were delicious, about the same price as you would find at Starbucks, but they have those cute little stickers for decorating your cup and I'm all about the stickers. They're usually seasonally themed and are always adorable. It's the little things, people."
"2","I was walking around and decided to try this place out. I asked for a recommendation on a type of ground coffee to take home. The ladies where very helpful and knowledgable. I love the coffee. Thank you."
"2","Great place to study considering I've spent entire afternoons and evenings there cramming for exams. The staff is really friendly and if you get a ceramic mug refills for coffee are free!"
"2","I don't normally come to this laundromat, but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and I was getting desparate.  Although parking can be a bit of a pain, I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin' 50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working great.  It's air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah, and they have a change machine that apparently takes 20, 10, 5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again, I will be coming here."
"1","Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was \""very expensive.\""  He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it, but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won't be back."
"1","I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go."
"2","pretty good food, fantastic atmosphere, slightly overpriced, but not unreasonable for the quality and atmosphere"
"1","Hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh. Appalling \nservice, I went there with 6 people, restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by. The lounge was empty, was there from 8-11 she didn't check on us once, we had to flag her down , complained to the manager with no response. NYC prices as well, very embarrassed for the big burrito company."
"2","This is a better than average- let's say very solid-  sushi restaurant.  \n\nWe had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses.  But strangely the little bites never added up to feeling super full (which could be a good thing, but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isn't really the perfect end to omakase).  \n\nThe miso black cod was excellent, the sashimi was well executed, and clearly the chef had many, many years of traditional sushi training.  But for some reason my socks just weren't blown off.  More sushi and sashimi could have done the trick.\n\nOn the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable (which come from the restaurant downstairs- Soba).\n\nGreat atmosphere, attentive service and will def. go back.  At the same time, I'm open to finding alternatives in Pittsburgh (too optimistic?)\n\nAnd Dr. Freddie Fu is a fan (see autographed picture on sushi bar).  Not sure what this means, but maybe if I return I will be further enlightened."
"2","Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, I'm never completely satisfied when I leave.  Let's start with the good:\n\nThey have great quality sushi.  They have interesting taste combinations.  The decor is fun, especially if you sit in the \""traditional\"" seating area where you don't actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner, kudos to you).  \n\nBut, the portions are small, and every time we've eaten here, we come away with the sense of, \""great meal, but holy moly.  Dunno if it was $XXX good.\""  We'll continue to come, but probably only if someone else is paying.  In the meantime, it's off to Tamari we go."
"1","Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.\n\nOn a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.\n\nShe was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.\n\nShe return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.\n\nOther waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.\n\nWe waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?"
"2","No complaints about this place. I tend to gravitate towards this place mid afternoon with my laptop...love the vibe here. Outdoor patio or, NICE window seating upstairs. Creative menu as well. Check it out!"
"2","We went to Harris Grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of town-and it was fun! The menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining. The food and drinks are moderately priced, and there is a nice selection of brews.\n\nWhat we had:\n\nTurkey Burger-fabulous-we agreed this was the best thing we had ( I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good)\n\nFlat Iron Pork-I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak-this was ok but I wouldn't get it again.\n\nSome Spicy Chicken sandwich-Pretty good-paled in comparison to the turkey burger\n\nTots-Delicious\n\nBeer-good! (duh)\n\nOther:\nService-Fab!\n\n2 Patios-front and back"
"1","Overall a decent yet confusing experience...\nPros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things, including shuttle rides.\nCons: Extremely inconsistent room cleaning service! If you're staying for an extended period of time, they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is, they don't show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office, sometimes twice before it's cleaned. Also, someone in our  building had $1,900 stolen out of her drawer, and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check, but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn't stay here again...if you do, make sure that you use the safe provided in the room, and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself."
"1","Since my return to Pittsburgh, I have been to the \""new\"" Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I'm in the neighborhood shopping.  \n\nToday I went for a late lunch.  Honestly, there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was pretty chewy.  Probably should have gotten a salad.  \n\nI'm hoping that I just caught them on a bad afternoon."
"1","I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.  \n\nMost recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen.  \n\nSee you in another five years."
"2","I got a groupon for Dean of Shadyside for hairline highlights, deep conditioning masque, and a hair cut for $35.  I had never been, but I gave it a try.  The groupon was for a level 1 stylist, and I had Erika.  She was pretty great!  I've never had highlights before, and she helped me figure out what would look good.  My highlights look great, the cut looks great, she did exactly what I wanted her to do!  I never make hair appointments far in advance, but I pre-booked my next appointment!!!  I would highly recommend this place, and I recommend Erika as well!"
"1","Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd give it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish."
"1","Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!"
"2","First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously, this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however, it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells."
"2","You can speak to maurice about adding brewskis to the \""make your own six ~pack\"" if one you want isn't there! ;)"
"1","I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something."
"2","Food: very good, seasonal menu with at least 3 vegetarian friendly entrees when I was there (soups weren't veg-friendly), all three entrees we ordered, particularly the gnocchi, were excellent, house dressing is good too\n\nDrinks: full liquor selection and good beer choices too\n\nAtmosphere: we sat outside, and the patio is great, unique arrangement, feels very European\n\nService: prompt, friendly, overall very good\n\n(+): connected to Creamery upstairs, so if they run out of a specific desert, always great options to bring back to your table\n\n(-): could have used more bread, both in the basket and refilled more often"
"1","My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night."
"1","Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling \""Hey!\"" until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare.\nWell, needless to say, we didn't go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers."
"2","Never had any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem. They make the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy, just the right amount of saltiness, and just right for sopping up whatever's left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty amazing.  A great neighborhood standby."
"1","I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me sad to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""we have never had a complaint before\"" and \""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants."
"1","They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible."
"1","Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only."
"2","Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. \n\nThe seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's."
"1","Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe."
"2","I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"
"1","I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place."
"2","We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good, and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty consistent as well. They even called me back once to double check something on the order. That was really nice. Delivery times are always good, and they're very fast on slow days. Meals in the restaurant or also high-quality. My wife and I have probably eaten here 40 times in the last five years."
"2","Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  \n\nMy husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""al dente\"" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree."
"1","This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back."
"1","Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, \""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!\"", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  \n\nI will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself."
"1","Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion, that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect, courtesy and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  This was not the case.  I won't rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were given a certificate in our package for a free, fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn't really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'  When we picked up the second cake, again, in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude, cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else."
"1","There were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made, and I was the only person in line and couldn't get a single person to take my order.  Walked out and got faster service at Panera, which had a line out the door.\n\nOh well."
"1","Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \""how's it going\"", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""busy\"", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist."
"2","They take great care of our pets here. We rarely have much of a wait, and all of the staff are courteous and talented in handling and caring for pets. All of the vets we have met with were professional, friendly, and very capable."
"2","Excellent food with great service."
"1","Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable."
"2","Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee's & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don't know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool!"
"1","This hotel is in need of a renovation. This becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms, which have fixtures and mildew growth both from the seventies. I've stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed.\n\nI could have done without the Sleep Number bed, but that's probably more of a personal preference than anything. However, it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves. Apparently it used to be a Marriott some time ago - I'm guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to Marriott's standards.\n\nThe continental breakfast was a crime. $12 for buffet style eggs (from a bag no less), sausage, french toast, and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable. Passing on this gastronomic atrocity, I decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two 4 oz. yogurts (only option is Strawberry Banana? Really?).\n\nAt least there was a pretty nice pool where we could... oh, closed for private party. Just as well.\n\nThankfully this was a business trip and the client is paying expenses, otherwise I might have actually felt upset."
"1","Waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before 1pm from Conventional center to hotel from 12:40 to 1:00 pm. No bus showed up, I called Front desk, they told me be patient.  I waited and called them again around 1:30pm, they hang up my phone after I explained the purpose of the phone call. I called them third time around 1:35pm, no response.  Hope they will improve quality of their service."
"1","Perhaps it was an off night, but we were really disappointed in our take-out. My husband's pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don't know what it was. His Gen. Tso's chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. In the past it has been good food."
"2","I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter, Walmart, and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks, it's very conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn't on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont, this is probably the best place to go."
"1","Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a \""give me 20 minutes\"" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing."
"1","Get your wallet ready, the prices are crazy high!"
"1","Will never come here again!\n\nMy cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.\n\nWhen we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?\n\nNo. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude. \n\nWe were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.\n\nLuckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility."
"2","Great place! Good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic! We had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed. You won't be disappointed!"
"2","Had a rare only person in the house night, so I decided to treat myself.   \n\nI have passed by the Panda for years, and have always wanted to stop by, but my wife is very picky about Chinese food.   With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.\n\nI stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)\n\nThere were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.\n\nI love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that spicy, to appeal to a wider audience. \n\nI ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.\n\nIt came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.\n\nI got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!\n\nIt was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!\n\nBe mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!"
"1","Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded."
"2","Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  Also turns out it's well worth the drive.\n\nThe Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)\n\nWe started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.\n\nI had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made entirely of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Sp\u00e4tzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up well the next day, also--there was a lot of it.\n\nShe had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.\n\nAn older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.\n\nIt is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly."
"2","Fabulous place!!!   Went during Queens Feast Restaurant week and it was very organized and accommodating . Food and staff could not be better! Definitely will come back!"
"1","We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.\n\nAs far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.\n\nI just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.\n\nAs far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward."
"2","Great customer service. \nConvenient location. \nLarge assortment of games which is appreciated but the prices are a bit high.\nMinus the prices, I dig it."
"1","The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.  \n\nI brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.\n\nThey assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done.  I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more."
"2","My wife and I came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress.  Our salesman, Antwan, was interested in helping us get the right bed, not the most expensive one.  We ended up purchasing one, had it delivered and put into place the next day.  Been sleeping great since then.  Recommend checking them out when your in the market for a new mattress."
"1","Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember"
"1","I have been a long time fan but after having a issue with an item I purchased online this Christmas I will not be shopping here again. I tried to take a item back with the packing slip that came on the item, the associate told me I was unable to do the return with the packing slip but she could do it if I had the email confirmation.. I didn't have it on my phone so I went.. I found the email sent it back to my phone and tried the return again.. todays associate told me I could not do the return with the confirmation email but needed the packing slip.. which I could not find at the time. I asked to speak with the manager on duty which the associate called.. Valencia the manager on duty would not come up to speak with me but told the associate that they couldn't do the return.. I still have this 100.00 worth of stuff I don't need.. I would not recommend anyone from purchasing from Kmart!"
"1","Bought an item from there, didn't notice it was an open item until i checked out. Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it. I never dropped it, i brought it back to them in the same condition they sold it to me as.  Then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition. But they sure sold it to me. BUYER BEWARE."
"1","This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden, but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone."
"2","Great service - very quick, definitely use the coupons - and the evaluation was honest and fair - and no pressure is applied - I would go back again"
"2","Arrived around midnight and the front desk was ready for us, check in was quick and we were able to turn in. The room was clean, bed comfy, the desk was huge...but the bathroom was small. Breakfast in the morning was very convenient, several choices, and the coffee hit the spot."
"1","Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! \nWe purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business."
"2","For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!\n\nWhat do I mean \""for an IHOP\""?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.\n\nWe're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're funny as hell.\n\nFor as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.\n\nThe dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a place for breakfast, but not much else."
"1","On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with."
"1","Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.\n\nI had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me \""I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you.\"" So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.\n\nFunny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.\n\nAlso, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have. \n\nFor those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer."
"1","Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right."
"2","I love Al Mike's. The restaurant is hidden in the beautiful First Ward neighborhood. They've got great food, a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere. I typically get the blue cheese burger, while my boyfriend loves to get the London broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard. The fries and onion rings are delicious too. Plus, it's non-smoking, which I LOVE. I just wish it stayed open later."
"2","This was bar food heaven. Looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. \n\nWaiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \""What It Is\"". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed."
"2","In 79 reviews, no one has given this place below 3 stars.  That should tell you all you need to know.  Consistently good bar food in a quiet, pub-like environment. Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.\n\nIf I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control."
"2","Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \""what it is.\""  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!\n\nWhile the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure."
"2","Great place tucked away in 4th ward. You'd never know it was there. Only caveat is that parking is near-impossible. Strict street parking rules make it tough to come here if you're driving. \n\nLondon broil Sandwhich was clutch. Good ambiance as well. \n\nHope to return soon."
"2","Had a great time at Al Miike's this week. The Food was greatl The locals and the staff or great for company. The bartender suggested Today's Special, meatloaf, mash, and gravy. Awesome comfort food to go along with the warm welcoming locally owned and managed bar and restaurant. If you haven't been to Al Mikes, you are truly missing out on an amazing all around warm neighborhood tavern experience. Charlotte's version of Cheers... where you can feel like, \""everybody knows your name.\"""
"1","I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""crab\"" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon."
"2","From the outside you see a quiet street with some couples strolling along hand-in-hand.  As you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz.  Is that a bar?  What's going on in there?\n\nOnce the door is open you are hit with a wave of laughter, glasses clinking, and the sound of people talking.  I think this is going to work out just fine.\n\nThe Great:\n+ The bartender/host/server/manager/busboy.  This guy was friendly, funny, and helpful.  Quick to smile and full of insight, he is awesome.\n+  A great selection of local beers.\n+  Cool location and extremely cozy inside.\n\nThe Average:\no  The only food we ordered was a crab soup - which was completely average.\n\nWith that said, this place would be my local watering hole if I lived in the 4th Ward.  Well done!"
"2","Might not be the easiest location to visit or see, but it's a good option because of the people that work here.  Tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this Showmars location, but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place.  The servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you, call you by name, and ask how your work day is going.\n\nI take my lunch around 1pm so WAY after the lunch rush, but I can imagine this place being super busy.  There are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast - with daily specials.\n\nSuper affordable and predictable, you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly - especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch.\n\nNow, this place is pretty practical if you work Uptown and can walk here for lunch.  Probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere... even if you park on the street at a metered spot."
"2","This is a Beautiful Museum\n\nThe space is used well!  Like a Maze, though an easy maze as you wind through the exhibits.  The Cotton Gin was my favorite part of the museum. The Barbers chairs are cool too!  There is a Small theater also, which plays an introduction to the exhibit."
"2","Interesting museum in uptown. From California so it is always interesting to learn about the history of the south. Great family location for an outing to make the day also educational. Brought my daughter who enjoyed the interaction displays that made the experience more fun."
"1","For the price I was incredibly disappointed. My steak (medium rare) was totally over cooked. Our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done. Our waitress didn't offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for. \n\nThe only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine."
"2","I love Chicago hot dogs. I have loved them since I was a wee girl. Therefore, any place that makes a real deal, Vienna beef, loaded Chicago dog is aces in my book. \n\nIs Matt's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? No. Is Matt's the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future."
"2","I've been here quite few times and while F&H isn't perfect it's better than so e of the reviews here make it sound. First the bad, like other reviews have mentioned, sometimes the service can be bit slow. It's usually fine but it admittedly has a few more bad days than some other places. On the other hand they have pretty solid lunch specials, great wings (the Hot BBQ are delicious), and some nice beer specials ($2.50 drafts on Thursday ($2 domestics), Yes Please!) They also have plenty of TVs and a pretty good customer rewards program and when it comes to a sports bar, what more do you really need."
"1","We just received the worst service ever I will never come back. Its shocking that on wing special night it was merly 6 tables. One person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks. We had To ask for everything numerous of times. Service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly. I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks. We told the management We needed to pay another check and that We didn't know why the waitress would leave one out, his response was unprofessional.  :("
"2","I went for a Saturday afternoon World Cup game for third place between Germany and Uruguay.  Most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasn't too noisy.  Service was really slow but the waitress was authentic.  Not the best review since I ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good & fresh.  I tried the sweet potato fries too.  The fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance."
"1","Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. \n\nWhat I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. \n\nStick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner."
"2","Great food. I had the hooley kebab for dinner. It was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it. Huge portion. Tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it! It was trivia night so winning 50 bones certainly helped w that 5th star;)"
"2","Really nice outdoor patio. Sunday drink special on whiskey was really good. Very reasonable price for uptown. Nice variations on Irish cuisine.  Worth checking out!"
"2","WOW! Very good food!!!!! The wait staff was very friendly and quick!  I always love the sharing family style of chinese restaurants!  You must go here!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!  And the person who suggested the donuts!!! THANK YOU!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!!!"
"2","What a place. My wife and I came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky. \n\nWe showed up early as it was an early day all around for us. This place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back. Now for the long wait until next time."
"2","This is a great  stop for a meal if your going to a Bobcat's game or any event at Time Warner arena.\nThey have covered garage parking for just $5 and a menu that just won't quit. They've got something for everyone.\nTry the Mahi tacos, two fresh and flavorful,  crispy tacos, covered with a soft flour tortilla...the flavor screams at you...!\nIf it's busy, you can get a game of pool on the two billiard tables or sit at the bar and enjoy on of the many big screen plasmas. \nIt's a five mimute walk to the Bobcat's and the Blue Line Lynx with easy access stop to Panthers."
"2","While I am not much on chain restaurants, Rock Bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again.  \n\nMy boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover.  Rock Bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool.  The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).\n\nThe menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.  \n\nThe gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.  These girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing - which is the key to a great bartender.  We were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to Rock Bottom and had friends meet us there.  \n\nGood food, great service, great drinks...we will definitely be back."
"1","Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls, we had a reservation, waited 10 minutes to be seated, was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together.  We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken, but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.  \n\nIn the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time."
"1","After two recent visits here, I can honestly say I am torn on my review, but overall I know I have had better. Most recently, we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors, because the patio was full, and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa???\nOn to the food.  We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive, the fries, great seasoning!\nAs for the service, I wish I took her name, but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell. No refills, never saw her, except our order and bill, and very blah! \nNot sure we would return anytime soon."
"1","The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment.\nI have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).\nWe sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.\nI had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables."
"1","First time here , only thing nice about this place is the location. The food from the frozen baked wings , bland Mac and cheese , tasteless stuffed brisket burger , and let's not forget the pepperoni pizza that Sam's food club can do better . This has to be the worse bar food for game watching in Charlotte, NC ."
"2","I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space."
"2","Best place to go, uptown, for all of your eye care needs. Great docs and staff. \nHighly recommend."
"2","I'm really trying to branch out more into Uptown...ye though I walk through the valley of death...oops, I digress.\n\nThe Hubbs and I had a guest in town and he suggested we eat here.  I happened to take a chance on this place, without consulting Yelp, and I have to say I'm glad I *again* (see Golden Taipei) went out on blind faith!!!\n\nI got the Ravioli Pecca-something-Italian-sounding and it was tasty!  Had those cute, broccoli and sun-dried tomatoes...mmm mmm!  My husband got some sort of roast beef sammie and the meat was cooked au jus. Needless to say, he was full and happy and our guest joyfully guzzled down some chicken wings (because apparently, where he lives in West bumble-**** Virginia no one makes chicken wings?! But, that's another blasphemy for another day).\n\nWhat makes me a fan is the fully-loaded bar and drink selection.  Our waitress made a wonderful recommendation based off of how I was feeling (Libra Love: Crown Royal, Malibu Rum, Pineapple juice, and raspberry something-or-other...can you tell it worked?) and I appreciated how she kept the rounds coming (our guest enjoyed Jack & Coke).  The atmosphere was pretty chill and they can cater to larger parties, so I'm already thinking about some type of girls night outing including Presto!\n\nThis would also be a great date night spot (reserved for pay day weekends)"
"2","I'm visiting Charlotte for work and found this place through restaurant.com.  I'm glad I did!\n\nI went with a friend from the area who was a little weary about its location but was pleasantly surprised by the inside.  It's cute and quaint with a touch of modern flair.  We each started with a martini as they are all $4 dollars on Thursdays (normally $7-9).  The waters didn't actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards, but the martinis were welcomed with open arms - and were yummy!  The food came out quickly and hot... I ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp.  It was nicely flavored, it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough.  I was disappointed that I didn't have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers!  My friend ordered the grits.  Definitely a good dish but I would not recommend it to those who don't like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick.\n\nAll in all a good experience.  Check it out!"
"1","Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else)."
"1","Summary:  Beautiful hotel, highly error-prone staff. \n\nIt is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this. The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \""parlor\"" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \""weather report\"" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!"
"2","Like most other Westins, the decor is very nice, and rooms are spacious and full of amenities. The bar and the restaurant is pretty good. Location is in  downtown, but certainly on the edge of town.\n\nDeducting one star since they don't have a platinum/concierge lounge."
"2","I had a tremendously positive experience at this Westin (the 12th-ish or so I've stayed at this year).  \n\n- Beautiful, very new-seeming property\n- Great location pretty close to anything you'll need\n- Reasonable prices on self-parking\n- Excellent service\n- Extremely clean, well-kept and comfy space (I was on the 22nd floor...so I suppose I can only speak for it)\n- Upgraded to a corner suite that was amazing---very well appointed, functional and comfortable\n\nAgain, this is my 12th or so Westin stay this year---and it has been the best of all of those."
"1","There are much better choices in uptown Charlotte!  Let me start with the good...the front desk staff. The three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. Great customer service!\n\nNow the bad...stains. There is no other way to describe everything in my room. Multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter. The bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that I kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant. Every, yes every, bath towel had a stain (either black or yellow). There was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past. Even the shower curtain was stained. Then there was the hair dryer. It was sooooo sticky that I didn't even want to touch it. It appeared to be covered in about 15 years worth of cheap hairspray. \n\nI can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon, but come on people!  How about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now!  \n\nLet me be clear that I think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given. They just need a better starting product!"
"1","I've stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality.  There was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day I waited 30 minutes to check in.  As a result, I didn't have time to go up to the room before leaving for dinner.  They said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when I got back at 10:30 p.m., ready to collapse, they were no where to be found.\n\nThere was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working.  Not the kind of experience I expect from a hotel where there are additional fees for everything - I'm talking $15 for one day of parking!  \n\nI have high standards for this place since my previous stays have been great.  Why are you slacking Westin Charlotte?"
"1","Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man. The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place. Doesn't even deserve one star in my book. \n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
"1","I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.\n\nI signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.\n\nHowever when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.\n\nAs I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company."
"1","Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay, then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds.  Not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account.  No, this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage.  Their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the Charlotte area."
"1","After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY. I hope all the CEOs get halitosis and their wives leave them for John Mayer."
"1","It is the first time I gave 1-rated review, while I normally gave 4-5 stars regardless of service quality. The worst service came from TWC. Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done. All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me \""I can't do this, I can't do that\"". Worst service ever!"
"1","Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed!\n\n I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!!\n\n For my first course i had the \""Baked Beans\"" as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....\n\nOnly good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!"
"2","Taking in a Surprise \n\nTaking a light outdoor walk from Camden Southend to the streets of uptown Charlotte sure makes one hungry. The first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off South Tryon. It was so bright it was reflecting off the mirror statue at the Betchlor Museum across the street. The next thing I know I am staring the menu at the best table in the house. (If you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is.) The light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations. The comfortable and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself. \n\nI had the mussels which were Euphoric. Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good when mixed together. My palate was very pleased and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds."
"2","I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""massage\"" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out."
"1","I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all."
"2","I've been to this place over 100 times over the years of working uptown and just checked in for the first time. The staff here is great and friendly, the service is quick and its not very pricey. I love the chips and salsa and Mexican pizza and come quiet often for the breakfast."
"2","Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd."
"1","A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch."
"2","I have been to the Actor's Theatre for several productions now, and I always forget to review them.  From Chaps to the Evil Dead to Rocky Horror, some are packed, some are, well, less than packed, but they never disappoint.\n\nIf you should happen by on opening night, they typically have an extra special event where you get some tasty goodies from the sponsor (seems like it is usually the same one, but it may change from show to show) as well.\n\nThey also have a cult movie night on (all? many? some?) Mondays with free admission and popcorn, so be sure and check that out if you are looking for something to do.\n\nLike most places, they have a nice little bar, and drink prices are not too bad, but it would be nice if they would give you the whole beer instead of pouring 2/3 of it or so into a cup.  I do not know if they keep the extra little bit for themselves or the next guy in line, but it is just one of those things that can be a little annoying, you know?"
"1","My instinct always told me that I should skip this place. Should have listened. It was just gross; literally and figuratively. I was afraid to see what I was stepping on out on the dance floor. Music was good, drinks were surprisingly decent. But oh, the other club patrons...\nI appreciate a little adult fun time dancing as much as the next gal, but it was just sleazy."
"2","Mert's has my favorite collard greens and corn bread in Charlotte.  The salmon cakes are delicious as are the pork chops.  Fried chicken is above average, although not as delicious as the previous two entrees mentioned."
"2","Cornbread!! So yummy.  We took our friend visiting here for some \""soul food\"" and Mert's did not disappoint.  Come with an appetite!"
"2","Wow. This place is excellent!\n\nI grew up in Charlotte and sadly, never discovered this place until after I moved away. I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out. \n\nThe meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.\n\nThen there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like... \n\nOur server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard. \n\nLove love loved it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!"
"2","Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.  \n\nWife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was great though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...\n\nI like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!"
"1","I really wanted to get grub at Price's, but they don't have a dining area and I didn't want to get take out.\n\nCame here for lunch.  Waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved.  Free cornbread was average.   I had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese.  Surprisingly, none of it was really that good.  Service was cheerful though.\n\nI guess the best part was I was able to park in downtown Charlotte, found a free spot, and wasn't towed when I was done eating here."
"2","Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying."
"2","Was in Charlotte for two days and Merts Heart & Soul was recommended by everyone. Good food great location and I was impressed by the price. I went for Dinner Saturday then brunch on Sunday. I recommend it to"
"2","Mert's is true southern soul food.  Not the New American type, but the real stuff.  Mac-n-cheese, green beans cooked in animal fat, salmon cakes, fried chicken.  It's all good.  I love the mac-n-cheese and will often just order a veggie plate where I can pick 4 different ones to eat.  They always have vegetable specials so I can try something new every time I go.  \n\nThey also had 4 different hot sauces on the table.  I made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make."
"1","The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \""It'll be right up.\"" He did not\nconsider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated."
"1","Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place! Once again, great food but super horrible service! Not sure, due to the service, that we will return the next time we are in Charlotte!"
"2","****** 4.5 stars *****\n\nOne of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \""great\"" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \""upscale Southern\"" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!"
"2","Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good."
"2","I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future."
"1","We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?"
"1","First and last to this club. Very pricy,poor service and no contact dance. ... Other clubs in charlotte are better ... Very disappointed ....."
"2","You've gotta get the fried fish sandwich! While down here for a conference, my coworker who was local convinced me I had to try the fish sandwich...and get one to take on the plane too. While the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty, they're not the most amazing thing I've ever had. The mac and cheese was a good call (more on the gooey side) and the fish, while messy, was simply astounding. All for approx $10 too. plus they're a local Charlotte family chain, which I absolutely adore. Service was prompt. The only thing is that they close at 3pm. \n\nIf I ever get to come back to Charlotte, I'll pick up some Showmars!"
"2","Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-)  I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy!  Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too!"
"2","Since I have promised myself that I'm not allowed to move away from Charlotte until I have eaten at every restaurant, I figured that Restaurant Week would be a perfect time to visit Luce, a small Uptown spot that has been on my list for years.  Upon arrival, our table wasn't quiet ready.  No problem there, because the suggestion to \""grab a drink at the bar\"" was a given.  Tucked away in the corner, the attentive bar-goddess quickly poured us wine and presented us with nibbles.  Super-crunchy potato chips (which appeared to be made in house), as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us.  \n\nThese. Olives.  \n\nI wanted to fall asleep in a bowl if these olives.  I don't know what kind of magic the cooks/aka/olive-wizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them (fresh garlic? fresh rosemary? tears of their first born?), but I'm talking LIFE CHANGING. Like little baby angels.  \n\nThe food was great, service attentive and friendly.\nI'll definitely be back....for the olives."
"1","Not impressed!!  If there were 0 stars that's the rating this place would get.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what you'd expect from a school lunchroom!   And why is this place called an \""Irish Pub\""?  One would expect typical Irish dishes but not here!  I honestly have no idea how this place stays in business.  Sorry, Hartigan's, I won't be going back!"
"1","What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them."
"2","I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty good pizza.  \n\nI have eaten trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie."
"2","This is our first time coming to Brixx and we really enjoyed it. We ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola and the Bronx Bomber. The  Pear and Gorgonzola was unique. The Bronz Bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients. Personally I would have like them to be a little more crispy. But, that's just a personal preference. \n\nWhat I really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables! Great customer service and great food"
"2","Good food at the right prise. The wait staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. Enjoy the night and eat outside!"
"2","I finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous Christmas gift!! Ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first!!\n\nWe sat in a big booth for just the 3 of us and I started with the Pineapple Stoli Doli and it is dangerous! I could have had like 10...I didn't but i could have! We started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio both were good. \n\nFor my entree I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked. We had gotten 3 sides starting with the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was very good, but like my friend said there was nothing that made it OMG!! We also had the Onion Rings, and Sauteed Spinach which were also good.\n\nWe had the Creme Brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than I thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner.\n\nOur server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it!"
"2","My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end! \n\nCapital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \""It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\"" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! \n\nBut I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.\n\nCapital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!"
"1","To quote ESPN... \""c'mon man!\""  How about putting a decent product on the floor.  And where is Michael Jordan?  Does he attend games?  The night we went they were playing the Celtics.  BTW, we are BIG Celtics fans.  It reminded me of seeing a Red Sox game in Camden Yards.  In other words, felt like a home game for Boston.\n\nAs in most sporting arenas, the concessions are RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED.  Two sodas that you would pay $2 - $3 for at a fast food place cost $12.\n\nI also ordered a Jerk Chicken Sandwich.  Did it come straight from the refrigerator?  Cold cold cold.\n\nBack to the concessions, why do we... the Joe Q. Publics of the world put up with that?  Next time, I'm eating before and will visit the local water fountain for a drink!\n\nAt the end of the game, I went to meet a fellow \""Yelper\"" and we were chatting for no more than 2-3 minutes when an usher came along and said we needed to vacate.  Thanks for coming... now get the *&^%$( out!  Haha.  He was very pleasant about it.\n\nWell, no more Celtics visits until next season.  See you then."
"1","Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)  \n\nLol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.\n\ndmo out."
"1","Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disgusting. I honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life. From the frozen crab cakes to the unseasoned grouper.. my experience left me confused and hungry. This is simply a Marriott hotel restaurant - not an award winning restaurant by any means."
"2","Went to the Belk Bowl here. I couldn't believe how nice the stadium is inside. When Atlanta builds a new stadium, they need to take note. I was impressed by the food selection & quality. The bathrooms stayed clean & the attendants were all very nice & smiling. Kudos to the designers & managers of this facility. We had a nice visit to Charlotte & a W in the BoA Stadium."
"1","Only two stars due to the lack of selection.  No food menu and inside is like a dungeon.  They do have a nice outside area with TVs and a rather secluded environment.  One of these stars is because of their Sunday special.  $4 Car Bomb shots!!  Other than that, they really don't have any other specials.  I asked the bartender why that was?? His response, \""we don't want to attract that kind of crowd.\""  What crowd would that be, sir?? hmmmmm.. Pass on this place.  \n\n-Ian M."
"2","When I'm out and people ask for advice about where they should go next, I send them here.\n\nI love this place. It could be packed or completely empty... doesn't matter. I always have a good time. Sober or drunk. Yes, I have in fact been here sober. Go ahead, bring the jokes.\n\nConnolly's is like a family. Many of the bartenders have worked here for years. They are all super friendly and damn good at slinging drinks. These are the same masterminds involved in Tyber Creek, Dandelion and Prohibition. They know what they're doing.\n\nThe patio is huge. Perfect for after work cocktails or Sunday funday. Cornhole, tables, TVs. Pick your poison. Speaking of poison, if you're in the mood for a car bomb... go here to get it. And be sure to buy me one. \n\nFridays and Saturdays you can typically expect a cover. It's usually just $5. You'll find that at several bars in uptown.\n\nI'm happy this uptown staple is not only still kicking it, but also remains one of the most popular watering holes in Center City. I know I don't have to say this, but don't ever change Connolly's."
"2","Fastest year of my life! The growth panel is complete and we couldn't be happier. The last session was the most fun. Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I didn't think we'd get huge laughs and smiles. I was wrong. Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots. They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward. \n\nWhen I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place. Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play... she didn't cry (remember she's been having separation anxiety). She actually had a fun time. They were really nice and patient with us."
"1","There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of Thai peanut sauce. Tasty indeed however, what a large mess this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich.\nWith this said, the staff was very nice. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches...."
"1","This brueggs kinda sucks. Every time I've come they are out of multiple kinds of bagels so someone isn't doing their counts correctly (use to work at a brueggers). The service is lousy. Also apparently brueggers discontinued sprouts-not this stores fault but wtf?! Sprouts are awesome. Going to Poppy's next time."
"1","Not again\nA few simple items turned into a large bill. I thought the charges were excessive and questionable services  that they stated I needed. I unfortunatey did not have time for my routine mechanic, thought this would be convienent with work location. shopper beware\nNot again for me."
"1","Staff was very friendly. But food and drinks were disappointing. This place markets itself as \""Martini specialists\"" but I had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives. Also - olives were standard jarred fair. A much better martini can be had at \""Urban Sip\"" above the Ritz - they have Spanish giant olives hand-stuffed with blue cheese."
"1","In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again."
"1","We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown."
"1","Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again."
"1","When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them."
"1","The toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all I needed to know about the Omni.  I won't even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling.  \nI can scarcely believe this is an Omni after staying at Pittsburg's Omni.  The lobby is beautiful, but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel.  There are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration, but I wonder if it's all because the Ritz is being built across the street..."
"1","GROSS! \nI can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...\n\nwe took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God! \nThe front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable.\nI am going to post the pics"
"1","AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""signature\"" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had \""re-heated\"" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he \""saw\"" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as \""Aquavina\"".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!"
"2","I have had the baked Chicken (Thursday special) and it is WONDERFUL!. A great change from all the chain and fast food restaurants downtown. It does get very crowded and little awkward when it is that way. \nThe food comes fast and is delicious. I have only been here for weekday lunches, usually Thursday. My coworkers love the other specials too. \nIf you are looking for a change from the everyday, this place is a great one to start!"
"1","Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order."
"1","I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived, it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown, do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon, Mimosa Grille, Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch."
"2","I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\n\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."
"1","ZERO stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home, but when the floors were ripped up, the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks.  My home warranty company gave me the number to Carolina Appliance Service.  I left a message and got a call back right away.  When I told the guy my situation, he stopped me and said he was NOT interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him.  He actually started an argument with me.  I assume he was the owner because he said \""my company\"".  But my simple question was 'Isn't that what you do?  Fix dishwashers?'...why is this company even on my home warranty's list of providers.  He argues so much that I didn't even get to tell him this wasn't part of an insurance claim.  So to recap...very rude, with obviously NO CONFIDENCE in his own work.  Don't call these guys."
"1","Carowinds in my opinion is crap. Poor customer service in all parts of the park. Managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it. Six flags a few hours away is so much better. Carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money. The food is very pricey and its not that great."
"1","In my opinion, Duke is destroying the environment in North Carolina as well as other states it operates in. The Dan River will never be the same and due to owning several politicians, they only cleaned up a fraction of the coal ash they spilled into the River."
"2","I wholeheartedly agree with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere. \n\nWhy I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up."
"1","Wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks. Just cancelled and move to Fitness Connection for $10 bucks a month. For that price I can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the Y. This place is seriously over sold. Stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members. Serious over crowding issue."
"2","This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week, which while I would prefer 11, works for me. Also, going at non-peak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face- ain't no crowds at 9:30 pm! I generally stay in the Women's Fitness Center, which is a gym inside itself, but every now and then I'll make it upstairs. The desk staff is always friendly, and there are plenty of amenities to utilize. The one area I haven't ventured into yet are the group exercise, mainly for scheduling reasons, but I am eager to sneak into one one day."
"2","Wonderful restaurant and very friendly wait staff.  I made reservations and was seated promptly.  The grilled salmon was made to perfection and the flirtini's were great.  I actually met a quality guy there as well.  ;)  Overall, the experience was awesome.  Very nice restaurant, good food, friendly staff, valet was a bit slow, but overall a good time and worth the money."
"2","This was a surprisingly great find - the menu had plent of options, the service was outstanding with wonderful recommendations (definitely trust the waitress), and from appetizer to dessert, just a wonderful experience."
"2","I have been here twice and it was excellent both times.  Great atmosphere.  Attentive service, but not overly so.  Good wine and drink list.  I had the scallops as an entr\u00e9e both times.  Delicious!  Tried a variety of the appetizers.  All excellent!  Definitely a top choice in Charlotte."
"2","We had to rush in and rush out. So we got what we wanted. Great service, great menu, and accommodating. Having only been here once so far, we'll go again."
"2","Best sushi I've had so far in Charlotte! Make sure you try their Coastal Roll; my husband and I were floored by the sushi quality and the price!\n\nWonderful restaurant and evening all around!"
"1","HORRIBLE college. Good luck going there or getting help when you needi it. The only person I found to be helpful was Brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job. I will def be contacting higher management due to the lack of communication I have recieved. I do NOT reccommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education. I have never seen such a horrible COMMUNITY COLLEGE in my life time."
"1","Although the price is right and the fried rice is pretty good, it's severely overshadowed by the \""off\"" taste of the beef and chicken dishes.  The beef with scallion is 90% bamboo shoots, which isn't even listed as an ingredient, and the dumplings are incredible hulking globs."
"1","I can't say my expectations were too high, but I definitely expected better.  My cashew chicken was inedible, and I was only able to eat the fried rice and egg roll (which were fine).  The chicken was so chewy that I could not bring myself to take a second bite.\n\nWill not go back."
"2","Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run."
"2","I've eaten there twice now, and really enjoyed it both times. This IS exceptional because I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine! We ordered our food \""family style\"" both times. Lots of food and lots of fun that way. \n\nWe had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Carciofi, and the Cheese Ravioli. All were outstanding, especially having been preceded with the Tuscan Salad and \""Mama's Salad\"". Fanatastico!\n\nGreat food and great service. I'll go back again if I'm in downtown Charlotte in the future."
"1","Horrible customer service. Unless you are into horror movies or The Simpsons the people working the counter can't give you a honest review. However they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap. Can't wait to go back!!"
"1","I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner, and affiliated with Presbyterian as well, and so any time they want to order up something that they can't handle in the office, guess where they send us?\n\nTo make matters worse, the place is always full (or overfull), always understaffed, and always incapable of handling anything.  The emergency department is horrid, but to make matters worse, it's better than being admitted.\n\nIn one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever, what should have been a simple examination - passed from our regular doctor - ended up being at least 12 hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room, then several days (yes days) in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day.  That's right - one test per day!\n\nThe test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.  It was simply pathetic.\n\nWhatever you do, do not go to the emergency room at Presbyterian."
"1","Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte, I'd heard that Maharani was a cheaper but tasty option, so we ordered from there a few nights ago. \n\nCopper is definitely still my place, but Maharani was fine enough. First of all, the food came very quickly, which is rare. Usually indian food, good indian good, takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30, which was great 'cause we were starving. \n\nThe Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good, but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight."
"2","ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter \""andrew\"", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very good and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service."
"1","This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed, but absolutely terrible.  Not that we ate the food, because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks, our appetizer came out with no silverware, no plates, still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter, he brought the drinks, still no plates and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no plates and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill, are looking for terrible service, aren't in a rush, and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise, stay away!"
"1","I ordered take out of Tom Yum soup and Chilli Chicken, what a disappointment. None of these tasted good, Tom Yum soup was kinda disgusting."
"1","I have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors. However I was VERY DISAPPOINTED for their lack of \""respect\"" to what a customer orders.  I order my usual the MEE GORENG with TOFU and as I combed through and had a couple of bites I found a strip of chicken.  I lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish.  This place is black listed for me and I hope to find a better Malaysian place in the Queen City."
"1","This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.  \n\nThe one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth."
"1","Meh. I've experienced better. The staff is friendly. Just basic chinese food."
"1","This place is ok. The people who work there are amazing though. They love what they do and they enjoy helping you. They have a great comic book selection however, I wish they carried more toys. \n\nSadly, this placed is owned by a guy who only cares about profit and not customer service. Kind of a jerk."
"1","Best place in Charlotte for comics, hands down. Sadly, not the best place to go for a friendly staff. Condescending tones and mockery of things I asked for/was inquiring about are not a good way to get return business! :( I'll buy online before I go in here again."
"2","Great tailoring hands down. I've had jeans taken in, dresses altered and hems taken up - all perfectly done. I will say, though, that you get what you pay for, i.e. it's not affordable tailoring.  A pair of jeans cost $20 to be taken in, and $20 for hemmed pants or dress. While I personally think it's worth it for expert tailoring, others may think it's a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring. \n\nAlso, the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked. You can trust your nicest pieces here - they are in good hands!"
"2","I did not use his service because he told me that the corrections that I needed in my clothes would not look good after.  He could have just done it and take the money, but he preferred to advise me and not do the work. Definitely will be back when I need something to be done."
"1","I really, really want to like Showmars because it's local, but it's just kind of icky in the environment. It was probably a unique spot before they spread all over the area, but now that Charlotte is super-saturated, it's just not that interesting. \n\nThe french fries are ok, I guess. The veggie pita is no good...clearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it. Maybe I was disappointed because I had high expectations, and maybe it's an alright place for the meat-eaters...but it's just not good for me. I haven't had a good experience, and I've been to a few locations. I won't be going back."
"2","Good food. Friendly staff. Good prices.  I love the Chicken and Broc.  Generals Chicken is good but not great. This is a staple in my diet since I live so close!!"
"1","My cookie had no fortune."
"2","HOHO CHERRY HOUSE, not to be confused with a brothel, offers average food at cheap prices. Fast delivery and friendly staff. No matter what protein you pick it pretty much tastes the same."
"2","Monday night drink specials and an amazingly musical performance will be provided to you with a 5 dollar cover.. What more could you ask for?\n\n\nThis building breeds history and I was proud to experience it my last night in Charlotte."
"2","I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this place.  Seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard.  Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time.  There is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time.  Looking at the other reviews, I think the food is kind of hit or miss.  I guess I was lucky with the red beans and rice, it was really good by my standards at least."
"2","LOVE the Etouffee! The chicken with rice and beans is amazing. I can't wait to go back. I love the casual feel and the food is just down right good."
"2","The service is great, the food is great.  There's not really anything I can add that hasn't been said in the other reviews.\n\nOther than:  If you don't order the beignets for brunch, you are seriously insens\u00e9.  (that's 'insane' in french.  i think.)"
"1","So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. \n\nThe atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. \n\nAll in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord."
"1","I'm not an avid go-karter but I've been enough times to know what to expect.  This go-kart establishment is by far the worst that I've been to. I've been to go karting in places in LA, Boston, and Vegas and what all of those places had that this lacked was a safety/training person/video to tell you what the safety rules are.  This place, all you do is sign up via computer, pay your way and you (not guided) look for the entrance to put your track suit on. No one in the room to tell you what to put on. No one in the room to tell you where to go. So you find your way to the track and wait in the line to drive. Again, no training video, no guide to tell you what is what, what the rules are, etc. You just get in your car and drive. I wouldn't mind the lax safety/security procedures so much if my brother and I didn't get YELLED at by the manager/owner on the track. His exact words were, \""WHERE ON PLANET EARTH CAN YOU STILL DRIVE WITH YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING?\""  If I'm expected to stop at yellow lights on your track, you've got to tell me before we start racing. (Backstory: the yellow lights were on because someone crashed; okay so why do I need to use caution in other parts of the track where the crash isn't...we slowed as we got closer to the crash site ... that's when we got yelled at! We were like, whoa, where the heck did that come from. That's what ruined the racing experience.)   This place doesn't hold a candle to K1 or F1."
"1","I must say I am very disappointed with the way it's establishment is ran, we had a group of kids (7) some with experience and some not, then they put 3 adults In the adult kart and ran all over the kids and ran almost 36 sec faster, not a safe experience for the younger kids."
"2","Replacing an unsuccessful print and framing shop on the corner of 35th and North Davidson, tattoo artist and native Charlottean Joey Vernon has put together a shop full of phenomenal artist  with Fu's Custom Tattoo's that has become one of the busiest businesses in the NoDa neighborhood in the last year.\n\nThe non-inked can cringe and marvel at the artistry with the window booth on gallery crawls while fans of skin art can get tattooed in the open and social set up throughout the rest of the shop.  Or they can swing in and scope out the adjacent Baku art gallery that houses some of the ink houses' artists' canvas works beyond the skin.\n\nIn my thirteen some odd years of being tattooed, and having sat for five different artist, this is one of the most laid back and social tattoo parlors that I have graced.  It makes for a very comfortable setting during what can prove to be a somewhat uncomfortable experience.\n\nOld school traditional, japanese, black work, et cetera.  They have a stable of more than competent artist that can either translate the artwork you bring with you or create a one of a kind piece to last a lifetime.\n\nI have sat with Matt Terry who is insanely good and look forward to having Joey work on me in the not too distant future..."
"2","I wasn't supposed to be in Charlotte, but canceled flights, etc.  You know how that goes, so I spent several hours here.\n\nThings I like about this airport:\n\nInteresting food options, and what I had was good.  I never expected to be eating tasty BBQ Brisket, Beans, Cornbread & Fried Pickles at an airport restaurant.  \n\nRockers.  All over the place there are rocking chairs.\n\nClean, open feel to the architecture.\n\nSmoothly operating airport.\n\nWireless.\n\nBasically, if you have to be stuck at an airport, I'd take this one over many others!"
"2","Since I travel almost exclusively with US Airways, CLT (their main hub) is a frequent stop and I've been flying in/out of there for roughly 4 years now.\n\nPlanes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport I'm flying out of.  I've gone both domestic and international without a hassle.  If you have status with US Airways the fast track on the security line is a god send.\n\nThe restaurants are good with some lively bars.  The airport itself has a very open feel to it, littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell.  Shopping's decent if you're into that sort of thing.  It could do with more electrical outlets for the business travelers, but otherwise it's a solid place."
"1","One of my least favorite airports.  The flights I end up taking into Charlotte (e.g., STL to PHF) invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection.  You'd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates, but there is NOTHING more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway, or someone slowly trudging along on the left.\n\nFor god's sake, people: Just like on the road, pass on the left, walk on the right.  There are people in this airport, obviously not you, that are in a HURRY.\n\nCan't speak much to the food and drink options here.  The selections seem plentiful.  US Airways was friendly to me here, too, when a flight was canceled back home.  They shuttled me to a nearby hotel -- I forget where -- and covered both my transportation and lodging for the night.  Good work, guys."
"1","Honestly wish I could give it zero stars based on today... ? Security is beyond the worst. Check in with the airline was smooth, thats about it.\nI'm sure its not this bad everyday, or it would be on the news and or shutdown from the lack of business...."
"2","Jamba Juice and free WiFi."
"2","Nice airport with good dining choices. The US Airways Lounge is great too."
"1","The two stars are bonus points, but it gets the basics wrong.\n\npro: \n- Bright, airy\n- I never need to walk miles to get to the terminal \n- Very cool statues greet people to the Queen City, those always put a smile on my face. \n\ncons: \n- No restaurants or bars available to hang out with family and friends and wait for the (often delayed) departing flight. That's a deal breaker for me. Security checks are here to stay, do something about it. \n\n- TSA agents are often rude and overly aggressive. Yes, compared to other big cities. \n\n- Employing bathroom attendants, News Break: hello, the fifties are over! \n\n- Not enough airlines service Charlotte or compete for its business. \n\n- Not enough direct flights in or out. Unless I want to make the trip 4 hours longer that need be, the only direct flights to London are with USfreakingAirways. For a wannabe INTERNATIONAL HUB that's not too famous."
"2","I like CLT.  This airport is large and has a lot of people going through it, and there are many places to stop in, grab lunch or dinner, and get to your next stop.  I normally don't have much time to hang out here, but I have been to a couple restaurants and they were clean and fast.\n\nI especially like the fact this airport has six Starbucks locations.  If you are flying FROM Charlotte, try the A concourse TSA line, it is usually shorter."
"2","Thoroughly impressed with this airport. \n\nNot that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.  \n\nBeing a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it. \n\nWhen we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (\""US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT\"").  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.  \n\nI might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think..."
"2","Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  The rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can.\n\nThe only complaint I have are with the transport carts.  They are constantly beeping no matter what direction they're going.  I can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it's really annoying when it's constant.  Especially when you have 40 minutes to kill at the gate.\n\nThank goodness for the free WiFi..."
"2","Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though.."
"1","i hate US Airways, shitty services"
"2","This review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room. It is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions. The chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a Quran,bible, and Torah available. There are also prayer mats for Muslims, and an altar to kneel at. I believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff. \nBeing Muslim I really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so. I used the room twice upon arrival an departure when praying the second time around I was joined by a catholic gentleman so the room does get use. Thank you CD airport for a blessing to passengers needing a place to pray and worship."
"1","Really need shorter waiting lines- it got worse. \nThe valet is annoying and gets in the way."
"2","Great little airport. Now direct connection to Europe. Live piano music in terminal. Us airways hub. Rental car shuttles run every few minutes. Lots of charging stations for electronic devices. Airport is also small enough to make transfers easy."
"2","It's a nice airport to have a layover in. Free wifi is only for 45 minutes but there are tons of eateries, shopping and even a spa. \nThe only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane.  It's a HUGE airport.\nOn my layover on my way out I did get to enjoy a great lox sandwich at Einstein Bros Bagels.  \nOn my way back I had 15 minutes to get to my plane.  I suppose I should have asked one of the carts for help."
"1","Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. \n\nIt's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not very fun. \n\nThe bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very \""behind in the time\"". \n\nThere was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport."
"2","So honest moment I was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a great venue. \n\nWhile we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there. By far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to Charlotte and landed on the Hudson. After seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle. \n\nAnother really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch. If you're into history, aviation or just want to know more about this memorable flight...you'll want to visit here!"
"1","We ordered breakfast here during a layover. My croissant was literally dripping cloudy looking water.  Since we plopped down almost 20 bucks, I tried forcing it down until I felt something odd in my mouth.,,  a hair that neither matched my hair's color or ethnicity.  This BK should be shut down!!!!"
"1","Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice?"
"1","Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.  \n\nThis K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't decide then if visiting K-Mart is frugal or frivolous, but who doesn't need another cheap belt?"
"1","I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too."
"2","Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty."
"1","It's old. Everything was pretty clean, except there was a chocolate smear on the sheet... sketchy. Really, it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate. Breakfast had been cleaned out before 8:30, so get up super early if you want more than white bread and OJ. We might come back if it's still cheap."
"1","If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.  \n\nGot the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.  \n\nSummary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again."
"1","Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty bad here.  \n\nMy order has been consistently wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff aren't making sure they are making food to order.  \n\nAdditionally (and this may seem like a strange note) the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendy's.  It doesn't use the space well, and it's not clear where to stand. \n\nMy office very close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendy's at 2801 Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service."
"1","Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \""Minced\"" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   \n\nFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \""okay\"" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  \n\nAs for the barbecue, it is also \""okay;\"" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise."
"1","Ditto the other ratings for UVerse customer service, at least once you get past the fabulous sales people. My install was scheduled for between 9-11 am on a Saturday, dude called at 2:30 to say he was the \""outside guy\"" and was on his way. Was indignant when I asked about the earlier time frame (actually I laughed when I answered the phone and found out who he was....3.5 hrs late!), but I let him come and do at least the outside work. Called the number on my scheduled appt email at 3:30, got a woman who knew nothing about my issues, tried to transfer me to dispatch, transfer failed. She called me back, I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 15 minutes. She called back again, tried to transfer me to somebody else, said there was a \""problem\"" with my order, but she couldn't tell me what it was. After another 20 minutes on hold, I hung up. She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable! Not thrilled with Time Warner or most of their contracted install/repair folks, but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule, they call! DON'T DO IT!"
"1","I made an appointment because I had an terrible, stabbing ear ache. After waiting nearly an hour after my appointment time, I was quickly ushered into a tiny room and without being asked anything, I was given a hearing test. I never asked for it and don't know why it was done. Then after another long waiting period, the doctor finally saw me and he tells me I have hearing loss. He looks into my aching ear and bluntly tells me I have no infection but rather TMJ which really, really scared me. I think he was wrong because two days later I had infected bumps on the side of my face and after it cleared, no more pain. The entire visit was a horrible waste of time which didn't help me at all and took nearly three hours!"
"1","Be prepared to wait. We were told to be here at 11:15 for an 11:40 appointment. Coming up on an hour wait, ugh!\nAfter waiting over an hour to see the doctor, and to only talk to him for 5 minutes, was very disappointing.  The appointment was for my Mother who was previously told she could undergo a specific eye surgery and then upon arriving and pre-op review, she was not qualified. Not only was the experience in this office disappointing, it was a disappointing day for my Mother after expectations were expected."
"2","Decent McDonalds. Definitely better than the one in Houston that I used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent. I like this one and its a keeper! \n\nPlace - two stories and for the most part, clean.\n\nPrice - it's Mickey D's. \n\nService - somewhat quick in the drive-thru, friendly people. They only forgot once, but it's forgivable."
"1","RUDE RUDE RUDE. I normally NEVER leave a review of a fast food chain, but this is an exception.  The workers are just plain rude.  The fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale.  Avoid this place unless you just don't give a crap about how your treated and want a sub par Big Mac."
"1","I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.\n\nBut with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /"
"1","Went to Harper's this past Tuesday, it had been at least 6 months or more since I had  had the Betty's Pimento cheeseburger. Sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables, that was so cool! Seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but I did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries. I told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could actually fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.\n\nSo in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I guess I will have to find a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!"
"2","Harpers is good, when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night, with baked potato or sweet potato fries. \n\nI came by here on a Thursday night, and they hosted a trivia night! It was fun!! Sadly, with my new work schedule, I have not had an opportunity to come back on any Thursdays."
"1","Red alert. Red Alert. \n\nIf you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it went down....\n\nI headed in around 6:30pm as my contract expired so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I thought to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the \""receptionist\"" who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets. \n\nForty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer. \n\nNeedless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today."
"2","Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful, especially the Carolina Turkey Club."
"2","What a fun place to get ideas for your house! They have over 100 booths from different vendors selling everything from jewelry to furniture. We spent a few hours here and bought a few unique treats!"
"1","Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service."
"2","After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive \""comfort food\""."
"1","I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\n\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you."
"1","Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back."
"1","Don't move here this place is horrible! The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty... There is something always wrong with the apartment. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!"
"1","The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere."
"1","While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a \""business lunch\"" with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice."
"1","Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. \n\nThis last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. \n\nBlah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better."
"2","An associate of mine brought me lunch. TOGO and it was delicious. We tried the Spicy Chicken that was very flavorful and not burning your lips off. I tried their lo mein, which was delicious with varitey of meats. Finally I had the beef and broccoli with had a ginger/ orange sauce. Very tasty the beef was well cooked and medium, not tough. JUST ALL AROUND DELICIOUS."
"2","This is my new favorite HT. It's almost always crowded, but it's worth it!\n\nThe selection is better than most HTs, and the prices are even better. How the price can be different one HT 3 miles away from another HT is beyond me, but I've definitely noticed. \n\nOther differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others, and everything looks bright and clean. Who doesn't love shiny??\n\nThe HT in Matthews has a better local produce selection, but higher prices on everything else.  You can't win them all, I suppose."
"1","Eh, went here on Christmas for dinner. Had to first seating at 5. Order the special the prime rib, 5 minutes later oh we just sold out of that! great ordered the filet and it was just ok. Wine was outrageously overpriced. Amazing this place gets such great reviews. Oh and im OG palm one goer. The lobbies would have been a better call."
"2","Yes it is a chain but some chains are good!  The only reason I didn't give the Palm five stars is because YOU NEED A 6 OZ STEAK.  Us chicks can't handle 9 ounces!!!  \n\nI love the fillet - I get it with the Oscar option and I can't talk or think about anything else while I am eating it.  Perfectly cooked (I like medium-rare), perfectly seasoned (slightly salty!!), perfectly served in a little bit of au jus.  I had happy dreams for days....sigh....  \n\nThe app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.  I love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper.  Such a perfect way to shovel the Palm butter into my pie-hole.  \n\nService is excellent - fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the Palm.  Love it!\n\nThis location valet's which I recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop!  Can't wait for the next special occasion!!!!\n  :-D"
"1","I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time. PLEASE, if you are offering \""discount\"" for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot! Give me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres. Well guess what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks. It wasn't worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead I'll just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere."
"1","I went to OPH for dinner and decided on the eggs, bacon and pancakes. The pancakes and bacon were pretty good. The eggs I ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me. Two things stood out to me about the service. I was drinking coffee and the waitress asked if I wanted my coffee topped off with 'decaf' - I wasn't drinking decaf. Also, when I asked for more pancake syrup she brought me the almost empty (used) syrup from the neighboring table.... yuck!"
"1","We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I sent it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.\n\nOh, I should add that we went to the one by the Target near uptown."
"1","I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because \""the computer won't let us,\"" we again got a sub-par breakfast.  So if you want to wakey, wakey, eggs & bac-y, avoid this place.  You will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food."
"2","The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.\n\nThe food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.\n\nGo, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets."
"2","My family and I have gone to this location several times and the wait has never been too long and the food has always been doggy bag worthy..."
"2","everything was sold out when i needed to be in Charlotte and so I tried this location mainly because it was available for my dates. I was worried that it wouldn't be nice, but i was pleasantly surprised! \n\nThe room was clean, well decorated and had a bedroom and separate living room with its own tv, it also had a small well equipped  kitchen (I didnt use it) but it had pots, pans, 2 burners, a full size refrigerator and sinks etc. \n\nThey didn't have a yucky comforter, but a nice duvet too and plenty of pillows, which I insist on! :)\n\nThey had a good desk with free internet and the comminity areas were nice, inside they had breakfast (which i was always too late for - ends at 9am) but looked nice and they also have a bar that stays open late in that same spot - outside is a common area with a fire pit and lots of seating.\n\nThey have a little store with most essentials in the lobby 24 hours too. I had a terrible Dr. Pepper craving at like midnight and was able to get one downstairs.. thank goodness! I also grabbed coffee in the morning only to have my boss tell me we were going to Starbucks and I accidentally said RIGHT in front of the desk clerk - \n\n\""Oh! then i won't drink this crappy coffee... \"" \n\nI felt so bad as soon as I said it.. i am sure it is not crappy! \n\nI would stay here again, it was comfortable and affordable. The parking is kinda weird, but over all I was very impressed."
"2","Awesome church full of the spirit of God!"
"2","Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable. What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths? \n\nMy favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)"
"1","Glad we tried this at restaurant week prices.  Didn't realize it was  a \""corporate\"" place until we got our leftovers in  a bag advertising the network of places it was part of.  We had just said the food was decent but soulless, like you'd expect of a corporate restaurant when that bag arrived to our \""oh, that explains it.\""\nTypical South side snob crap.  High prices and low quality and originality  for people who want to be seen and spend alot and have the palettes of a 6 year old.  For more of the same you can buy $25 olive oil that's really canola at  Dean and Deluca next door.  \nLike the reviewer here  with one unsalted and one over salted selection, I will add that the duck was under cooked and the salmon over cooked.\nDISAPPOINTING"
"2","Phew, where to start with this place!!!!!!????  \nThis review is from a 1 time dinner experience on a Saturday. \n\nThe ambience is excellent.  Comfortable seating, spacious, and beautifully decorated.  Fun crowd that is business casual. \n\nOur service was excellent.  Really personable, made some solid recommendations and just really pleasant.  \n\nThe food was INCREDIBLE.  Let me spare your time and tell you that if you a very fresh tasting seafood dish whether it be sushi or oysters...go here.  Presentation is great, portion size is nice, flavors outstanding.  \n\nOverall, one of my best meals ever."
"1","More like Downstream. In town from CA and wanted to try something new. Bad decision. Bad service. Food was bland & ill prepared. What a disappointment."
"1","I really wanted to love Upstream, but it totally fell flat. We sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie, and it was one disappointment after the next. The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...\n\nWe ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were \""slightly undercooked\"" and he was \""trained that most food was sushi grade.\"" Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good. \n\nLastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.\n\nI can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.\n\nPrices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts."
"2","Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""home\"" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nI will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.  None of this bothers me, it is just entertaining.\n\nI have not met anyone very friendly there and I assume that is because it is the \""SoPark\"" area - but since I don't go to the gym to socialize I guess it doesn't matter."
"2","Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea, five stars!!! The Eggplant Dish was very good! The Belly Dancing gets Five stars!!!  Service also gets five stars!\n\nFrom there everything else was Good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as I hoped, still good!\n\nI'm the Only Dude here!  Eleven Female patrons including my Bride... add two Belly Dancers and our Waitress, I'm out numbered 14 to  1 !!!!!!  Great show!  If you have never seen live Belly Dancing it is Usually Entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun!\n\nPersian Ice Cream nice flavor combination of Pistachio, Rose Water and Saffron less dense than Kulfi - If I had never eaten (Indian Kulfi) I would have probably rated this Ice Cream Higher!\n\nBaklava a bit disappointing, papery filo, though drier than the overly syrupy version"
"1","A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff."
"2","\""The little hippie food market that could\"" seems so out of place in the \""corridor of crap\"" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there."
"1","We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better."

"1","Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!"

We actually haven't been in awhile, and funny how I brought up this place again today. I'm sure we'll be going back real soon!"
"2","Had my first visit to the Saucer a few weeks ago for a Trivia night. Beer selection is awesome and you'll find the prices reasonable too! Menu is great and this Cheesehead was very happy to see all the Brat menu items, including the Brat Nachos I started with! Had the chicken cheesesteak for me meal and it was pretty good, though the meat to bread ratio favored the bread.\n\nAs for Trivia - they run a tight ship and it's a blast! The MC is really good and calls out all potential cheaters. Love it! I'll be back again soon when I'm in the University Area."
"1","What a lousy experience.  Perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular Hertz Gold customer I was astonished at the disorganization of this facility. Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.  Finally after 20 mins a second person came to help  After a significant wait I was asked if I really needed a full-sized car as requested.  Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight. \n\nFirst of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross. \n\nAnd then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz. If I didn't have TSA per-check Or had to check a bag, I'm not sure I would have made my flight. \n\nTotally unacceptable service - that's an oxymoron with Hertz Charlotte."
"1","Yet another Hertz location that doesn't have cars for reservations.  Ridiculous wait as they make us sit here waiting for returns to come in.  Seriously, take a taxi.  #hertz"
"1","My wife and I didn't have the best of Labor Day week ends. First her car over heats Saturday night and we have drop it off at a garage for repair. She borrows my car which decides to shred its back tire Sunday night during a raging thunderstorm and no one open to fix it because its a holiday week end,so we are now without a vehicle.\nMy wife reserves a car on line and no where on the website does it say you have to have a major credit card to rent car. Our daughter picks us up and we drive 45 minutes to the airport and wait in line only to be told when we present our debit card that we need a major credit card to rent a car. WTF!! A debit card is the same as cash and we are being turned down for a car rental???\nMy wife informed the clerk that she had used this same debit card in other cities to rent car while she was on business trips and at this point he takes a condescending attitude and told us we were not renting a car with a debit card.\nI kept my cool until the clerk starting waving my wife's debit card in our face and treating us like we were white trash because we did not have a credit card.\nAt this point both my wife and I lost it and I profanely told him what I thought of him and Enterprise care rental. My wife snatched her debit card out of his hand and we stormed out mad as hell.\nMy wife and I do not have nor care to have a major credit card. If we can not pay cash for something, we do not buy it.\nI cannot believe in todays world a company will not take a debit card for a purchase.\nIf Enterprise was the last car rental place on the face of the earth and we don't have a car, we will walk rather than rent from them!"
"1","The chicken wings are great. Everything else was ugh. I had the shrimp with broccoli which by the way was mostly broccoli and the rice tasted like pool water. Never again!!"
"1","I ordered General Tso's chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly sub-par. The chicken was tangy and had an off taste. The rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked.  Also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average. I will not be ordering from this place ever again and I would strongly tell anyone I know not to order from there either."
"2","The first time my husband brought me here for dinner I thought he was out of his mind. I'm so glad i kept an open mind. It took me a few visits to find my favorite entree and now that I have I'm addicted. My new favorite meal is the arroz con camarones (Shrimp w/ rice). The onions are sweet and the shrimps are flavorful. Yum. Of all the times I have visited Miguel's I have never had a bad experience. The servers are always attentive and nice. Definately give it a try!!"
"2","Wow... The best Mexican restaurant in the country.    My advise to you making a connection in Charlotte airport.   Take the lastest contraction, take a cab here for lunch or dinner than go back to the airport.  It's worth the layover.    It's 5 minutes from the airport."
"1","Mixed review: chips and salsa were good, atmosphere good. I was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada. My food, vegetarian burrito/cheese enchilada combo, was really basic and had no imagination in flavor. I was hoping to get a taqueria style burrito but what I got was small and boring flavor. The guacamole was tasteless and frozen, previously made. It was shameful that they serve that. Outdoor seating option was cool and it was very popular."
"1","Good bread, but steakums do not a cheesesteak make. Stick with cold subs."
"2","I enjoyed every dish I have had there. I'm a huge fan of their General Tso's chicken and egg drop soup. They have some amazing dishes, and they pile your plates with food."
"2","I have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch (they don't do dinner). The waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars b/c they were all being called by name - nice touch. \n\nI ordered coffee (black), two eggs, country ham with biscuit and grits. The food came out in about 5 minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot. The menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local. The coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water. \n\nI love places like this, look bad from the outside, inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats, no frills, but the food was very good. \n\nPrice was right too. I will go back :-)"
"2","If your're looking for a country breakfast, this is the place!\n\nEggs the way you like them.\nThey serve up a great cup of coffee and an excellent country breakfast.\nThey serve breakfast till 11am.\n\nThey have a good lunch menu too.\nThe Greek salad is one of the best I've ever had.\nBurgers, Cheese Steaks and sandwiches.\n\nThey also have real good sweet tea!\nServing since 1957."
"2","great local business, servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually. this is a strange little spot but so good. everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight. one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast!! :) ive heard great things! my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu..."

"2","I have to say this eastern Carolina BBQ is some of the best I have had since when I was a child living in Greenville NC. My granddaddy use to take us to his favorite BBQ place just across the Tar River near the airport almost every Sunday for dinner. Living in Florida I don't get this type of 'Q down there. So when I am in Charlotte I make it a point to eat here. Twice now and counting."
"1","So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\"" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward."
"1","Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day."
"1","Horrible service. Terrible showroom from 1980. Poor attitude by employee. $17 bucks for two balloons, which the employee self proclaimed he didn't know how to inflate with the helium tank. \n\nLet it fold so another small business can have the spot and contribute to the community."
"1","Stopped by tonight with a friend. We both ordered bottled beers. My bottle came with a \""Best consumed before May 11, 2011\"". My friend's beer had a due date of November 8. I returned my beer and ordered a draft. The waiter did discount my order, but I was really disappointed in their quality control. Not sure if this was an isolated incident, but the whole experience left a bad taste."
"1","So bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review. Went for lunch with family (wife and 3 young boys). We've learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious. First off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen in/out door. Next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table. Then when asked what the specials were I was told \""um, not sure let me check\"". My food (turkey club) was eatable but my wife \""salad\"" consisted of brown lettuce. The kicker is that my boys (2 and 4) didn't eat their hotdogs because they tasty \""yucky\"". How can you mess up a hot dog????  Seems to be a good place to grab a beer and watch a game, just don't eat."
"1","I wish I had read the previous review first.  My boyfriend and I were craving a Cajun Chicken biscuit for breakfast so he picked it up and brought it home.  The chicken was so dry, hard and overcooked it was like chicken jerky & didn't even taste anything like it should.  We were so disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didn't offer us a better one or anything free next time.  It was just a waste of $10 because we couldn't eat it.  They probably won't get my business again!"
"1","No matter how often I'm there, the staff is horribly rude - not just to me but to every customer. If I ever find another place to take children's items, I will not return. There is no excuse for the ugly attitude and behavior to everyone."
"2","this place is solid,  you will never feel ripped off, ever."
"2","My friend and I went last night to Bombay Grille. We started with samosa (she ordered and oh boy what a good choice). They are very filling and come as two big pieces. I ordered chicken palak. It's quite tasty but a little spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was very prompt in refilling my drink. The garlic naan was sooo yummy! I can eat that for dinner with the sauce of Chicken Palak. I wish this place only 10 minutes away from my home..."
"2","I can only comment on carry out. \n\nI have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places."
"1","Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.\n\nI ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!\n\nAs I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \""You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\"" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \""I want to have room for my Pad Thai\"".  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\n\nThe Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \""dumpling\""."
"2","We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.\n\nI thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great flavors and think it is spot on."
"1","We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations."
"2","Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son. \n\nI met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast. \n\nAnd the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! \n\nThe service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte."
"1","I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.\n\nI give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.\n\nI think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.\n\nI'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here."
"2","My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious."
"2","Great Way to Spend the 4th.\n\nBeen awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.\n\nMy wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.\n\nOnly negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.\n\nMy Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.\n\nService was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.\n\nAtmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.\n\nIf you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch"
"1","This is now called Cabo's Mexican Grill. \n\nThis is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed. The first time I went with a group of 3 other friends. The service was less than okay and food was mediocre, nothing really memorable.\n\nThe 2nd time was a couple of weeks ago, name change but the bad service stayed.\n\nWent with a group of about 8 - 10 people on a Thursday night. Right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us. We ordered drinks and our food, food took longer than what we expected even with a big group. The server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for. To make matters worse, the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed, we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked. Worst part, we were so ready to leave and couldn't, our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up. \n\nI am rating it 3 stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didn't let us enjoy it."
"2","Totally enjoyed my experience with Craig at Uptown Retreat.  All of the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  My friend and I were both in from out of town and scheduled two blow outs and one cut.  Craig was my stylist and Davis did my friends hair.  Both guys did an excellent job!  Craig you 'get it'....hair length, face shape, hair cut, and most importantly the blow out and style!  Not many stylists can bring it all together like you did! Thank you..now will you please come to my town!?!?  Oh...and I loved the corner location of your chair....had an awesome view while getting my hair did! :-)"
"1","This week, I took my son to see the \""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the INSIDES of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""small\"" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""movie-NOT-going\"" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""Let's all go to the lobby\"" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars."
"1","My new coworkers invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""cheap\"" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks."
"1","Um...no!\n\nChips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \""made in New York City?!?!?)\n\nI had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.\n\nOverall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.\n\nService was mediocre. \n\nMoral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome."
"1","My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\"".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......"
"1","I was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay and/or the property had updated since then, but no such luck.\n\nThe beds here are ROCKS!  It felt like I was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that.  When we \""got up\"" in the morning (that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good night's sleep, which we didn't) my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping, so it was probably very old.  Definitely not Marriott standard.\n\nWireless internet was slow, but a CAT5 was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine.\n\nBreakfast when I had it was good.  Perhaps previous reviewer came down late?  A little on the crowded side, but the biscuits were delicious.\n\nAll in all, the stay was great except for the beds, but unfortunately that's a HUGE thing that needs to be good when you're staying at a hotel.  Sorry guys."
"1","Avoid this place at all costs.  Horrifically uncomfortable mattress?  Check. Paper thin walls and a creaky floor/ceiling that sounds like others are IN your room?  Check.  Gangs if bikers partying outside your door and yet miraculously - and loudly - coming to blows in the morning?  Check.  By all that is holy, do NOT stay here.  \n\nI would give 0 stars if allowed..."
"2","The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center."
"1","I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."
"2","Well kept secret in University City. Took the kids for a day out. Very affordable prices. $5 for each game per person. 25 cents for the video games. Throwback video games (Pac-Man, Moon Patrol, Donkey Kong, Foosball, Air Hockey). 9 holes of the putt-putt are above ground, the back 9 are underground. The kids thought it was pretty cool. Great spot to get to if you want to get out with the kids or have a date night out with the missus. A+++++ Now that's what's up!!!!"
"1","We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. \n\nEating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon"
"2","This is my favorite place in charlotte, with my grandmothers nursing home across the street and me traveling all the time on an fixed amount to spend per city it's great too just sit by the pond and people watch."
"1","I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so."
"1","Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?"
"1","Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was actually pretty good. However the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying \""just 2\"". As though 2 people was not enough. Well, I can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that I don't frequent very often."
"1","This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.\n\nOrdered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.\n\nThe only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food."
"1","Everything about this place screams a budget hotel, except for the price.   This is a motel quality establishment charging upscale hotel quality prices.  \n\nGranted, the staff is nice.  And, if you need a place that allows pets, I guess this could be a good choice.   Otherwise, don't be fooled.   I have staid at other homewood suites in the past, and this one is certainly not up to par."
"2","I have this place on my Top 3 list for wings. They are the perfect standard wing if your looking for consistency they win all the time. I haven't been in a while but I'm sure when I do they will be spot on as usual. Always a great bartender at this place as well."
"2","If your a Charlotte 49'er fan, this is the place to be.\n\nThey have lot's of Charlotte memorabilia.\nThe staff is friendly, professional and knowledgable.\n\nWe went for a Saturday afternoon lunch.\n\nThe sweet tea is VERY sweet, asked for half a glass of ice water.\n\nI had the Southwest Chicken Salad, others had the Manhattan Pizza.\nMy salad was fresh and flavorful. The personal pizza was excellent as well.\n\nThey also have NTN trivia if you like playing on-line.\n\nThis place probably rocks during hoops season and should be a destination once the 49'ers start their football season.\n\nThey have a hugh projection screen TV and all the requisite HD Plasamas"
"2","Great place to watch a game, and banging wings!  What else could you want."
"1","o sole mio.. o sole mio... \n\nI forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank..\nSays a lot about this chain restaurant.  While it does not dissapoint, it is not memorable at all.\n\nThe hostess was kinda grumpy. We had an extra person , and she had to move us.. and she was all huff and puff.. I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad?\n\nAnyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here.."
"1","Thought the staff was incredibly rude. With out anyone else in the restaurant, my party of four was asked to wait. After we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together. My seafood portofino dish had about a cup of  oiling the bottom of the plate"
"2","STAFF:  The most kind hotel staff I've had the chance to meet.  Atmosphere was down to earth, professional and efficient.  A well oiled staff no matter who was at the front desk.  All policies stayed the same from person to person.\n\nI'd like to make special mention of Joe (staffer), who didn't rush me off but listened to my request and immediately went into action to do research and obtain information about relocating to the area.  Joe was a positive person and nothing but a gentleman.  Southern hospitality DOES still exist!\n\nFACILITY:  NO noise!  I mean absolutely no noise from the hall or surrounding rooms.  Parking was plentiful and easily accessible; no long walks to your car.  The parking lot was well lit and I observed no shenanigans during my week stay.  \n\nCONVENIENCE STORE:  A pretty neat concept where you purchase necessities (Tide, Chips, Soda, etc.) and you are billed - - All on the Honor System!  Sweet!\n\nROOM:  The room was clean and smelled good.  I am very particular about cigarette smoke!  The bed slept like a Dream!  The room was spacious.  The full kitchen was convenient; included a refrigerator, stove, microwave, pots/pans, dishes, glasses, coffee cups and to go coffee cups, colander and a pyrex dish for microwavable items.\n\nMy only complaint was that I had NO cell service whatsoever while in the room to which I asked one of the hotel staff and they immediately asked if I had SPRINT which I do.  Wowzers!  That's definitely going to be another review.  Humpf!\n\nOverall my 7 day stay felt like I was right at home and it can't get any better than that!"
"2","I'll cut right to the tender, juicy heart of Longhorn...its a great chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to shame.  Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my mind than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell people about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, \""Why don't you just go to Outback??\""  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...\n\n*Steaks are always juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).  \n\n*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.  \n\nThere's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.  Reasonable prices, great food, and awesome service...what else do you need?"
"1","I seem to always get up sold whenever I go to an Autobell. The problem is, I spend more money thinking I will get better service but it is never the case with autobell. This location was no different. Stick with the normal cleaning packages and it is well worth the money. Buy their upgrades and it is a waste."
"1","We went here for lunch last week. The place is very small, cramped. They only have like 4 little tables that seat two people and one that sits four. The place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the Galleria area. Service was slow and kinda confusing.\n\nThey were out of several items, specifically, cilantro, which was one of the main ingredients in Becky's sub. The problem wasn't that they were out, but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in mid-production.\n\nMine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub, it was barely warm.\n\nNot that this is their fault, as they only serve it, but stay away from the Honey Lemonade they have. It's disgusting.\n\nThe place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized. The staff were friendly. The two main sandwich guys spoke very little English so I had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks. To boot, they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth. Not major, but noticeable.\n\nNot awful, but they can improve."
"2","This Goodwill is probably the busiest in Charlotte and has above-average selection in each dept.  They have good variety of clothes, shoes, books, furniture, and housewares.\n\nThe selling point at this store (as you might have guessed by reading my views) is the book selection.  Unlike other stores, they have a steady rotation of new titles, nearly new for really cheap.\n\nI'm regularly surprised by their furniture selection.  If my house wasn't cluttered like your grandma's crib, I would pick up a table or even a couch here!  Also, this place is freakin' Mecca for used appliances.  I always see a selection of used microwaves, coffee makers, and blenders.  The clothes are nice, not as nice as the Matthews Plantation, but you can still find some amazing deals on brand name clothes.  \n\nPlease be warned: Saturdays is NOT a good day to shop due to crowds of crying, screaming children.  Plus, you wouldn't want to get in altercation with aggressive shoppers over a $1 beer stein.  Try a weekday before 6 or so.  Happy treasure hunting!"
"2","Pizza has a great flavor and the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce has Great Flavor, only too little sauce!  If you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot!  The service here is always very good!  I have to say I'm a fan because I eat here more than any Italian place!"
"1","I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though."
"1","We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.\n\nWe will never return."
"2","This is a great bar if you have kids.... I know that sounds weird but listen. They have a beach  and tiki bar in the rear with cornhole, beer pong, ping pong, horseshoes etc.... They have a stage out there for live music. Big portions of food for not alot of cash. Becoming a Friday night tradition"
"1","I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a \""welcome\"" packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!"
"1","Tried again and it was worse.  I didn't like it.  Ordered a combo plate beef burrito, soft taco and tostada. Took most of it home to try and remake it but it was hopeless. Just not good food."
"1","Only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order. Chili verde was ok but not worth $11. Husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland."
"2","Unlimited hot coffee. I don't have any recollection of what I ate....\n\nI wanted t give it four stars, but that would be a very generous review for a meal I cannot recall.\n\nI know it was decently good, and it's like the only restaurant in Deforest.\n\nFor that, I give it four stars."
"1","there should be a negative rating on here.  one star is way to high.\ni am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution? KEEP RESETTING THE BOX... YES IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE I GET MY SERIVCE ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S NOT THEIRS TO MAKE SURE IT WORK.  Plus they have poor customer service but I don't blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime it's customers. \n\ncharter is horrible and since i coudn't get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth.  Charter is the worst."
"1","Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this."
"1","Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. \n\nI know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.\n\nI won't be going back."
"1","I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. \n\nFor starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.\n\nImperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons."
"2","I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges. Delicious! The guacamole was decent, though a little bland. And my husband's mole sauce was just OK. But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.\n\nThe service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK. Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it.\n\nBut what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect. Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor. I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort. Yum!"
"1","I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers."
"2","Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting, but I must say this place really was quite impressive. Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors, all served hot and with a smile. What more could you ask for?"
"1","This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows."
"2","I took my car here to get my brakes replaced.  They did the work quickly and at a good price.  I went here on a recommendation from a friend, and now I recommend it to my friends when they need work done."
"2","4 stars for Hardee's ?!?  It's no Culver's by a long shot but that Thick Burger was damn tasty !   I don't know if the restaurant was clean but the drive thru service was good."
"1","Does not live up to a recent review in Madison paper.  \nCons: Too pricey & ala carte.  The pasta dishes in range $15- $20. The entrees: $20 - 30. The decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty. Server forgot to put in some of our order.  My ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor.  Need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread & oil.\nPlus: Nice people.  Good Tuscan mushroom soup.\nFor the tiny storefront, family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations.  It would be fine for your corner Italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their $$."
"1","DO NOT GO HERE! Had my oil changed on 12/2/14. As I left the lot I pulled out onto University Ave and my car immediately died. I turned around and headed back to Jiffy Lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change. They took my car and \""said\"" they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad. They immediately said \""we have a guy, would you like us to call him?\"" I felt like I was being scammed, how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change I now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery? I declined their offer to \""call their guy\"" and decided to take the chance and drive home. \n\nOnce home, i took my car to my local garage, which I should have done in the first place, and they informed me that Jiffy Lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil. Considering all Jiffy Lube does is change oil, I feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep. So, the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of BS and all they wanted to do was scam me into having \""their guy\"" fix my unbroken car, which probably would have cost me an arm and leg. Shame on you Jiffy Lube! Just remember, someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one, you can bet I will be sharing this bad one!"
"2","I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!"
"2","My wife's Mini Cooper had to have its engine replaced. She no longer felt comfortable driving that car. We visited Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with Zimbrick VW in Middleton. Otto was very helpful. He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.\n\nZimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day. He even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car!\n\nWhen I replace my Toyota RAV4, I will definitely consider Zimbrick VW."
"1","I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it. \n\nI prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait."
"1","This review is strictly based on the Sun Prairie location and is only a review on the service received, not the food. I have had Papa Murphy's pizza at other locations and the pizza was good. Unfortunately at this location I wasn't given a chance to get a pizza. I walked into the store at 5 minutes to 8pm. 8pm is when they close. Not only did my phone, my car, and my watch indicate that it was before 8pm but the actual clock inside the store was showing 7:55. I soon as I walked into the restaurant I was told that they were closed even though there was another customer in the store getting a pizza as well. You don't even bake the pizza! How much effort would it have been to take one more order and make one more pizza? The total transaction could have been done and it still probably wouldn't have been 8! It's not like the store had already been cleaned and it would have been a hassle to reopen everything. I would have been completely understanding of that. There are a lot of pizza options in sun prairie. Go there."
"1","Found  hair in my food.  BLECH!!  Never ever again!"
"2","Classic, just like you remember.,,,,\n\nPerhaps, like me, you remember trips to the A&W as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous, frosty mug of sweet, cold root beer as a special treat.  I remember agonzing over the decision, ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer (parents wouldn't let us have both). \n\nI hadn't stopped into an A&W in a long, long, time and was looking for something a little less fast-foody on my drive south when I decided to stop at this A&W.  I've driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from Minneapolis to Madison but had never before stopped in.\n\nI got a burger and fries, which were fine, but the real treat was a real frosty mug (eat in only) that I could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel A&W root beer.  Now that was a really something special."
"2","When I was younger, my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in Kenosha, WI.  We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.  \n\nWhen I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.  The one we selected was the Mousehouse Cheesehaus, chosen mostly for it's cute sign and awesome name.  Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.  The woman working at the counter didn't seem too charmed by my friends and I, but I'm sure I would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while, myself."
"1","Although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the food I got was not very good. After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon. Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/crab rangoon  should be. Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat. *note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on. The person that said the food was too sweet was right. Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no \""zip\"" at all. Take it for what it's worth, but I know I will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on."
"1","The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  \n\nThe first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.\n\nThe menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath."
"2","A new friend suggested I check out Rebecca Lynn Studio; he is balding, and said \""if they can make me look good, imagine what they can do for you!\""  So I popped in one day for a cut--literally called em up and drove right on over, no wait!  \n\nThe place is clean and cute, and they have wet stations which means you don't have to traipse back and forth across the salon for a wash, they just spin you around and viola!  \n\nDan cut my hair, and he was friendly and personable.  He really asked me how I liked my hair cut, what tools to use, etc., since I know \""my hair best.\""  My hair can be a little difficult to work with, so I really appreciate that he took the time to ask.\n\nAnother great bonus: 1 week guarantee on the cut.  If I didn't like it, I could come back for a redo or even get my money back.  Got the cut on Monday and was back on Friday for some tweaking, which I'm glad I did, but even better to know the offer was there.  \n\n$23 for a haircut is a wonderful deal, but beware: CASH ONLY!  They also do styling, hair color, perms, nails, waxing and make up.  They are an Aveda salon (but not a concept salon).\n\nI haven't decided yet to keep seeing Dan, or back to Robyn at Cha Cha, but I would recommend Rebecca Lynn Studio to anyone looking for a great deal on great service.  As of 4/13 they were going to be closed for 10 days to remodel, so be sure and call ahead."
"2","I had a great experience here! Very friendly. Very informative. She made me feel comfortable and able to say what I want my hair to look like. I will definitely go there again! Highly recommend."
"1","I could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time). \n\nIt took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service. \n\nSo I finally got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated). \n\nI went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers. The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy). \n\nSo not a great visit but not the worst, either."
"1","Nice atmosphere. Cheeseburger was not all that."
"1","terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead."
"2","At my first visit this month, Dr. Radke and her assistants were wonderful. I never had to wait long and most importantly, Radke really addressed my eye allergies (a new phenomenon for me as a recent Wisco resident) and pointed me toward some new contacts that are AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE!\n\nI really like that they offer Optomap as an alternative to dilating your eyes. It isn't covered under insurance but the cost is well worth avoiding dilation eye drops in my book."
"1","I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place.  But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs.\n\nANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it.  I am always expecting this transcendent experience, but really, all I get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper."
"1","Overall felt like the food lacked flavor. The jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us. The BBQ shrimp and cornbread were both good."
"1","This West location is now CLOSED.   Owner would like to reopen in the future."
"1","Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos."
"1","Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place. Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food. I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen. Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu. The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables. I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes."
"1","I was bringing my family to Cracker Barrow today a group of 6 but after hearing they fired a 73 year old Vet for handing out a Corn muffin I changed my mind...... I hope others feel the same way......"
"2","I am reviewing specifically the Chicago Hot Dog Cart in this Home Depot. I Love it! \nWho in their right mind does not want to go to a store on a Saturday afternoon shop and then have one of the best Hot Dog's in Madison? \n\nI'm just saying for $3.00 I can have a Chicago style hot dog loaded with all the fixins' including a kosher pickle. It's great.\n\nMy wife gets the chili dog and swears by it. She also has said on multiple occasions at the Home Depot that the chili dog is one of the best in the area. \n\nWho would guess that a small little hot dog stand sitting in the Home Depot was so awesome! \n\nI'm telling you, instead of running out to your car to drive back home and think about doing your weekend warrior projects, take a minute and snag a hot dog at the cart located inside the entrance of Home Depot.\n\nVienna Dogs, true Chicago dog style! Great hot dog!"
"1","Another chain sit down by the mall,  but not at the top of my list. The food hasn't seemed to change since I've gone here except for less options.  Waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times. Recently got a burger there. Asked for well done,  and burger arrived bloody and red.  Waiter took it back and about 5 minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside.  Was offered something else,  but the others I was with were already done.  Did get a coupon for a return visit. Good deal with the 2 for $20 and an app if your food is cooked right."
"2","The Bridges has become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite."
"1","I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath \""oh shit.\"" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.\n\nSure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.\n\nOh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool."
"2","I don't live quiiiiite close enough for this to be MY neighborhood bar, but it meets all the requirements: laid-back atmosphere, great food, and seriouslygreatcraftbeerlist. Their beers are all of the cant-pick-up-at-the-gas-station variety and it's worth coming by just for that--the menu diversity is the cherry on top of my craft beer float."
"1","Used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through Madison. We generally aim more for Country Inn or Hampton... but this was the best deal.  At check-in I was told they only had king beds left,  though the parking lot was quite empty.  When we got to the room there were no sheets for the hide-a-bed. We went to the front desk and asked for some. We were told that the security guard would bring them up. 45 minutes later (it was close to 12:30 am at this point) we had to call and remind them. \n\nThe room was pretty rough. Lots of ding marks on the doors and trims. The light over the mirror didn't work. Things were just worn out.  The bed had clearly seen better days.  Crowne gives you these silly \""relax packs\"" with aroma therapy stuff.  A good bed would do more for making me relaxed. \n\nIn general I wasn't impressed.  We'll stick with Country Inn & Hampton inns."
"2","This place is huge, and that is good because it can get packed pretty quickly on the weekends. This is especially true when the weather outside forces us to look for indoor activities. \n\nUnlike the previous poster, I initially had a hard time figuring out the computer seated at the table. I kept jamming my fat little fingers onto the screen expecting a touch screen response. Fortunately the other bowlers in my party realized that my genius was showing and helped me figure it out. Durrrrrr. \n\nThe bowling was fun, even though I probably should have had the bumpers on like the minors in our group did. At least then I would have not looked liked the biggest dork in three counties, just a weeny. \n\nWe ordered deep fried cheese curds, and deep fried macaroni for snacking. No healthy eating here!!! They were yummy, and just as good as Culver's. But since I've said that, now I'll have to hide from rabid Culver's fans. Yikes! \n\nWe'll go here again, and I can once again provide comic relief with my mad bowling skillz. \n\nWerd."
"1","The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service.  Somebody teach these people some customer service.  I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high.  The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof.\n\nI've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl...  that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine...  Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here."
"2","Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Has always been one of my favorite diners in Mad-town.  Delicious veggie chili, spicy cornbread, malts and desserts, as well as the amazing array of other veggie options.  Just yesterday, I tried the new Spinoccoli Quiche with fruit, which was pretty darn good...coffee is always hot and refills frequent.  Still have yet to try the famous zucchini pancakes, but next time, I must.  I must also remember to save room for dessert!  Look forward to returning sooner than later to try some of the other new lunch options on the menu.  Only downer is the wait/lack of parking on a busy day.  Overall, two thumbs up from me, Monty."
"2","I've been to Monty's at least once for every meal. The omelettes are to die for, huge in quantity unique in ingredients- highly recommend the spinach and feta. The salads are the same thing, definitely large and delicious. Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me correctly, it was cashew...) to put on EVERYTHING. Amazing shakes and malts complete the perfect comfort/diner food experience."
"1","Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options.  Food is just okay, not great.  Makes me wonder why everyone likes Food Fight so much."
"2","If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection....I can't rave enough.\n\nThe meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis. It's that good.\n\nSome of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid. Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit.\n\nYay Monty's!"
"1","If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back."
"2","One of my favorite places to eat.   Zucchini Pancakes are awesome!!!  We mostly eat breakfast here but I'm sure lunch and dinner are just as good."
"2","Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.\n\nAlso a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in."
"2","Tried this place based upon the Yelp reviews. My girlfriend & I had hamburgers. I also had a salad with the best 1000 island dressing I've ever had.  My girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them. They quickly brought her a new one. We finished up with a huge Turtle sundae we shared. Caution: this sundae is not for only one person.\n\nOur service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush (430pm), so seating was easy. At 6pm, the place had a significant queue, but it was a Saturday night and the Barrymore had an event. \n\nOverall, the fare, the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try."
"2","Food is consistently good. We often go for weekend brunch. I'm from NJ, which has a lot of 24 hour diners. This is one of the only places in Madison that offers breakfast all day, so it's great in my book. Don't come if you mind long lines or kids; do come if you like yeasted doughnuts!"
"2","Fabulous food and AWESOME atmosphere. Perfect place to take your kids or have a little date. ;) The only thing that is upsetting is that once you fall in love with something on the menu, it always gets taken off. I have had probably 3 or 4 dishes that I have loved over the years that are just no longer available."
"1","Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there."
"1","I have only been here a few times. Service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes. First time I got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the 6 bucks. I looked forward to having another some day. Last Friday I went there for another shake and it was really thin. Like chocolate milk! Maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results. $6 is way too much for a watery shake. Get it together people."
"2","Everyone already knows how awesome Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook \""real\"" food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.\n\nHowever, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. \n\nNow drop everything and order this curry!\n\nAnd order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too."
"1","I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish."
"2","So good!!! We went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered.  The food was very reasonably priced!! Yum!"
"2","I like the food and donuts, but and more importantly, I really like the people who run this place and the people who hang out there."
"1","Maybe the most disorganized store I have ever seen. Now, add that in with trying to bring my dog with me into this store...Pure Chaos. \n\nMy last visit (of many I've made to this PetSmart) made me realize that I'm better off heading to either Fleet Farm or Tabby and Jacks to get whatever I may be looking at locally for my dog.  \n\nI enjoy the fact I can walk my dog into the store to get what I need, but when I head to the footwear isle to find nothing for medium to large dog sizes I get a little irritated. \nDo the employee's working here know how to stock the shelves? Why are all the socks and footwear thrown all over the bottom shelf of the clothing isle? \n\nNot everyone has a 10 lb dog. I'm not even asking much. I have a 48 lb English Bulldog and I still could not find anything in his size. \n\nThe last thing I want to do is sift through items thrown all over the floor and shelf. Forget it! \n\nI asked a employee if they carried socks for medium to large size dogs  (their website says this store does have these items in stock) and instead of even helping me sift through their ridiculous isle I was told, \""What you see if what we have\"". \nCome on Man!!!!! Really? Is this your best customer service?\n\nNot sure If you will be seeing much more of me and my Bully anytime soon coming back in here."
"2","Lots of fun, little bit of cash. \n\nThese games are great for getting a bit of fresh air, hanging with a few friends, drinking a(few) brews, and munching on some ballpark goodies. VERY family friendly, but still fun for those of us who don't know who the hell the Jonas Brothers are. \n\nI personally have never been in the Duck Blind, but I hear it's over-rated.\n\nBring sunscreen if you're on the third-base line!!!"
"2","I have a new found love for Indian food and when I found myself in Madison I had to check this place out. It was most excellently delicious! The staff was very nice and the price for 3 people including 4 drinks and an appetizer was about $75. If you ever find yourself on the East side of Madison, you should really check this place out."
"1","Here's the lowdown:\n\nThey're like every other shop that makes you take it in the Chili Ring. They only did the bare minimum amount of work possible to align my vehicle. I know a lot about alignment, I would have done it myself if I had access to the equipment. They only adjusted the Toe-in, and reported back that the bolt which actuates the upper control arm eccentric was frozen so they couldn't make the adjustment to the caster angle. \n\nI then informed Jr. Pinhead that I have a Benzo-matic torch and can heat the bolt to loosen it, which he replied that his tech had use a torch on all the bolts. Funny thing is in the report from the equipment, all the angles were within spec that would have required heat to loosen the adjustment hardware, with the exception of the 'frozen' one.\n\nI used to work at a Firestone and I thought that lazy shit was just at my location. I was expecting this type of work from a local shop with a couple of random dopers.... not Firestone"
"1","Famous Dave's is so much better!! I use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it, i don't know what happened but there food really went down the drain... the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning. I think Jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door."
"2","A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.\n\nThe place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \""warm\"", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \""yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\"".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \""you know, that was REALLY good!\""\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)"
"1","Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.\n\nHere's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.\n\nHere's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)\n\nFor us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me."
"1","My previous review was for an oil change, which I still stand by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket). The mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers.  \n\nI called around and was quoted $200 to replace the pipe at Speedys Muffler. When I brought it in there to get it replaced, they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $45. \n\nMake sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that Chet's didn't consider."
"2","I usually take my car to the Honda center for maintenance, but thought I would try a locally owned shop, and found The Chet's Car Care  had excellent reviews. The staff was very friendly, and the service was excellent. I will definately stay with The Chet's Car Care for all of my car's needs!"
"2","One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. \nIt's quick (once you're seated).\nIt's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).\nIt's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).\nIt's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).\nIs it super local? Super sustainable?\nNo.\nIt's a diner. \nBut a delicious one.\nAnd there are planes!"
"2","Big plus: the baggage claim is RIGHT next to the rental car stations. WELL DONE MADISON. \n\nBig minus: you have to walk to a giant, hard-to-navigate parking lot to find your car/rental company. Recall that 6 months out of the year the weather can be COLD.\n\nEdge: friendly staff. Even though they sneak a cig on the walk from the desk to the lot. Gotta keep it real."
"1","I hate giving 1-star reviews, but I'm not sure how else to rate the overall experience.\n\nThe Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.\n\nI arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. \n\nThe employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could \""saw\"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.\n\nBecause of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.\n\nEven more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. \n\nReturning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was \""f-ing out of here\"" because he had \""the longest f-ing day of his life\"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. \n\nI now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future..."
"1","For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment. \n\nMaybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck...\n\nLike RB, I also had an issue with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker. Really? \n\nAnyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up."
"1","Don't go to this store!  The service is always poor: the people working there are unfriendly, don't know what they are selling, where anything is located, and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged.  So if you do go you best check your receipt.  Plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy.  Sure they have the food I want but I can get it in a different \""friendly\"" store.  Lose the attitude!  What ever happened to good quality customer service?"
"1","For tax levys, late paperwork, and apologies after the fact, come to Sorge!  We had every penny in our accounts levied by the state because Sorge didn't do what they agreed to do in a timely manner.  In fact, they never did it at all, just \""forgot about it!\""  Wife is 8 months pregnant and ALL of our money (thousands) we saved for the baby coming is gone!"
"2","I drove by this place many times...looking at the all-you-can-eat tue and thur meals.  Well I finally took the bait.  As I entered the place, I was surprised with amount of items on the walls...I thought it was in good taste, but I am sure others will find it tacky.  The food was above average but not the best I have ever had.  The chicken was smokey and moist...the ribs were good, but a few on the dry side.  Waitstaff very nice and attentive.  Great night...I'll be back."
"1","Barely OK. Service was flat out terrible. It's always bad when your server throws another server under the bus for taking 5 minutes to get service after sitting down...not impressed. Service throughout the meal was extremely slow and it took 30 minutes to just get our food (for 2 people). \n\nThe food is OK. Not even close to the best in Madison. The ribs were very dry and tough. The flavor of the rub was good however. The BBQ sauce on the table was also very good. \n\nWill not be going back."
"1","Actually to the last reviewer, yes they do run on a rigid schedule here, if your even 5 minutes late your skipped and have to reschedule. I've been with uw system now for about 2 yrs since my employers plan switched us from Dean.  And I have to say I miss dean so much. Better service, friendlier doctors, the list goes on. This opinion also applies to most of their clinics ( urgent care, optometry, psychology, hospital/ER)"
"2","Yes, I am reviewing a Starbucks. \nThe reason for this review was for the exceptional service I received here this past weekend. \nMy wife has been saving the points up on her Starbucks rewards card (a gold card). It turns out that you have to cash in free drinks within 30 days on your card now, and they can not be stored and used when ever you like.\nSo instead of have multiple free drinks on her card for us to use, we only had 1 free one.\nThe employee at the counter explained this new rule to us, and still hooked us up with a second free drink any size/ any kind of our choice. \nIt was truly awesome customer service!\nSo thank you lady employee behind the register this last Easter Sunday around noon.\n\nOther things I noticed about this Starbucks, it was very clean, a well organized pastry/muffin area.\nThere is no drive thru, so that kinda sucks.\nI counted at least 3 people working behind the counter, so staffed properly.\nOur drinks were made quick and tasted great!\n\n4 out of 5 only because it is a Starbucks and there are just so many of them (its not original). \nAgain, excellent customer service!"
"2","We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""20 minutes until closing time.\"" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out."
"2","We go there for most of our fresh foods, it doesn't have the feel of a neighborhood grocer but the quality and selection are terrific."
"1","The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park. \nSo, here is why it is bad.\n1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.\n2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals.\n3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.\n4) their customer service is awful\nI don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here."
"1","Um. It's okay, I guess. They have food at decent prices, but the isles are narrow, everything needs a good cleaning and repainting, and it just felt dark and depressing. Otherwise it's all right, but I don't plan on returning here."
"2","I have been to The Ultimate several times for massages with Ellen and would highly recommend her.  She is very personable, friendly and professional.  I feel extremely relaxed after our sessions.  I also used Ellen for a prenatal massage when pregnant. Being as big and uncomfortable as I was, I was worried if I would be able to relax fully.  Ellen has blankets and pillows just for that reason! Super comfortable and she remembers to ask about the baby after she was born. Highly recommend!\n\nThe only reason I did not give 5 stars was that the hallway outside the room can get a bit loud if people are walking down, talking or laughing. They should maybe make that more of a quiet space with notices that people are in session.  Nothing Ellen could help though!"
"1","Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.\n\nTheir advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The \""service\"" at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.\n\nOrdered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn't make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.\n\nI cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time."
"1","We chose to go to Tully's II instead of going to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \""Please Seat Yourself\"".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town."
"1","I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.\nGeneral Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!\n\nI'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week. \n\nSo yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn."
"1","I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \""No, I already got this half full bowl.\""\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back."
"1","These guys rip you off. I had a coupon for an oil change, fluid top off, and a tire rotation.  I have a scratched rim on my car so I know where it was they said they rotated my tires when in fact they didn't. Total losers"
"1","This review is SOLELY for the flavor Waffle Cone.\n\nBoring.  It has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it.  First, there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it.  It was not a fun and interesting mix of add-ins.  \n\nI like their vanilla ice cream, this flavor did nothing for it."
"2","I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.  \n\nEach location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.\n\nThis location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.\n\nThe only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.  It could get fixed.  If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru."
"2","Called this morning after I noticed my outside spigot was leaking and frozen.  Stan was very friendly and sent a team within 30 minutes.  The two guys who arrived were great and finished the repair quickly.  The talked to me in advance of doing any work and even provided cost estimates. Discussed options were and helped me decide the best course.  The cost was reasonable and I will definitely call again if I need plumbing work.\nThanks - Christine"
"1","For the all hype this places gets, it sure didn't live up to it. Sure, it was busy- what place isn't on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Rail drinks were prices right- two drinks for $6.00. I ordered the lake perch- what a DISAPPOINTMENT. If you've been to Door County/eastern WI and had perch there, don't bother with Tobys perch. It was not good. My cottage cheese was warm, and my date's \""salad\"" was lettuce with salad dressing plopped on it. No veggies, croutons- nothing. The server was nice enough, for bring so overwhelmed and busy."
"1","Nice place and I did not stay there....but think twice before holding a meeting or multi-day conference here. They have one restroom per sex and those are one seaters only! Not cool. Also, I watched a bin of garbage sit under the stairway ALL WEEK....and it never got moved. Nice...."
"2","NOTE:  I only just got my car back so I cannot yet comment on the long-term resilience of the paint job.\n\nMy wife bought a new VW Passat in December and was hit by a dump truck in January. There was body damage to the driver-side front door, back door and rear quarter panel. Our insurance is with Geico who has an agent that works right out of ABRA's office. So I took it there for an assessment.\n\nEveryone was extremely kind and helpful. The process of getting the estimate both by Geico and by ABRA was very quick and easy. Also, ABRA was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime. Enterprise came out to ABRA's location and we took care of the rental there.  All I paid for was the insurance which was like $12-13/day.\n\nABRA sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time, the let me know that as well.\n\nI dropped it off on Tuesday, January 21 and they completed all the repairs and paint on Friday however I couldn't pick it up until Monday, January 27 as the paint needed to dry.  The car looks excellent!"
"2","The staff at Urbana Tire Company have always been very friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful.\n\nThey always provide real timely service at an affordable price and they don't give you the run-around with repair costs or deadlines.\n\nThey are located close enough to downtown Urbana that if you drop off your car you can take a peaceful stroll down Main street, maybe stop by the book store, or drop into any one of the dining/drinking establishments to have a cool beverage and a tasty bite to eat while your car gets fixed."
"2","We have been going to Caring Hands with our dogs and cats for many years.  Dr. Curt saw us through the aging and passing of two cats and a dog, all well into old age with great quality of life.  \n\nDr. Curt also saw us through the adoption of a new dog, who has a specialized problem: an urge to eat every inedible object and substance he encounters.  At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.\n\nDr. Rebecca is also an outstanding vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.  We have now seen Dr. Rebecca many times for the regular care of the \""dog who lived\"" and the newest addition to our family, another rescue dog (who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems).  We trust Dr. Rebecca implicitly.\n\nThe staff at Caring Hands are also amazing -- good with people, competent at the animal health care business, loving to animals and able to calm and handle them.  The staff has low turnover, and some of them, like Gigi, have been there as long as we have.  \n\nYou could not choose a better vet service in the Champaign-Urbana and surrounding areas.  If you are at some distance in an outlying small town (as we are), they are well worth the drive."
"2","Brought my Saturn to Fairfield Automotive and I couldn't be happier. The fuel pump had a component that was cracked and they were able to repair it, rather than my purchasing the entire unit, which saved me the equivalent of my mortgage this month.\n\nI will definitely return and would recommend their service. Very personable and friendly staff, and an overall great experience."
"2","I went here today because my car needed an oil change.. badly. I'd been putting it off because I just moved here in August (am I allowed to say \""just\"" still?) and wasn't sure how to go about finding a reliable place. I chose Meineke from the five or so car places I had coupons for by looking at the reviews on yelp. For 19.95 (or a little over $22 including tax) with my coupon (basic oil change is usually 24.95) I had my oil/filter changed and the oil disposed of properly, fluids topped off, and a basic belts/tires overall inspection. The men there were so friendly and speedy! They didn't give me the runaround.. just my oil changed with a smile. I would recommend them to anybody and will be back! \nAlso, from drive up to drive away it took maybe.. 30 minutes even though there were several other cars in the garage (I went at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon)."
"1","Awful just awful, I gave them my car Thursday night at 4, I was informed a part needed ordered they would call me when finished, I called them the following Wednesday confused on why it was taking so long, I was informed it was done Friday and he thought he called me to tell me, I will not be going back, just crap service!!"
"1","Ok, this place has decent food.  Well, depending on the day.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.\n\nHowever, for a small mom and pop place, they don't seem to do much to make people feel welcome.  \n\nThe last time I ate there was the last time.  I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside.  We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.\n\nMy friend said \""I'd love it on the side, please\"" only to be told \""No.\""  When he said \""no?\"" she replied \""Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy.\""\n\nI made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back.  Problem solved, all dishes are clean!\n\nSkip it and go to Sam's cafe."
"2","Good price, matches quality"
"2","Pizza in the CU seems to be an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.\n\nStepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. \n\nOne of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.\n\nSo, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's."
"1","I'd give it a zero if I could. This place is weak as fuck. Mexican food? Please. I'd rather go to Taco Bell. There's a taco truck down the road that you're better off spending your money on."
"2","I've  reviewed another Cracker Barrel in the past, and this location lives up to the all-american constant that I've come to expect from Cracker Barrels.\nIts a tradition for my sister and I to have a meal at Cracker Barrel when I come to visit her, so we headed straight over there when I got off the train yesterday morning. I was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours!\nOur server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great. You know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it? This wasn't the case. It was all piping hot and fresh. The odds were ever in our favor."
"1","The service is awful and you will often receive things you didn't order.  The food is ok, but get it carry-out after a quick inspection to make sure they included everything you paid for."
"2","I f'in love monicals.  Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child.  However, when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face.  Cheese pizza, topped with their red dressing...so wrong, but oh so right."
"1","If you want burned pizzas, go here.  If you want to pay full price for an incomplete order, go here.  I wish I could have given them zero stars because even one star is too many!"
"2","For my 500th review, I thought about writing about beaches in San Diego, art centers in Los Angeles, cafes in New Mexico, or bookstores in Boston.  But it seemed right to focus on the Mass Transit District of Champaign-Urbana, the bus system that keeps my life in order.  \n\nI moved a month ago to Chambana, and it has quickly become apparent that I do not live in Southern California any more.  The land is flat, the wind comes sweeping through, the place is smaller in scope, and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky.\n\nEnter Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.\n\nThere's no need for a parking permit when there are countless, continuously running lines covering the entire area.  My weekday mornings find me checking my house, looking through my backpack, making sure all my stuff is in order, before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the 13 Silver South Line to campus, which runs twice an hour.  \n\nIf I'm worried about catching the bus, the MTD has a text messaging service, where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving.  Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts. :)\n\nThe website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.  I'm slightly less worried about gas prices, as it's free for university students to ride the ever-present CUMTD system. :)\n\nIn short, thank you so much, Chambana MTD for getting me where I need to go all the time, every time."
"2","Well I went to school here and loved it and I feel like I got a great education. It may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine! You just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they won't harass you to come, yet just expect you to! I loved the Big Ten games and the energy of the campus. I would never have picked a different place to spend four years!"
"2","For me, no trip to my alma matre is complete without a visit to Empire.  I doubt I can be completely objective; I love the place too much.  I mean, I've watched the family's kids grow up!  I recommend the General Tso's chicken.  The flavor of the sauce is amazing and the consistency of the chicken excellent.\n\nSit by the window and watch the campus walk by below... great location."
"1","Now that's what I call mediocre!\n\nI'm not a snob when it comes to Chinese food at all. I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.\n\nSo this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.\n\nThe couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.\n\nDon't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something..."
"1","When I went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf. Remembrance of the stomach bile stink still haunts me whenever I think of or pass by this eyesore. It was so strong I couldn't talk, listen or even think. I could hardly choke down the swill and nod to whatever crap music was playing or in rough acknowledgment of what I thought someone else was saying. WHAT DID SHE SAY? THIS PLAY DUCKLING BUCKS? Its pretty loud. \n\nNeedless to say it was also too crowded, dark and dirty. I realize that I am not exactly in their target market, being over 21 and all, but this place is just horrifically bad. Those that characterize this bar as anything but an unmitigated crap-dungeon are either lying to themselves or have never been to a decent bar."
"1","Food was pretty average.  Waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the mixed grill.  It was all chicken.  Where was the mix that was on the menu?!?  $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain.  No rice. Burnt naan.  I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)"
"1","I adopted a dog a few months ago. She is a 3 year old border collie lab mix named Lily. I know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior. I was told she was a friendly, sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals. She gets along with my cat great, but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out. She even attacked one recently. I'm positive she was abused by her previous family. Cchs didn't take great care of her either. Her pads were all torn in her front paws, which had her limping for the first few weeks, her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition, and she was too skinny. We were ready to give her back because of the strain it put us through. We have since turned her around with training and gotten her back to full health, but it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars."
"2","This place is under new management and is much improved. Huge crowds, but fast takeaway service."
"2","Man, this place is packed with moms, dads, and their UIUC-enrolled kids.  I swear, they used this location to film their latest commercial, about a college girl, her parents, and her (freeloading) roommates/friends.\n\nSometimes you gotta fill a craving, and that means waiting an hour for a table.  And all Conan O'Brien/Jim Cramer jokes* aside, it's a pretty damn good place to go for the money. And the chairs have wheels! WEEEEEE!\n\nI swear, the soup/salad/breadsticks have sprinkles of crack and MSG, they're pretty addicting.  And I'm pretty sure they use one can of Morton's salt per serving bowl of salad.\n\nTip: Make sure you ask for more salad and breadsticks as soon as you get your first batch, or the waiter will disappear until your entrees arrive.  By then, they know they got you pinned against a psychological wall, because who eats more salad with their entree?  Break past that wall of uncomfortability and continue to ask for refills until the check arrives.  Heck, ask for it after the check arrives.  It's like a glass of water - it should always be full.\n\nFYI, the sangria is f-ing expensive. BEWARE!\n\n*If you haven't seen Conan's impression of an Italian grandfather going to Olive Garden or the Conan/Cramer interview about Olive Garden, do so immediately."
"1","We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!"
"1","Went in there with high expectations, Neil Brown \""Who wants to be your jeweler!\"" never even came out of his hole in the back.  This place is over priced and will rip you off, also if you want to sell jewelry.  Don't go here!!!"
"2","Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only expensive if you're comparing Common Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages. All those little ethical steps cost money - and since the co-op is community owned, ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community, rather than in some corrupt CEO's pocket, and that's always a good thing.\n\nApart from my price-justification rant, this is the most awesome grocery store in town. Great deli with vegan options everyday and beautiful produce - often local and organic - that you can't find anywhere else."
"2","Where do you go when your washer and dryer break down?\n\nHow about Starcrest, which can boast it's own little \""study room\"" with two desks, four chairs, and free wi-fi?  That's right.  I like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors.  And no, that's not racist.\n\nThe washers are expensive--at least by my standards--$1.50 a wash, but they fit in more than your average washer.  Dryers are about 25 centers per 7 minutes, but are HUMONGONORMOUS, so all told, washing two loads of laundry came to $3 in washing and $1.75 in drying (all of it fit in that one dryer and i let it run for 49 mins).\n\nThe laundromat is clean and big, so that's a plus.  Also, the wi-fi network....is named \""Chuck likes Guys\""  Um, wow Chuck.  Thanks for letting us all know via internet.  We're very happy for you.  Seriously, perhaps a greeting card would've better.  I imagine Hallmark making the card, where the front would be a peaceful lake with the words: \""Life has some surprises.\""  Then the inside: \""Like my newfound attraction to men.\""\n\nBut since Hallmark isnt' yet that edgy, we have starcrest's wireless to make the announcements for us."
"1","The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me \""They're fine\"". I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis. Last time I use any Starcrest dry cleaning."
"1","I first went to Merry Ann's the night I craved The Home Stretch Haystack. Merry Ann's version paled in comparison. I gave them another shot a few weeks later, this time for lunch.  I ordered a blue plate special, country fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas. The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since."
"1","Service 5 stars, food 2 stars, atmosphere 2 stars. Overall 2.5 stars."
"2","This is a small, shabby-chic French restaurant serving simple french food.  The style of cooking is from the Brittany region of France (in the North) and hardier, less complex, and less delicate than the stereotypical French cuisine.  The menu is small is its a little more expensive than the average place in CU but the food we ate was tasty, filling, and a nice change.  I recommend the salmon starter and specials.  Service was relaxed and friendly but not slow.  My parents both enjoyed the coffee."
"2","Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered \""fresh\"" which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.\n\nMy husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  \n\nWe'll return."
"1","I guess there is no way to really make Amtrak improve by making a one-star review, but I think it's awful how expensive it now is to go to Chicago given the quality of the service. I live in Stockholm now and was entertaining notions of going back to Champaign to do another degree, but really...it's an isolated place if you don't have a car. It shouldn't be a big deal to go to Chicago. It shouldn't use up all my money or my patience. I've had 11 hour delays on Amtrak! Chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city. The fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the University. \n\nSweden benefits enormously from having fast, relatively cheap, and hassle-free railway. I don't have to sit on a cramped bus next to a McDonalds eating elementary school kid or endure six hour delays on a crappy train to get to places like Oslo and Copenhagen. I'm bragging now, but UIUC needs Amtrak to shape up."
"2","Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit.  You could get the best damned French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty sure he'd still point out the special.\n\nDid you read what I wrote there?  Best. Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.\n\nHow is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.\n\nBUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.\n\nMy husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around."
"1","Don't know what I ordered here but it was dirt cheap. Probably less than $3.\n\nYou get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy. There's an 80% chance that Sam could be serving you. Say hi."
"1","I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though."
"2","Decent drinks + chill atmosphere + Irish Nachos (oh God yes) + lack of sketchy people grinding on you = WIN."
"2","I love watching drunk freshman share the plate of Irish Nachos, absolutely hilarious. \n\nBurgers are great, beers good enough for a campus bar. Exactly what you expect."
"1","This is one of those places where I only go if someone else REALLY wants to go. i always get the same thing, a chicken melt with onions and peppers. I could make it better, but it's been reliable. I am not an egg person, so I guess I am missing out? Coffee is not good. Usually crowded, and service is passable."
"1","Back in CU for the holidays....boy were we disappointed. Used to love thisplace..but really gone down in quality and service. Ordered the Antipasto, which I used to enjoy when Frank was there....I got a place of lettuce with a few packaged pepperoni and NO KALAMATA olives or any type of olive at all...no pepperchoni, ,,,9 dollars and change. Absolutely terrible. Pasta was cold...Service was slow with few customers...would not be surprised if this  place closed soon. If youthink this s the ld MANZELLA..forget it...not as good or even close to what it used to be!!!!!"
"1","I've never eaten at Hardee's.\n\nI've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell."
"2","Decent!"
"2","Mike n Molly's is a great time for those looking to enjoy the variety that Champaign-Urbana has to offer. The gigs are almost always entertaining and the staff is very responsive and friendly. It's a nice place to go with a small group of friends and have a few, or even dance on Saturdays. As a college student, I think it's fantastic for my new friends that Mike n Molly's lets them in at 19+, because it's a real bitch finding other bars that do that."
"2","I'm a HUGE fan of the combination bulgogi plate.  Chicken, pork, beef...all on one plate.  I'm getting hungry for some right now.  Too bad I'm two hours away...*sigh*"
"1","I've been to A-Ri-Rang several times now and I have to say that I am not a fan. None of the dishes are particularly great, and I would even dare to say that most are vastly bland by Korean standards (my S. Korean friend really didn't like the beef bulgogi). \n\nBeing that it takes a very long time to get your food, and that finding seats for groups larger than 2 people is nearly impossible, I am not likely to return -- There are definitely better Korean restaurant in the extreme vicinity."
"1","Legendarily lame.\n\nThis place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade. Tactics include: carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food.\n\nGoing to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower. \nIt's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly. \nIt's like watching Schindler's List during a bachelor party. \nIt's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend's parent's house. \n\nNot fun at all."
"2","Love this place! Who would've thought I'd be reviewing a library?\n\nThe building is so cool and modern inside. So many places to lounge, a cafe, an outdoor area to chill, and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the children's section! With toys, puzzles, and books galore. I haven't had to buy too many books for my little one (she's 1 now!). Instead, I check out 6 to 8 books per every 4 weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape. Plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies. The instructors are so talented. They sing and read books to our babies. They also bring toys for them to play with. My little girl loves it! And loves to be with the other babies as well. Awesome!"
"1","This place is the worst. \nOf course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books...so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live. \nEvery time I walk into this library, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells wondering what rule I might break next. And God forbid they catch your child with a Goldfish cracker in the kids section...off with their heads! \nAdditionally, once it was off limits to Savoy/Mahomet residents, I felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable. \nI do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it. Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes? \nAnd the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there. I thought that was the point of a library? To excite people about reading and give FREE ACCESS TO ALL. \nChampaign \""Public\"" library (which it really isn't anymore) is truly the most unfriendly library I have ever been to and I will never go back there again."
"1","Better than most chain pizza, it's ok.  \n\nWe got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.\n\nI guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town.  It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere."
"1","I went here for their new customer cleaning discount. I made the appointment last week. I showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested. The front doors were locked, no one visible in the office, no response to knocking, no closed sign or \""Back at [clock]...\"". After pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the office's phone. A person who claimed to work for a 'sister practice' answered, confirmed my appointment, and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office. After several minutes in the rain, he told me that he could only reach an answering machine. I left.\n\nI have never been so grossly disrespected by what's purported to be a business. I have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism. This business and medical practice does not give a fig about its patients'/customers' time. Judging by the other reviews here, I clearly dodged a bullet."
"2","Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full. Good to see. Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why."
"2","Recently I visited a handful of international food stores in Champaign, IL. Far East Market was the most impressive among them. Their Produce selection was incredible. A short list includes mangos, banannas, Korean pears, luffa, eggplant, casava, clabaza squash, lotus root, galanga, plantain, daikon, dirion, and many more. There was a variety of mushrooms. They offer very fresh seafood. Other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine, canned jack fruit, pickled caggage, bamboo shoots, quail eggs, fried gluten, dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas. If you are looking for a more authentic selection of fresh foods, this is likely your best bet. The grocery store is rustic and it almost feels as though you step into an inner city market in another country when you visit Far East Market. They take both checks and cash but do NOT accept credit."
"1","Crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky.  I can't imagine why anyone would order from here.\n\nAlthough I did make a second order from here one time - New Year's Eve in fact - but that was only because the cab we had booked never showed up to bring us back home from downtown.  So, I walked here, ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house, then tried to make the delivery guy drive me AND the pizza.  Pretty smart, huh?  Too bad they wouldn't let me though.  So I canceled the ordered and kept on walking.  And walking.  And walking.  It's a long way to east Urbana from downtown Champaign.  In the cold.  On New Year's Eve."
"1","I brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well.  They ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure.  I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.  As for Animal Emergency clinic, they are boobery and nothing more.  A monkey can start and IV and give fluids, I paid HUGE money for medical management of my dog.  I do anesthesia for a living and if I performed this incompetently I would get my ass sued off for sure and I would deserve it.  I guess vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax, and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than I do evidently by what they charged.  Humans don't even get charged this much for simple IV therapy!  Totally ridiculous, take your dog, cat, parrot whatever to the U of I, they are expensive but your pet will be alive when you leave.  This place is a joke to the highest magnitude!"
"1","God help you when there's a wrestling tournament in town and you're checking out a grad program in CU.  No Union, no historic Lincoln....yes Super 8.\n\nNow, Super 8 is...a Super 8.  You are not expecting a bevy of Milanese opera singers, clad in diaphanous shawls and wet with the last cloying droplets of the spring rain, to entertain you with their siren songs in front of the tiny fireplace in the antiseptic lobby.\n\nBut, you aren't expecting to see smoking/non-smoking rooms (least if you're from California, a land where tobacco smoking results in summary execution by armed guards)--and being put up in a smoking room is not much of a boon, especially when it smells as if the entire room is an ashtray.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to the disinterested yet vaguely friendly guy at the front lobby, he pulled his head back from teh phone where he was chattin' with his ladyfriend just long enough to query, \""Hey, you want Pops to go up and Febreeze that for ya?\""\n\nHe then gestured in the general direction of a stooped, wizened gentleman, wrinkled and neat, who looked exhausted.  I gulped back shame as I reached for the doorknob to leave.  \""Um, yeah, can you Febreeze it?\""  \n\nThat night it smelled like someone had been smoking in a flowery meadow.  \n\nThe one additional star is for the free wireless in the room.  But I felt I had to taste the air, so I don't know if it really should get that extra estrella.\n\nI'm so sorry, Pops.  But thanks for the Febreezin' anyway."
"1","My fiancee and I have been putting off going back to see the University of Illinois campus for a while now. We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.\n\nThis is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue."
"2","We ate tonight at Nitaya, and our food was excellent.  I had the Pineapple Chicken Curry and my wife had a Modified Number 77.  We had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and Mango for dessert.  The only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated, but for authentic Thai, this was it.  The service was great and no problems with English understanding him or us."

"2","I just moved my daughter into an apartment for college and stumbled on Farren's. We had a great burger and ice cold beer after a long drive and move in. I had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific. Fries. onion rings and chips were all great. Service was very good. Thank you Farren's!"
"1","Based purely on service. . .  10 people (3 groups),  10 minutes,  6 empty tables,  2 servers,  0 eye contact,  0 acknowledgement to  people waiting to sit.  Horrible,  maybe burgers are good,  but I do not like being ignored."
"1","Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \""Italian\"" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \""sacra tavola\"" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \""off the boats\"" and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \""La Famiglia\"" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \""Eye-talian\"" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""fare la scarpetta\"", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""Eye-talian\"" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to."
"1","this is place is just horrible. they tried to buy my $380 coach hand purse for $3 dollars ????? are you fudging serious?! the whole store smell so bad, and the second hand clothes they well are way too expensive! DONT SELL THEM YOUR CLOTHES PEOPLE, it's just not worth the trip."
"2","Clybourne is the best student bar in Champaign. Unlike most of the other campus bars, Clybourne offers a multi-floored facility, with plenty of room for sitting, drinking, and dancing. Prices are awesome! Thursdays feature $1 Coronas, Tuesdays are \""Wine Nights\"" where they serve $8 bottles of wine and champagne. Sundays, my favorite, are $1 you-call-its. The music is always great and the place is slammed most nights of the week. I've hosted lots of parties there-- and I always get a ridiculous amount of booze for the prices I pay (also get a private room)."
"2","They seem to have everything. Obscure films, B films, foreign films, nearly every weird movie I've found out on the internet, they have it. (One time there was some anime I wanted to see but they didn't have, but they explained that all the copies out there were pirated, and they'd be happy to add it to their collection if I could find a legitimate source for them.)\n\nSecondly... its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block.\n\nI kind of wish there was a way to return videos without wading into campus, though."
"2","It's like a portal into a chasm of anime, classics, world, documentary and varied films and cartoons. For Champaign, these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films.\n\nWhat prevents me from giving it 5 starts is their stupid rule that you must have a special card and meet special requirements to rent a film from them, including being over 18 (for *ANY* film)"
"1","Granted it's a dive campus bar but been frequenting them for half price burgers on Tuesday. Food was pretty good, loved the Mac and cheese as an upgrade. However today's visit had a special friend attend with us. Spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall. So much for the green health inspection sign on the door! Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon."
"1","I lived here my freshman year, and it definitely wasn't my favorite.  The rooms are big, so at first Bromley felt like a good deal.\n\nHowever, I quickly learned that the walls are thin (probably just two sheets of drywall), and you can hear *every* sound from the room next door.  Even on weeknights, students often yelled and ran through the halls at 3 or 4 am.  \n\nAs an engineer, I had 8:00 calculus most mornings.  So, I found it impossible to get much sleep, and I often found myself sleeping in friends' apartments, instead.\n\nIf your goal is to party constantly, this is your dorm.  If you're interested in getting some sleep, Bromley Hall is not your best bet."
"1","Meh. If I have to choose between Chipotle and Qdoba, I would choose the former. Both places have ample seating area but when it comes to the taste, Chipotle is far more superior. Do yourself a favor and get something better."
"1","Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)\n\nMaybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well."
"1","The food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous. I had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when I was leaving the restaurant!!! I had actually tipped him fairly well and I think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise! He did not seem to care that I was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and I have decided never to visit the place again."
"2","I used to think it was a One-star. At first, I loved the outdoor seating (still do), the decent beers and the average but very cheap food... I HATED that as a gay couple we felt really weird with all the drunk 30-40 somethings disapproving and some strange looks from staff... however things seem to have changed in that regard and we haven't had any adverse experiences in the last 6 months. Yeay."
"2","Coming from California, these are the cheapest drinks I've ever encountered! We called ahead of time to ask them to play the niners game, even though the bears / packers were the favored game of the day (and time). They had a TV set up all ready with the niners game when I got there.\n\nThere are peanut shells all over the ground, which I find a little tacky and dangerous. The Pizza was pretty decent - thin crust. We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.\n\nThere are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.\n\nThis place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign."
"2","Excellent service. They were very busy so the food was slow but they kept our mouths entertained with free bread and appetizers. Of course it is pricey but it is worth it. Food was excellent."
"1","The Good:\n-I liked the decor.  It was very pretty.\n-The \""Soup of the Day\"" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.  I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy.\n-Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list.\n-The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The waiter was not friendly.  He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever.\n-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).  You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa.  Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the \""Tapa of the Day,\"" because he didn't even know what it was.  ....What the f?  Why?!\n-I had the Korean Hot Pot.  I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't.  It was extremely sweet.  So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice.  It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice.  Blech!\n\nThe Ugly:\n-I got food poisoning.  Thank you, Korean Hot Pot.  My guts are still kvetching about you.\n\n...The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back.  If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score.  Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect."
"1","Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy.  That must be the problem with Radio Maria.  The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend.  Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad.  \n\nThe staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion.  (Really.)  I have no idea what's going on now.  Spanish-Korean?  Soul Food Middle Eastern Style?  Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.   The motto seems to be:  when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.\n\nThis could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated.  Stay away!"
"1","The sangria here is awful. I think it was a tequila sunrise. The food is greasy and not in a good way. The only thing good was the goat cheese. But it is goat cheese. How can you mess that up?"
"2","Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area."
"2","I have always enjoyed myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.\n\nA few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer \""The Wheel\"", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some \""rules\"", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night. Get a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold."
"2","I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign"
"2","love it.  i have been comming here with the rents since i was little, so its nostolgic for me.  i still get the same thing, a scoop of lemon on top of a scoop of chocolate in a waffle cone."
"1","So Domino's is Domino's, right?  You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza, breadsticks, chicken strips, pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for.  However, this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.\n\nMy friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's will give it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.\n\nPJ's.  Go for it."
"1","The staff was so RUDE! 1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime Fri night. We came back about 20 min later. Different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in, said we had to each pay $10. The place was ghetto and empty. We went back to Bar Smith (next door) who had much nicer staff, no cover, great drinks & drink prices, and awesome music. Sorry Sky Lounge, you suck."
"1","Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.\n\nI'm not sure if Palazzo is always open \""sometimes\"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. \n\nEvery time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. \n\nAlso? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks."
"2","We recently took our Mercedes to Virginia Auto Service for  a new set of tires. Since we purchased the vehicle there has been a vibration in the rear of the vehicle. We have taken it to several places, including the dealer, to have it repaired, to no avail. When Matt balanced the tires on his new machine, that simulated road force, the problem totally dissapeared. I guess it pays to go to the shops with the most high tech equipment. thanks guys!"
"2","Great food and generally good service. Lunch time can turn into a loong wait, but it's always worth it. Green Curry, mmmmmmmmmmm!"
"1","This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service."
"2","I recently frequented Wild Thaiger on a whim... based mostly on other Yelp reviews and convenience of location. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. \nAlthough the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun, a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff. \nThe menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super cool and much appreciated as it's more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in \""ethnic\"" cooking. \nThe vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items. \nI didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that. \nAll in all, a great experience."
"2","Wow what a great flavor for the dishes we had it was nearly impossible to stop eating even after our belly was completely full. The waiter was really great as well knew the food and had been there since the place opened. He gave is great recommendations all super delish. It was a really positive experience we will go back!"
"1","We spent 20 minutes here tonight waiting to be sat only to walk out...\n\nWe were told it would be about 15 mins. We waited patiently at the hostess stand, while a seemingly harried and unorganized staff ran around between the indoor and outdoor spaces. Various tables were empty and not being bussed, and another table was actually cleaned and ready. No clue what was going on...there was no one at the hostess stand, no apparent 'leader' to be seen. \n\nHoping it was just an off night...when I return to give them a second chance I still update my review"
"2","Fritter me timbers.... \n\nI mean, corn fritters. \n\nNot that this one little review makes any difference, but if you go, get the corn fritters. \n\nThis was my second time at Wild Thaiger and how that delicious app eluded me the first time, I will never know. \n\nNot the biggest fan of their Pad Thai, but that's okay. There are many other very delicious options... And corn fritters."
"2","A pool table. Reminiscent of a bye gone era. Best cut I've had in years. Thanks Omar"
"1","Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all. I just called and explained to the person at the front desk that I have been having some breast pain and didn't know if I should come in earlier than my Oct. 1st  Well Woman exam. Her response was, \""Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.\"" I said, \""well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.\"" Her reply, \""if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.\"" My reply, \""just for talking about it??\"" Her reply, \""yup, I don't know what to tell you. Just go to your primary care physician.\"" I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No response. Her overall tone was brash, rude, and short. Did I mention uncaring.\n\nUnbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients."
"1","Can I give this 0 Stars? I guess not. Bottom line, there are no vegetarian options, the produce is really bad, the line was ridiculously long because there was only one cashier in the entire store. I am so disappointed in this Safeway and will not return."
"1","I was a little nervous about shopping here after reading the reviews, but since it was closest to our hotel, we gave it a try.  It was fine. Nothing worse than you'd find in the SF Bay Area. Buck up, little campers. Quit being so stuck up."
"2","My review is for the bakery.  Did you know Safeway has a delicious carrot cake?  I ordered a half sheet for an office function.  I arrive at Safeway and the cake is not ready.  The lady who took my order failed to write down what kind of cake I wanted (minus the one-star).  The young woman who ended up helping me was very concerned and apologetic.  She was able to decorate a carrot cake for me farily quickly and did a wonderful job.  Very refreshing to see that some people still take pride in doing a good job."
"1","Oh for the love of God this place is boring. Pottery and pictures of pottery. \n\nI came here for some tour a few years ago. I was so bored I went outside and took a nap next to giant flower pot. Then I came back here last month for a charity event and also took a nap, this time in the bathroom.\n\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
"2","I stumbled across this museum while on the way to PAM. With a few hours to kill before our flights, my friend and I decided to stop here instead.\n\nIt was a great find and I learned so much. Unfortunately I hadn't learned very much about Native American culture or art in school, but I felt like my visit to the Heard made up for that a little. We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a broad overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names \""given\"" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, \""What are you called?\"" the people answered, \""Pima,\"" which means \""I don't know\""--as in, I don't know what you crazy people are asking me!\n\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you're ever in Phoenix."
"2","typically i'm not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits.  However, the Heard experience was beyond expectations.   The 7.50 student price was reasonable and we were instantly put on a walking tour around the museum. The guides were excellent and the museum is quite historic.   \n\nThe contemporary art pieces are not quite art museum worthy.  However the katina doll collection was awesome.  They have Barry Goldwater's personal collection of Katina dolls on display !    I highly suggest using the guided tours,  because some of the exhibits are difficult to process."
"2","Wife and I had the opportunity to attend a YELP event ! The show was called \""Circus Americana\"". Seating was great, don't believe there is a bad seat in the theater. Staff was very nice, bathrooms very clean. Parking is just across the street. Would like to come back and see other performances!"
"2","An Arizona elite institution.  High academic and artistic standards. Quite challenging for students. Teachers are unusually highly communicative."
"1","I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\n\nThe set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \n\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \n\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\n\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US."
"1","I really want to love this place, but I can't. The fries are great, the servers attractive and the food gets there fast, but the entrees aren't that great, bottle beer is $4 (that much for a miller lite at a sports bar? really?) and the servers, for whatever stupid, dumbass reason, refuse to split checks.\n\nThis does nothing but piss me off. I've never understood this practice. First of all, you're a sports bar. People genuinely come into sports bars in groups. We all ordered food, we all ordered drinks and it took nearly 25 minutes to figure out our goddamn bill at the end.\n\nAttention restaurant owners: MOST OF US DON'T CARRY CASH ANYMORE. Get with it and start splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups. There is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better tips."
"2","Watched Game 1 of the World Series here and had a great time, typical bar food, but excellent service and let us take our time, checked in with us regularly but not too pushy either."
"1","HUGE disappointment!!!! Stopped for a quick dinner before a show. Ordered 2 burgers medium. They came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry. The waitress took them back to the kitchen & returned with 2 more well done burgers! What the heck?! When we told her (& showed her), she apologized & took 20% off the bill. We didn't have time for round 3. They didn't even send a manager over. $30 for an inedible meal. We will not be back. I'd recommend trying somewhere else."
"1","First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. \n\nWe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. \nOur daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. \n\nThunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back."
"1","Another dismal review for this company. I called for a 6 AM pickup to the airport like I had several times previously. Dispatch informed someone would arrive. I waited until 6:10 AM and called again-dispatch then told me another 15 minutes until pickup! I stated that was not acceptable as I had a flight to catch. I ended up driving myself to the airport. Oh yeah, the driver called, as boarding for my plane started."
"2","I booked a stay at Hotel San Carlos for one night through Groupon for $76 after taxes. Most other hotels in the area go for $120-300, so finding this deal was awesome. My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night. Originally, we were going to book a night at Hotel Palomar but like I said, we weren't looking to spend a lot of money.\n\nI started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that I hadn't made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said. From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking. \n\nOnce we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great. \n\nHonestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom. I heard a couple of door slams but I think at any hotel its typical. All the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems. Wahhh, \""no room service\"", Wahhh \""the rooms are too small\"", Wahhh \""I couldn't control the room temperature\"", Wahhh \""there's something I have to lift my foot up 5 inches from the ground to get over in to the shower\"", Wahhh,  Wahhh,  Wahhh.  Get over it people. Take your spoiled attitudes over to the Hyatt."
"1","I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like \""your waiting for a table?\""the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review."
"2","What can I say about Comedor that hasn't already been said... The food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge. Back in the day before I started telecommuting, a margarita or beer paired with one of their daily specials have gotten me through more than one long assed afternoon at work (please don't tell my boss).\n\nThe wait staff is incredibly nice and watching newbies squint under the bright lights and bad south of the boarder art is always entertaining.\n\nIf you want to be a little bold, try one of their soups. They are scarrier than shit if you are a white girl that grew up on meat and potatoes, but they taste great (I just don't ask whats in it). LOL"
"2","yum! this place is yummy! it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take out-of-towners to. the doorman/security guard is so sweet and makes sure you don't get shot and that your car is there after your meal. the surrounding area is a bit tough, and i don't suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean. the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes.\n\ni made the mistake of ordering chicken once, and i was disappointed. not sure why ... maybe it is because they don't use all white meat chicken. or maybe it was an off day. or maybe i just don't like their chicken. i don't know. but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish. love the beans! they do 'em right. margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol, not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places. gotta love the free chips and salsa ... the salsa always tastes fresh, and they'll give you a super-spicy version if you ask. and they keep 'em coming, even after dinner if you want more.  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer ... it is huge, but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two. if you don't someone's going to wish they had gotten more."
"2","Met some friends here for a birthday dinner. Place was packed. I was drinking, but the rest of my group enjoyed the cocktails.\n\nThree of us split a mixed grill plate. Had enough for four as opposed to three. We opted for carne asada, carnitas, and chicken. Everything was prepared well and was quite tasty."
"1","Over Rated and to crowded.  Go to Mi Patio or La Canasta instead.  Or, go a little further north to Via Delosantos for even better food and drinks!"
"2","Last night was my first time in The Little Theater which is part of Phoenix Theater.  I didn't see it on the list so I'm reviewing it here. \n\nWe saw Reefer Madness the musical!  It was awesome!  I couldn't stop laughing.  The sound of the theater was excellent! \n\nIt was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable.\n\nThey had snacks out during intermission.  We bought two water bottles and I was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans.  They also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished. \n\nI will definitely see another play here!"
"2","I went to see In the Wake of Bounty (part of Fringe Fest 2011) and besides the show being exquisite, the venue was perfect.  Phoenix Little Theatre is basically attached to the Phoenix Art Museum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show. Take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture.  \n\n\nFree and plentiful parking!!!  The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.  Only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably.  Lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting."
"2","What I love about Yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the \""Nearby\"" search and prior reviewers telling you, \""it's okay, try it!\""\n\nThe grilled chicken burrito I had was delicious. What makes their burritos is the tortilla!  Their tortillas are the best I've had in a long time. Add the great salsa bar (small but fresh) and you have a great local neighborhood gem.\n\nI would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat, which I love but isn't for everyone.  The smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful.  It also had delicious Mexican rice & just enough melted cheese.\n\nTheir salsa was so good I finished every chip!  This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!  You order at the counter and listen for your number to be called.  The staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables.\n\nThanks Chico's I'll be back."
"1","Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.\n\nA co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.\n\nI got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road."
"2","This place is really great for teriyaki.  In fact it is really the only place worth going for teriyaki.  First of all - it is really very inexpensive (lunch for two under 20 - easily). Second of all - the service is great because it is family run - you see the same people there everytime.  The food is really good - and just hits the spot when you have a hankering for teriyaki.  My only complaint would be the hours- bums me out when I want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed."
"1","I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work."
"1","I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices."
"2","I have been here multiple times for all facets of dinning including lunch, dinner, drinks, late night bites and a corporate function and everytime i've liked it. It is one of my favorite places to go before a baseball or basketball game. They have a great selection of handcrafed beers both on tap and in bottles. There food is also really good for what i take as more of a bar enviornment. There burgers, sandwiches and pastas are all well executed and have a gourmet flair with resonable prices. The lobster bisque is fantastic, and so are the salads and appetizers. They have a great patio downstairs and a balcony where you can eat and drink outside upstairs too. Check this place out it is more than worth the visit, and they have good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials."
"1","I really wanted to like this place. I live nearby and I love the Downtown area. I want all the places here to be 4-5 star joints. But my partner and I showed up on a Sunday afternoon, with only a half-dozen people in the place and just as many waitresses, and they still took 45 minutes to deliver our food. We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.\n\nWe ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.\n\nThe pizza which I ordered because of the Kalamata Olives (their \""Mediteranean\"") was missing Kalamata Olives. That's right -- it's the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on. \n\nNever mind, after 45 minutes you'll eat anything. Beer was overpriced at $5 for a glass. We got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed. Won't be back."
"1","The lobster bisque is amazing I do agree, however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right.. the server took it upon himself to assume I wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time (weird). It takes forever to get another beer, heaven forbid your thirsty on a bad day.... lastly by the time my husband was able to grab the attention of Said server for katsup and mustard his burger it was cold and my salad had yet to arrive.. hence the extra time to sip on my late beer waiting for dinner.. I would say there are better more collected establishments in the area... wait as I hear the second ring from the kitchen for the salad that I can see from the window but can not have... :("
"1","I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\n\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. \n\nI'm not really high on the \""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\"" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\""\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it."
"1","I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves. \n\nThat said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul."
"1","I wont be back here again,  Ever.    Can one give less that 1 star? \n\nIt is a bummer as I used to frequent this place as it is conveniently located for me.  Pamela the bartender is a sweetheart and works hard to recognize people by name.   Personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around.   If you think I am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures.   That fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust.  Carpets are dingy and smells like old beer.  This place rocks as a nightclub on weekends I dont think that cleanliness is the priority......anyhow....I spent a lot of money there over the years, mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends.  Never more..... not because of the issues outlined above, but it is beacuse how I was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago.   Pamela was not working that day (sadly) and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money.  He had an issue, and apparently I was the target and cause of his rantings.   He was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as I mentioned I worked downtown.   His rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for.   I drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again.  No wonder they are lacking for customers.    There are more and more restaurants downtown.  Time to step it up or get out of the way Matador!"
"2","Dined with a good friend of mine while in town, so the slow(ish) service was no bother. Actually, we had good service. They were on top of my need for water with lots of ice.\n\nLisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good. The portion was large and she took about half home.\n\nI got the chimichanga. It was a delight. The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland. Usually my rice goes uneaten, but this rice was about the best Mexican rice I've ever had. The beans were as I like them; full of cheese. \n\nThey have 2 sauces that come with the chips, one a chipotle, which I'm not a fan of, the other a spicy red which I slathered on top of my food.\n\nI'm sort of shocked at the low stars this place has gotten. My experience was grand and that's no bull! (Matador; bull; get it?)"
"1","Tried this place for lunch, had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend Matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime."
"1","Service was not good, they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale."
"1","This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had, and I've had Verizon, T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.\n\nI would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world, only then is it worth it)."
"1","My friend and I stopped here for a light dinner before going to a movie at the AMC theater in the same plaza. Not sure why we picked this place. I think we just both realized we were kinda hungry after we'd already parked and walked in. \n\nMi Amigo's was never really on my radar as a place to try. I'm more a fan of the hole-in-the-wall \""real\"" mexican food place. This place kinda felt like a mexican-themed, or mexican-inspired restaurant but it lacked something... almost felt like a food court with table service. \n\nThe food was fine. It wasn't bad. The service was fine. \n\nMy friend had the shrimp and garlic platter, and enjoyed it. I had a small tortilla soup. We probably over-did it with the chips and salsa. And even those were just fine. I would have liked for someone to just leave a pitcher of water (no ice) on the table because it felt like an eternity between refills and each refill succeeded in mostly adding more ice to my glass. No bueno.\n\nNo dessert, no drinks. Wasn't really feelin' it.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm jumping at the chance to eat here again. It's serviceable. If I find myself at the AZ Center and other people want to eat here, I will do my best to make suggestions to go elsewhere, but I won't encourage it. But I won't fight it if the majority rules."
"1","This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered:\nCombo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada \nGreen chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross.\nTaco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter.\nThe beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans.\nThis place sux!\nBeer is good."
"1","Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great. \n\nThe real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..\n\nOverall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food."
"1","Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the \""Canyon Caf\u00e9\"" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, \""Mi Amigo's \"" .  I reviewed the Canyon Caf\u00e9's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try \""Mi Amigo's\"" . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I liked about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!"
"1","If you're on a budget this place is probably 4 star however it's not for me. It's very bland- not something I'd expect from a Mexican restaurant."
"1","Went here just before a movie. The service was fast but that's it. I ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered nachos. The food was not good. I and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after."
"1","My boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning!  I was extremely disappointed, because the location is near our condo and the staff was so friendly!  I think we are going to the emergency room!"
"1","Not my first choice for Mexican food by far but when I have mo choice so be it. The staff is ehh and not that friendly or fast. The only thing I will eat here is the rolled tacos, everything else I've had is not up to my Mexican food standards by a long shot."
"1","This Hooters is near my house so it's always convienient to come here, but the service and the food is hit or miss. \nI frequent a lot and really enjoy their wings. The server was MIA all night, twice I had ordered wings one flavor-honey thai and i got the new flavor they have- chipotle honey both times. Was not satisfied at all. Server took my drink for refill and never came back after 20 minutes I asked for the check, she sure was quick to come get that. \nThe manager there is rude and unattentive, she accused my friend of \""making a coupon\"" that was on their website and did not want to accept it because she said she didn't know where the coupon came from even though we pulled up the website and showed her the coupon. \n The one that I really enjoy is the one on Alma School, it is a bit of a drive but the food and service is always spot on!"
"1","I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find."
"1","Why would anyone pay money for food like this?"
"1","This should have been a better experience... \n\nI'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\n\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \""lunch menu\"" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \""Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\"".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \n\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \""that doesn't apply\"" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars."
"2","Ok this place was soo fantastic. I ordered the appetizer Sicilian garlic cheese bread. It had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic. The bread wasn't hard either just right. For my main entree I went with chicken broccoli fettuccine Alfredo. I definitely made the right choice. It tasted delicious! To top it off they include dessert with dinner. :)"
"1","My family of 5 went for dinner on a Saturday night. We had a reservation for 6:30 granted we went early to see if we could be seated earlier but no luck needless to say we did not get seated till almost 7. The hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved. My kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs. Food did not come out hot at all. The food was also average nothing special about it. I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back."
"1","Used a Groupon special for the Murder Mystery evening with tickets to the show and dinner. The Murder Mystery show was in a room about 20 x 30 feet with 50 people crowded into this space. The volume of the music and announcements were so loud, we couldn't even talk to half the people at out table! They took our drink order and we didn't see it until half an hour later. The food was HORRIBLE! How can you ruin a spaghetti dinner??First of all, it was cold! Cold spaghetti !! Hardly any sauce! The house salad was taken out of a plastic bag and dumped into a bowl....at an Italian place, they served the salad with only ranch dressing ..... Not even Italian! And no choices offered.  Our party of four will NOT go back. At least 10 others felt the same way."
"1","Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about."
"1","I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.\n\nI had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless. \n\nFor the price I would expect better food... much better food. \n\nHonestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks."
"1","I have to say, I was extremely disappointed when stopping in for lunch today.  My husband raved about Tom's lunch he had several months ago.  He said they had \""killer\"" potato salad and a chili-mac-and-cheese you'd never find anywhere.\n\nThe 2 of us ordered; Prime Rib French Dip, Cuban Pork Sandwich and a BLT.\n\nThe French Dip was the worst of the 3.  Dry, very over cooked - crispy meat - nothing that we expected, a huge disappointment.  The Cuban Pork was mediocre at best.  The BLT - only okay at best.  I have to say the sides were a different story - the Cole Slaw is the best you may ever eat.  Fries - same, excellent.\n\nThe staff was very attentive, hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly.\n\nI don't know what Tom's looked like prior to the remodel - I sure wish I would have made it to lunch before the remodel - we certainly will not go back.  $45.00 for 3 lunches and one soda - not worth it."
"2","Stumbled on this place while sight seeing on a long lay over in Phoenix. The food was moderately priced and service was quick. The waiter was pleasant. For being downtown the place was very quiet. In fact, the whole of downtown was quiet."
"2","This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town. \n\nI don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+"
"1","I had really high hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... However I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she finally came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi. After telling her I wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash I went inside and sat around for a few hours. When it was finally done, I got what I expected, a nice, shiny, clean car.. with a soaking wet interior. Granted, I've never had an interior detail before, but I didn't expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that. They actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me, but since I had to stop at some place afterwards I accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom. I was told to keep the windows cracked an inch or 2, and did the whole weekend, however now my car kinda stinks and I'm going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that. I'm not happy, and I'm not going back either. I'm giving them 2 stars because they did what I asked them to do: they cleaned my car.\n\nP.S. I work at an insurance company. I spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat."
"1","This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff"
"2","This place is great, only problem I had was deciding what yo eat.  You walk in and the smell of great food over comes you.  Staff was very helpful and the food was very good and lots to choose from, everyone in our party was please with their lunch."
"1","I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place."
"1","Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE. \n\nI'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler."
"1","Long lines before/after sporting events. Limited beer selection. Mediocre food. I wasn't impressed. I can't tell you how many times I thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area, only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer. Not worth the wait."
"1","I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice.\n\nThe hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns.\n\nBoth times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), \""stop being mean to the customers\"" and \""be nice!\"""
"2","I enjoyed the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it."
"2","One of my favorite veggie sandwiches ever!  The sandwich is called \""Where's the Beef?\"" and any menu planner / company owner with a sense of humor is A-OK in my book!  Comes with tomatoes, celery, sprouts, lettuce, avocados, cucumbers, jicama, and pinenuts.  I recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese.\n\nGreat place for a downtown lunch.  There are lots of places that do sadwiches.  I go to Jacquees for good Boar's Head meat, I go to Sticklers for the delicious fresh bread, and I go to D&D for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu.  Soups change daily, as does a flavored tea, staff is hit or miss on friendliness.\n\nToday I got to try the Buffalo Chicken Soup and was impressed! Then again, how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy, spicy buffalo flavor? The good news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. The bad news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. Calorie counters - stay away from this soup!\n\nD&D can get very busy around noon, along with many of the downtown places.  I suggest calling in your order if you don't want to wait -OR- you can even use their website to order online.  Cool!!"
"1","Been trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery. I get voice mail and nothing else."
"2","I went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak. I had it then with just the meat and cheese. Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, \""With onions and mushrooms?\"" Okay, yeah. \""Sweet or spicy peppers?\"" Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich. \n\nThis place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans. Yet I can see myself going here on a regular basis. So, the next time you're having one of those moments, like Ameerah A, opt for the cheese steak. Just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up."
"2","Went in today no appointment, and Jimmychoo was able to do my back-fill in under 40 minutes because I was in a hurry.  They look fantastic!! Will definatly be going back!"
"1","This is the first time Yelp reviews have let me down. I tried this new location due to the reviews and being 5 mins from my job. I opted for a manicure and shellac. Three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel. I called the salon and they asked I return and have the shellac redone. I did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling. This has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels. This was a waste of money and especially time!!"
"2","Not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews! I used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch AT LEAST 2 times a week. I still make it down there occasionally since i no longer work in phoenix. The owner and his wife are always so sweet and chatty, they remind me so much of my grandparents. I compare all schlotzky's to this one, and most fail in comparison.  My favorite sandwich to this day is the Albuquerque Turkey with lots of their hot sauce... now my mouth is watering... As far as \""poor choice of sides\"" go, good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries! I prefer chips with my sandwich anyways... anyhoo.. if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line, but it goes quick! :)"
"2","I cant believe I have been here for going on seven years and just tried this restaurant.  The sauce is AMAZING and the meat is tender and delicious.  The atmosphere isnt the greatest, even for a BBQ joint, but the food was great."
"1","I'm glad I had a Deal Chicken deal because the food was just ehhh. \n\nWith my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns. \n\nThe ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course). \n\nCollared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either. \n\nService was friendly & efficient. \n\nWarning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in. There were several on the day I was in... ick!"
"1","Service: I asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four. He gave his recommendation and I went with it. Got the meal home and we only have 1 mac and cheese, 1 potato salad 5 rolls. Now, this wasn't some big Styrofoam container. It was just enough for one person. The clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed. \n\nFood: It was ok. Not great, just okay. There wasn't anything that screamed \""Have seconds!\"" The sauce is decent. Nothing spectacular. \n\nOverall, it was a 2 because nothing blew me away. I just made some ribs tonight on the grill and I thought they were better than Honey's. \nIf you're craving bbq, then this will get you out of a pinch. But if you want the \""Slap yo momma\"" type grub, then make an about face."
"1","The lady at the register mean... The wait was like they left to a different restaraunt to get out food..."
"1","Went there with my girlfriend for what I thought would be good bbq. She ordered the half chicken and I got a pulled pork sandwich.  Not only did her chicken come out pink and bleeding once but it happened twice. When I told them the first time the cashier said, \""we usually have good food.\"" So it's okay to serve bad food too? He asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same,  still pink and bleeding. All he said was oh okay and walked away. I didn't even eat my sandwich because if they couldn't cook chicken right why should I trust them to cook the pork correctly? When I went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared.  Never would I think about going back and spend my money there again."
"1","have not been there in a long time...the guy taking the order was in some other world.\nthe amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich has been reduced to almost half.\nthe drinks are watered down. and the prices are up. Me thinks I wont be back there."
"1","First time here.  I'll give credit where it's due, they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous. \n\nI had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork.  While eating my sandwiches I had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq.  Boiled meat covered in BBQ sauce is NOT BBQ.  \nI grew up in the South, I've been to Memphis in May a couple of times, so my standards for BBQ are admittedly higher than average, but this was not even close to real BBQ.\n\nWas it decent food.  Sure.  Decent, at best.  Was it the reason I got an upset stomach a couple hours later, possibly.   I don't care about the old decor, dirty looking bathrooms or anything else, if the food was good I would go back.  It wasn't."
"1","As you might be able to tell from my schizophrenicly changing stars for this place, my experiences have varied.  Some things that do not ever change, with my latest experience in parentheses:\n-They seem to carry only the tastiest wines.  (Pascual Toso Reserve Malbec '08)\n-Their cheeses are also amazingly amazing.  (American Plate w/ Buzzed from Utah and a perfectly aged Gouda)\n-Their food is great.  (Lasagna)\n\nHowever,\n-The kitchen ran out of pizza, mac&cheese (which is what i wanted), and lasagna (luckily i made the cut).  That's easily half their menu!  We subsequently had to change our orders twice as the bad news kept rolling in.  By the end of the night our poor server was like the Angel of Death since each time I saw him I got nervous that he was going to come tell me that whatever it was I had ordered was yet again 86ed.\n-Then the food that we WERE able to order took over 45 minutes to show up.\n-Then the Reverse Happy Hour cocktails were inconsistent (different colored Pomegranate Margaritas, one Pineapple Cosmo that tasted great, but a 2nd that had a coffee flavor - which they gladly replaced for a good tasting one).\n\nOverall I ended up paying WAY too much for a lackluster experience.  What really peeved me off was that I had recommended this place to our party of 14, with the hope that I could show them how awesome places in CenPho are, since they're all suburbanites.\n\nSo thank you Cheuvront, for making me look like a fool and giving my friends one more reason to stay in the 'burbs  :("
"2","Decided to take a short trip downtown to try the Central Coast Wine Tasting event held here last week.  We had a blast!  While the rep that hosted the wine tasting made the wine tasting a fun and informative event, we really enjoyed the atmosphere and FOOD! \n\nThe tapas plate that came with the wine tasting was fabulous, blue cheese and bacon stuffed dates, a super tasty California cheese (bought some to take home) and a tiny, but very yummy shrimp salad. That only made us want to try more!  \n\nJeannie loves scallops, so naturally she ordered the Scallop Martini.  I know deep down she did not want to share, but she graciously fed me one of those monsters.  She said they are the best she has ever had and I have a hard time arguing with her.  Three big, tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops resting in a Martini glass.  The accompanying sauce was absolutely delicious.  We also ordered a single cheese plate with a cheese from Spain, Mahon (I think).  Loved that one too, so of course we bought some to enjoy later. \n\nWon't wait for a wine tasting to make our return...."
"1","Unfortunately, they are out of business.  Looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago.  I have eaten there twice and it was very good. Don;t know why they closed but they had a Thank You banner posted for their customers.  \nToo bad."
"2","Alice Cooperstown is, as my husband said, \""like a Hard Rock that's not stupid.\""  The concept is a bizarre combo of Alice Cooper and a sports bar - and it works.  \n\nWe stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game, and they didn't look very thrilling.  The menu at Cooperstown is pretty extensive - lots of options.  \n\nThe service was very quick and efficient.  I see no reason to go anywhere else before a D-Backs game."
"2","Walked over before a dbacks game. Loved the beer garden, nice draft selection and good tunes. It will likely become tradition before future games."
"2","Enjoyed it through and through. Had the big unit hot dog. It was actually delicious. Will go back whenever im in Arizona. Oh! and the waitress was very nice."
"2","Lets just say this place is awesome! My sister in law ordered that huge ol' hot dog and shared it with 3 different people. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size. I wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it!  It is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up I would definitely steer clear of this place!!! But fun place to just enjoy a good lunch/drink or two!"
"1","I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \""You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\"".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \""I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\""....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \""No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\"".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%"
"2","We took our in-laws here while they were visiting from out of state. This was on their to do list of local experiences. It was also my first time here since moving to the valley. Nobody was disappointed.\n   We came for lunch on a Thursday around noon. We were able to get metered parking right in front of the place. There is a lot in back that charges $5.00 as well.They were about 30% full. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately. They brought a highchair for the baby too.\n   I loved the d\u00e9cor. Classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme. Many of Alice Cooper's own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars. There were several large screen TVs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well. The waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme.\n   The menu feature's items with a celebrity theme. I ordered the \""Adam Richman's bases loaded big unit\"" and a local micro brew. The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. This was a 1 lb., 22\"" loaded hotdog with a good order of fries. The hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut, \""nightmare\"" chili, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese. It was more than I could hope to eat, but I did do serious damage. After I got a to go box, we browsed the gift shop. Everything Alice was available.\n  This place isn't for everybody who is not into the genre. We did enjoy it and will return on special occasions. If you go make it a week day for lunch. It's probably when you'll get best for service. They are located near Chase Field, so they are probably packed on game day. The menu is a little pricy, but worth the experience."
"2","Great place, good food"
"1","Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally.  Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love BBQ.  No such luck.  Nothing seemed like real BBq  just over cooked and tasteless.  Very Chain resturant-y,  Cool memorabilia abut that's about it.  They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal.  I don't reccommend."
"2","Cooperstown Sports Grill Does NOT disappoint! \n\nCooperstown offers an incredible selection of beers, good food and excellent service.  The prices are reasonable, and the servers are outstanding.  \n\nCooperstown Sports Grill is big, filled with large screens televisions. The walls are covered in vintage guitars signed by every rock star and rare sports collectibles signed by past & present icons.\n\n The food entrees have celebrity names, like the Bill O'reilly BBQ sandwiches, Kurt Warner corned beef,  AZ Cardinals Country BBQ chicken salad, or my favorite the \""Jeff\""  grilled chicken salad.  I would put the grilled chicken salad up against anybody (including Durant's or even Arrogant Butcher).\n\nSo if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix give Cooperstown Sports Grill a try, it does not disappoint"
"2","Watched a Suns game here recently and had a blast.  The arena is in the heart of Downtown Phoenix and is near bars and restaurants.  It's really easy to have a pre and post-game party.  We walked to Lucky Strikes after the game and had a few drinks and shot some pool.\n\nOverall, it's a good time in this arena.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
"2","Harsh to say, but I hate arenas. The only time I go is to see s concert, show or special event as I'm not an arena-type sports fan. Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.\n\nSince we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.  This was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour, my lower back was killing me (and I still feel it this morning!).  But . . . the seats were wonderful for viewing the show.  Couldn't have been better.  \n\nSound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations. \n\nI have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the \""nightmare\"" worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!  Bravo!"
"2","I have seen quite a few games & concerts at US Airways Center, and now having the light rail, it makes getting into and out of downtown Phoenix so much easier! Plus with a game ticket you can ride for free, up to 4 hours before to 4 hours after the event for FREE!!! And the train stops are walking distance from the arena.  Never a bad time at US Airways Center"
"2","Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 brews. I used to watch this arena on TV for years when the Suns were good and I was living elsewhere. It seems less orange in person, maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too. If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are free and obviously on the Sunday I went no charge. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, good entertainment also at least on this day. It was the gorilla's birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the 8 year-old girl who sang the anthem was top notch."
"2","I went to this venue for the Carnivore's tour last month and was really pleased with my experience again. This time when I went, we were in a slightly different section and the lighting was WAY better. The line of sight to the show was great, and although I'd prefer to be closer to the stage, it was a great experience. Awesome show, great accommodations."
"1","WORST NIGHTS SLEEP I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only was the mattress ridiculous stiff to where I ended up laying on the bed pillows and only got a couple hours of sleep.  When I went down to the front desk at 6am to request a room change due to the mattress (and I should really say I hobbled down due to being stiff & sore) the front desk lady was unsympathetic and said that all the mattress's in the hotel are the same.  She gave me no options and asked if I wanted to check out and of course offered no refund or discount.  Even going back up to my room to pack I encountered other guests who were complaining about the stiffness in their back from the mattress.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!  The breakfast, location, pool, and fitness room nowhere near out way the amount of pain you will be in all day because of one nights stay.  I wish I could give them a zero on Yelp but alas I am forced to give them 1 star which they are undeserving of."
"2","Going in - you know your going to get typical TGIF food.  But the view is great!  If you're a sports junky you need to eat here once.  We took my grandfather, a sports nut, for lunch (hopped off the light rail) and he loved it.  As we ate lunch on the \""patio\"" we watched as the landscapers groomed the field.  The top was open, the sun was shining, a breeze was blowing...ahhh..  The service was perfect.  Our server was funny - took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon (or before) we needed it."
"1","I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that \""EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round\""... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy."
"1","My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong. \n\nThe restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT! \n\nI had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing \""let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away.\"" After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order! \n\nOur waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit \""Front Row.\"" \n\nI'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ..."
"2","I live across the street and visit often. Could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of Chase Field! The customer service has always been great. Often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while I wait. Just the traditional Fridays menu but the location makes it worth going. Definite place to check out when you are downtown. Doesn't have to be a game day."
"2","A great little place to see shows, very small, very intimate, a great setting for seeing a band. If a band you want to see is playing here, be sure to go, it doesn't get anymore up close and personal than this.\nThere is no seating or alcohol, so if you don't mind standing and being sober, it is well worth it.\nThe art here is some of First Friday's best, as far as I am concerned, leagues above all the other galleries. Be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then."
"1","This place could be really great, but unfortunately as of now it sucks.\n\nFirst of all, I've never been to a concert venue like this with no bar...  Call me an alcoholic, but I like my beer in hand when I'm nodding my head to some obscure hipster band I've never heard of.\n\nThe outside is kind of cool- but the inside is awful!  The walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms.  There were no decorations or paintings on the wall when I went even though I thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery.  Maybe I went on a night that they were between showings.  The space is small, but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work.  Unforch, it didn't.  The sound system seemed cheap also.\n\nThis place could be great if they just put in a bar, and hired a decorator."
"2","Hm, didn't realize Bar Bianco had their own review page.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix#hrid:PvdncjR2V1mDcLIPIGJ73Q\n\nIn short, awesome rustic feeling re-purposed house, smoking hot bartender woman, relaxed and comfy country style patio, and delicious Four Peaks on tap."
"2","Really good service.  James at the bar made some really good recommendations. The place is right next to Pizzeria Bianco.  So while you wait for a table there, come here for a drink and kick it.\n\nThey also have a great wine menu, if you're into that.  I guess on Fridays they have a live band playing inside."
"2","Stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in.  Since then we haven't stopped eating at Athenian Express.   A good five miles out of the way.    What attracted us?  Great food, great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly.  Seriously one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met.   I started out with the Turkey Pita.  Delicious. Yet she urged me to be more creative.   Love it all now including the staff.   There isn't a day where it isn't hussle and bussle in the place,  yet the service is fast and always accurate.  Seriously, I eat it almost every day."
"2","Summer time is supposed to be \""healthy time\"", so I am trying to watch what I eat. Now, I will always be a big guy (not \""two fat twins on their matching motorcycles\"" big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one \""What are you doing for lunch\"" from a buddy and I was out of there.\n\nAthenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.\n\nFirst issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!\n\nOutside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.\n\nMy coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.\n\nAll in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the \""exciting\"" 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe)."
"2","Locally owned, authentic, good prices, big servings. Gyro meat is moist and full of flavor! Veggies are always fresh. Feta is the best! Go to in the Roosevelt Row neighborhood."
"2","You'll notice a huge age discrepency, really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages.  So I give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall.\n\nI love science museums, making a point to attend in any big city I travel to.  The exhibits seem lacking (even in simple terms) of the magic behind the science... hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated."
"2","Just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and I want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet.  I have been to the body exhibit, the titanic exhibit and others there.  Of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids, they blow stuff up at the lab, they have tons of cool little sections with things to do.  It is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the Van Gogh exhibit coming next.  Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real \""pieces of 8\"" they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.  This is not just a kid exhibit and in fact I spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it."
"2","Arizona Science Center brings science and entertainment to the young and fresh minds of the community. The staff are always friendly! The weekend manager Manny is very knowledge and able about the ASC and all the exhibits. He was very helpful.\n\nI look forward to visiting again. The weekends are always packed, if you can make it during the weekday you will bypass the mass of patrons.  \n\nR\\_"
"2","We LOVE the AZ Science Center so much that we recently became members and plan to go often. We love the exhibits and the fact that they change out the special exhibits often. I do recommend packing a lunch as the cafe is a bit pricey, but the food is good."
"2","love this place, in every way!"
"1","Attended the Ancient Ales, Modern Science event with several others and was very disappointed. \nThe Ancient Ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only 1 or 2 of the breweries made it the whole 4 hours. We spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didn't get a chance to see much of the Science Center, thankfully I was with good company."
"2","I love this place and my kids love this place.  We have been members for years.  The best part is this membership gets us into other museums throughout the US for free or for a big discount."
"2","Good hospital. Trauma teams are excellent. There's a reason they filmed a Trauma:Life in the E.R. here. All the nurses on pretty much all the floors are all good. Quite a few gorgeous ones too. Just saying."
"2","I completely agree with Chris S. Happy pills. Seriously. EVERYONE at this hospital is SO NICE!!! The nurses, the doctors, all of the staff....day and night. My friend is being treated here and has been addmited for various days now, and everyone agrees this hospital has really made this whole situation so much more bearable and less stressful, considering. \n\nWhen you or a friend is going through illness or trauma, the last thing you want to deal with is rude and uncaring nurses and doctors. You will NOT experience that here....they are WONDERFUL.\n\nThe hospital itself is very nice, it feels modern and clean. There is even a nice \""healing garden\"" you or patients can relax and get a little fresh air in. The food isn't that bad considering this is a hospital...I had a nice salad and sweet potato fries one day! Prices are like an airport.....expensive. But at least it's not typical cafeteria food.\n\nThank you Good Sam for taking such good care of my friend!"
"2","Colin M. did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business, so check out his review.  I can only second what he said.  \n\nThis is a real camera shop, stocked to the gills with lots of top-of-the-line stuff.  It would be easy to be intimidated but don't let that keep you from going into this fine establishment.\n\nI have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendly.\n\nYou can find better prices on the internet, but no instant gratification on the internet.  And who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one?  Who will repair or clean your camera for you?  No, we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more, it's worth it."
"2","Rosita's Place Rocks! It has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food. The green & red sauce are both pretty hot and spicy Chips are fresh and fried on premises. All entrees are quite big and enough to feed two. It draws interesting crowd. I was there with some folks from work after a conference and so were in suits. There were some families, retired folks, emo-kids and bubbas. Try the combination burro with enchilada sauce. Can't go wrong with that. Beer and tequila is reasonably price."
"2","What a find!\nI found this place thank to my trusty Yelp app. I wanted some good, spicy Mexican food and Rosita's Place seemed to fit the bill.\nIn all honesty I was planning to go to Los Dos Molinos, but they are closed on Sundays...\n\nYou park behind the restaurant and walk around the front, dodging a few cars along the way.\nWalking in, I loved the atmosphere. It was bustling and full of life, but not overwhelmingly busy. We were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond...hmmm.\nThe service was prompt, the chips and salsa came right out. The salsa...oh the salsa, it is delish, full of flavor and lots of heat, but in a good way.\nI ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green. My companion ordered the green chili tamale plate (out of this world good).\nThey arrived glowing hot! The plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes, (which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer). \nOnce the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing!!!\nThe flavors were spot on, the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great. The refried beans here are like crack. I was so full but could not stop eating them. Yum!\n\nI'm pretty sure I have found my go-to Mexican spot in Phoenix."
"2","Good solid mexican food.  Big portions and small prices.  If you order a burrito or chimi get it wet, I made that mistake only once!"
"2","The hours are wrong for Sunday. Beware. The food is wonderful but yelp is posting the wrong hours on Sundays. I'm here at 7pm and this amazing restaurant is closed.\nI am sad"
"1","I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill."
"1","Being from Southern California, the \""scene\"" is so much fun. There are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time. That brings us to the Phoenix scene and The Cash.Oh wait, there is no scene for the ladies. Not going to bash them to hard, because it's the only consistent place that we have. Yes it caters to the Country music crowd, but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend evenings.The mixed drinks could be better, but the prices are reasonable."
"1","I walk on a Sat morning at 11am for a retouch on my ombre hair. I had it blonde already and the lady first told me to wait I did. She then came back got me started put foils on which I think she wasn't going to do bec my hair was already light. I show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes. Long story short after3hrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me there(for another 30-45mins). I got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and I also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with 2 other ladies. My hair was horrible YELLOW AND FRY so burn, uneven tones of yellow/orange/black and red when all I wanted was a caramel ombre. I was so mad but I still just pay her after 6+hrs all I wanted was to go home so I had no energy for arguing. I did told her I didn't like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out. I do not recomment Rachel or the location on 16th st at all. I when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so I when to the other location on 15th ave and Camelback Lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize, did a color correction. She fix my hair it look exactly how I wanted. She was really nice/caring and ask what I wanted and not wanted. She was also super fast and did my hair in about 2hrs or less. I really recomment Lorraine at the Camelback location. She also didn't charge me for the correction she just apologize for the incovenience and gave me a treatment to fix my brittle dry hair."
"2","La Tolteca is the most authentic mexican food. It is so good and a great place to eat if you are down town. Check out the grocery section, they have freshly made tortillas to take home. Delicious!"
"2","A Phoenix native told me I had to try the mexican food while I was in town, so I stopped by La Tolteca and I was happy I did.  I tired out a torta and a couple of sopas.  The al pastor sopa was right on as was the the carne asada.  My milanesa torta was a bit chewy but otherwise prepared with great fresh veggies.  Hit up the salsa bar for some extra flavor!  Enjoy!"
"2","We had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone I saw this one.  On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \""regular\"" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.\n\nI hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas)."
"1","This has to be the most ghetto and disrespectful dive I've ever been to. I usually don't play the race card, but unless you are a Spanish speaking Latino you will not be treated well by the staff.\n\nAs soon as I walked up to the counter, a pregnant cashier rolled her eyes and asked dully what I wanted. I couldn't pronounce the name of the combo I wanted but I blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture. She looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something. The only words I caught were \""token gringo customer.\""\n\nThey shared a giggle.  They were speaking in that half-assed Spanish that has a little English mixed in. Suffice it to say I was offended and promptly cancelled the order. I have not returned since then"
"2","La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. \n\nGet the chilaquiles! Get them. \n\nWe also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. \n\nI'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation."
"1","Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge."
"1","Mu Shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout. Sundays and Asian food, I know. I'm Asian.\n\nCurrently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade, the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving.\n\nDon't get chicken."
"1","So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the \nChinese District . . . it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food.\n\n I was soooooo disappointed.\n\nThe egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm.  A minute after my soup\nwas served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.  No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots.  The minimal sauce was very bland.  The rice was not fresh."
"1","What's your opinion of an MD who wears a three piece suit?  When I see a doctor wearing a three piece suit, the first thing that comes to my mind is, why is he wearing a suit?  Did he wear a suit to class in med school?  Did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.\n\nDr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  \nDr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.   I ended up  going with  Dr. Mark Lyons, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic."
"2","If you are at all bashful or have issues around nudity, you might want to stop reading now.  This place will not be for you.... but for the free spirited, the Alwun House is the place to be this month for their Erotic Art Festival.\n\nThe exhibit kicks off with their outrageous sneak preview party tonight, (Feb. 8th) at 7pm.  Don't expect to see stuffy art aficionados milling about with glasses of champagne. Do expect to see transvestites on 8 inch platform shoes dancing and laughing with the  glitter dusted, the body painted, the latex clad, and the goths. They create a club atmosphere in their back yard with a floor show of comics, cross dressers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists.  You can't immerse yourself in the circus atmosphere and not walk away smiling."
"2","So I was visiting Arizona for spring training baseball and pining for a decent meal when we stumbled across Welcome Diner.  This place friggin' rules.  All of the food that our party tried--duck burger, breakfast biscuit, creole breakfast--was off the chain.  And they service beer, which is perfect for a Sunday brunch.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the service excellent.  They take pride in their craft, and you can see why when you taste the food.  If you're looking for a place to get some soul-nourishing food with a soulful flare, this is the place for you."
"2","Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.  As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once said \""fully booked\"" when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.\n\nIf you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%."
"1","This might be a good way to kill time if you're near the airport, the food really wasn't that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldn't really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I could've gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else."
"2","For this pinche Gringo, this place rocks. \nIt's a very festive place to both shop and dine. Their food offerings through their \""Cafe\"" or whatever they call it is endless. \nIt's a great spot to grab a cheap lunch. They are usually busy, so allow yourself 10-15 minutes between ordering and actually eating. \nTheir Agua Frescos are delicious. I recommend the Melon. It's sweetened Cantaloupe puree, served on ice. There are little melon chunkies, small enough to slurp through a straw. \nOf all the food I've had there, it was good. Carnitas, carne asada gorditas, etc. \nSo if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to Ranch Market...."
"1","I have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years. Here is my review.\nThe foods are not the same as they used to be. We bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week, but they started growing mold about three days after.. never used to be this way. \nThe service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no apology!  It used to be so different here."
"1","I have to agree with the other two star rating.This place used to be top notch.Over the last 7 years they have gone way down. In quality service and in how the food is presented. I wonder if they are having trouble with thier managers. hope that upper management will look into this. I would like to come back and see an emprovement."
"1","This company is HORRIBLE!! They don't know the meaning of customer service. If you are unlucky enough to have them assigned to you from Lowes or Home Depot request another service provider. The scheduler Julie is I must say the rudest customer service person I have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time. They came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer. Said nothing was wrong. After they tech left I found a scratch on my washing machine glass top. This company is full of crack pots who need a reality check. Nice job Julie!"
"2","This is our neighborhood spot for ceviche... though if you want oysters go to the spot at McDowell and 18th St... no idea what the name is."
"1","Maybe the current economy has forced Tacos de Juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food, because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had. We live mere blocks from here, so we felt it was about time we tried it. \n\nThe chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had, as was the relleno batter. \n\nI ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.\n\nWe've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return."
"2","A little house filled with delicious food, quaint seating and a cute patio. This pretty much sums of Coronado Cafe. I have been wanting to visit Coronado Cafe for quite awhile now and finally today was the day! This little house also reminds me of a little elf's cottage but in a really cute way. \n\nI like the food and atmosphere here. I tried the veggie wrap with chicken and it had a very delicious vinegar added to it. It was the perfect tough. I really wanted to try the goat cheese salad, but there is always next time!"
"2","The service was great. Love the martini. The women were so helpful. Cite place!"
"1","I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).\n\nI walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more \""attention grabbing\"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).\n\nI don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no."

"1","It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.  \nI'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps."
"1","I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand."
"1","At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche."
"2","Magnifico!  Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was very flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!"
"1","I ate here 2 years ago and had one of the best meals. Not sure what changed, oh wait, it's the quality of the fish. I got the caldo de pescados. The sea bass was gross. So then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again, the fish was no bueno. I'm real sorry. I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here and had 2 inedible entrees. \n\nCrab tostada, guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating 2 different dinners. The staff was super nice about it and the owner didn't charge me. I wanted to pay but he refused. So nice but I felt terrible. Bad dream."
"2","The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!"
"2","When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back. \n\nProbably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies. \n\nIf you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand. Its not only about dirt and cacti. There are flowers galore as well."
"2","At the DBG's for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughter's wedding. From the very beginning, Amber that young lady who worked with us was professional, on the ball and organized...far more than I can say about the wedding planner. I believe she must be the park's event coordinator and totally rocked it. \n\nThe place is truly beautiful, so different from what a \""traditional\"" garden looks like. Read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants, bugs, small animals, or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed \"" the birds with the hats!\"" \n\nThere were four other wedding going on the afternoon (4/29/11) but we never really heard much except for some far away music. Signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site *and the rehearsal the night before) and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use. \n\nThere was a very large room with shuttered windows and AC where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller, similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves. After the wedding, as the chairs and such were put away, the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour. \n\nMy daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars. \n\nIf you have your wedding at this particular site, park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area. It is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads \""Service area only.\"" I understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day, it would've been so much better to park in back and take a 5 min. walk as opposed to an agonizing 15 min. stroll. \nIt was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended, it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out. \n\nIt was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking (you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesn't eat in the dark.) Lovely place to have a party or wedding, parking not so great. \n\nThank you DBG for making my daughter's wedding so very memorable!"
"2","LOVE THIS PLACE!!! its a little over priced though which suck especially if you're a student as I am. This place is close to campus so you'd think they'd offer some kind of student discount, buuuuuuut the do NOT! its 18 bucks to go in and I love going here because I am a photographer but that adds up after awhile"
"2","Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly. \n\nBottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle, it didn't sting that I forgot to bring my own water.\n\nPark rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.\n\nWear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered - maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semi-famous hipster's Flickr!"
"2","I can't believe I waited 11 years to go here. I love nature. I love being outside. \nI'm in love. In fact, my first visit 2 months ago inspired my mom to get us both memberships. \nI loved the tour of the main loop. We learned a lot about some of the plants. I've worked in landscaping and know a lot about desert plants, but we learned a lot of cultural stuff, too. \nI went back for the Chihuly exhibit. It's the coolest thing I have ever seen, and some of the sculptures were so beautiful I cried a little. \nThe staff is a lot of volunteers, so you know they enjoy being there. In fact, I am going to talk to them about volunteering as soon as the holidays are over.\nI can't wait to go again!"
"2","Lovely, serene, and everything I needed before I started my week of class. Go in the daytime when cooler weather, and go at night when hotter.  They light up the place at night.\n\nI felt privileged to go when Chihuly glass displayed (till May 2014)."
"2","20% discount with AAA card :)"
"2","What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go."
"2","Beautiful!! Leisure walk around gorgeous areas. Bring a water bottle. Lots of restrooms about. Lots of shade and resting areas. Beautifully decorated as well! Gorgeous parabolas and fountains and lots of park helpers everywhere! The gift shop is adorable too."
"1","I have had terrible luck with this lawn service recently. Please do not furnish Sergio with your credit card number; he will put the card through on PayPal, which is very hard to stop when he is processing fraudulent charges. His crew stole a valuable tree-lopping tool from me at a house I was leasing right before I moved out. Then, after I moved out, he has billed me for monthly services for two months running because, despite being informed by me on the phone, he claims that I have to terminate his services in writing. \nThis is the worst consumer experience I have had in years and I feel that this behavior has to be stopped. I'm certain most people don't count obtaining a new credit card and taking a trip to small claims court as among the experiences they are looking forward to when hiring a landscaper."
"2","Stayed here for a long weekend for a friend's wedding in Mesa. Driving from Southern California, it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy! Check in was a breeze, the receptionist was very friendly- he gave us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out. Looks a bit outdated from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover- the rooms are definitely kept up very nicely! The room was so spacious! Upon entering, there is a couch that turns into a bed, with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it. There is a microwave, large fridge and everything was so clean! The separate room was nice, with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding. We went to the Belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but I guess that's expected for a hotel bar. We loved everything about the hotel, especially the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant. Buffett style, with a different main entree that differed everyday (like french toast, pancakes, and waffles) with sausage, bacon, yogurt, pastries and coffee! Would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my Dodgers!"
"1","They now charge for their Wi-Fi and for some reason I didn't have a shower curtain. When I went to complain the woman at the front desk did not care. She said do you need one now? And I stated I'm checking out why would I would need one now I want to complain. She then gave me a look with attitude and I walked out. I'll never stay here again."
"2","The staff are great. Actually the room is well noisy, but the kindness of all staff compensates for any other problem. I received several boxes in the hotel, I was not charged for receiving them at any time and any member of the staff made no comment about it. I really enjoyed all the hotel service and location (except for the noise) is great - very easy access. Recommend without any disorder."
"1","One of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas. \nWith that said the owner took our order and she was rude not friendly at all.....\n1. She get the order wrong\n2. She food was kind of cold\n3. Seen like she didn't want to be there (she is the owner) found out she was the when I was paying the bill\n4. She was trying to over charge the bill postings images of bill.  \n5. She never told us about the drinks weren't free refills \n6. Got mad when I pointed out that the bill was added wrong \n7. Slam the bill on the table when she corrected it. Even my girlfriend who is calm was shocked\n8. When the bill the guy owner said sorry for the bad service\nWhen noticed I not happy"
"1","BEWARE!! \n\nI had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. \n\nShortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. \n\nPhotos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles \""it must have vibrated off after service.\"" \n\n\nI may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever \""vibrated off\"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest."
"2","I read about their Operation Santa Claus holiday charity campaign via friends on Yelp (thanks Jolly!) and called in to make a donation to help those in need.  I am always impressed when a media outlet gives up their airtime to support a local charity....kudos to the team @ ABC 15 for putting together this event!"
"2","Some the best Indian food in the valley. I am reluctant to give five star on any place, always being the explorer, but I would go 4 1/2 because there is not damn TV and the atmosphere is excellent"
"2","not the best"
"1","Very boring pizza, if you don't like garlic, oregano, any spices, and think ketchup is pretty good then this is the spot for you."
"1","I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a \""slightly better quality school lunch burger\"".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings."
"1","The only reason they dont get 1 star is because I understand they aren't accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly panicked a bit when the Bad Brains came through.\n\nthat said, this place bites. 1. They blocked off half the seating, oversold the show, and then were kicking people out for standing. 2. It was a punk rock show following an AM skate competition. They were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated.  3. the bathroom situation is chaos. 4. the bouncers who usually work shows like Barry Manalow were acting like they were Hell's Angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band. 5. just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal.  Their punk kids man.  thats a lot of studs, chains, piercings, etc. What a hassle.\n\nIm sure its a great place to go see Celine Dion acoustic or something equally lame.  But why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me. I felt like i was in jail. Only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway."
"2","Dan is 'da Bomb!\n\nIf you want an HONEST assessment of the extent of your phone repair, and competent, reliable, and fairly priced service, Sun Cellular is the place to go.  If you want a pretty picture, a low ball price, then an unpleasant surprise once the other guy has torn your phone down, go somewhere else.\n\nBrought a phone in with an oddball part needing replacement, that needed to be ordered.  Dan was very specific; he let me know the part was unusual and needed to be ordered from manufacturer, how long it would take to get it, and the cost.  I wasn't thrilled with the wait or the cost of the part.\n\nI called a few other places, who told me \""yeah, we can have that done today (or tomorrow)...\"", widely varied pricing, all on the low side.   I asked them to verify that they had the correct part in, and NONE of them had it, and the cost and the wait time went up with all of them.  I can just see it now... you bring the other guys your phone, they tear it down, THEN tell you \""oops, gonna hafta wait, cost is higher\"".  Now you're a captive audience, and they have your phone.  BAD news!  \n\nNeedless to say, Dan got the phone, and fixed it.  He was right on the price, right on the wait time, he knows his business.  Labor fees are low.\n\nHe's got my business for life.  Thanks, Dan!"
"1","Massive sewer roach issue and I will scream it from the mountain tops until it is addressed. I fucking hate living here...They act like they're all over it but they're not.\n The staff fucks each other and the units are poorly maintained. They put a dog area right outside my apartment and people just bring their dogs to shit and piss...\n\nThe gate is constantly broken and there is no security here. When I'm in the pool at night I hear gunshots! When I asked about the shady online reviews at EVERY reputable online renters community/open forum my rental agent told me not to worry about it lmao!!!\n\nRENTER BEWARE!!!!! Please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here. \n\nI can't WAIT until this lease is up."
"1","When we called the Motel before we arrived, they said they had plenty of rooms available, but when we got there the manager spent about 10 minutes searching for a room for us (said several were in the middle of some maintenance.  As we went to our room, we noticed there were many rooms that did not appear to be occupied at all (the drapes were open and rooms were dark.)  This was the same story and situation the past 3 times we stayed here.  I think they just close rooms off, period.\n\nFound a used condom on floor under the bed and the wall near the sink had some drip stains from something I won't even hazard a guess about. There is no way that room had been properly cleaned or sanitized.  We will absolutely not be back here again."
"1","Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. \nI had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place."
"1","Hot links were very average. Terrible texture."
"1","I don't understand what all the hoopla is about. The food was lousy. The ribs tasted like the cow had mad cow disease. The sauce was weak. Overall, the food is overpriced. I've gone to this place twice and all I can say is I loved the beer!"
"1","I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.\n\nThe place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, \""Either this is a poor cut of beef/pork or both animals had mad cow/pig disease!\""\n\nI decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, \""Mad Cow Disease!\""\n\nI won't ever return. How does that go: \""First time shame on you, second time shame on me...\"""
"1","Not real impressed.  Sauce wasn't all that and sliced beef was tough. Trash can was full, restaurant wasn't real clean. Two small sandwiches and two sides came to $20.   Won't be back."
"2","Manager (Owner?) is very chill... Some people might not be used to it. It's a southern thing though! Lol... Anyways! The food is good, I always get either the pulled pork sandwich or the hot link sandwich. The BBQ is the ish!!!!!! I love it, can't get enough. I was reading some other reviews & all I can say is Love it or hate it, I happen to love it. PS: it's really not as bad as people make it seem... Give it a try."
"2","My family and I have had our Phoenix zoo membership for 1 year now. We love it! It is worth every penny. We go at least 1 time per month and always have a great time. The volunteers are extremely friendly, we have only met 1 who was not. Even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo. We play at the water park then go straight home. \n\nWe watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun. With a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace. Sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals. Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all. \n\nWe love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started. My daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo. At 5 she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat. \n\nNow, I must say... If you have been to the San Diego zoo, please realize that the Phoenix Zoo can not compare. So, don't go to the Phoenix Zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes. But, it is the 2nd best zoo I have been to. \n\nMy family is from a small city in Arizona. We moved to Phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children. I chose to live in S. Scottsdale specifically because the Phoenix zoo is about 2 miles away from my home."
"1","The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small."
"2","Me and my wife have a membership to the zoo - and well - would totally recommend it to everyone.  we use it all the time - heck i would go every week if she would let me.  there is just something about sitting at the zoo - in the weather - with the people  - enjoying the day.\n\nnot all animals look happy there, or comfortable for that matter, but some really do look like they are oblivious that they are at the zoo.\n\nit is a huge zoo - it would take most the day to see all of it.  it is so relaxing to just go for a coulpe of hours and then leave.\n\nwe have been where we didn't see anyone for 20 minutes, and on the busiest day and never felt that there were crowd problems.\n\nthe zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money - you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you - opportunity cost eh.\n\nmy current favoirtes are the big horn sheep up in the corner - and just sitting and watching the movement at the savana.  it is like my crack.\n\nsome people sit by the pool and relax - i site by the savana and relax"
"1","OK-so we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was \""the busiest day of the year so far\"" according to one of the workers.  We had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named Zach.  We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said \""you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat.\"" We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again raised his voice and people started to stare...he said \""you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.\""  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue, why not tell people when they get in the boat?  So ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $5.  They even had devised a \""hand signal\"" so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us.  The most curious thing to us was why didn't they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat?  They never mentioned it to us.  It seriously ruined our trip.  Zach, you really take your job way too seriously dude.  Oh, and I stopped payment on my debit card-take that!"
"2","Such a nice & fun zoo. The kids lived it!!!"
"2","Just a tip...if you're going with kids in the heat, pack bathing suits and towels and hit up one of the splash pads area."
"2","Though the name of the store has changed over the years, this brick and mortar has been around since I was a kid.  My grandparents have always referred to it as the \""ghetto market\"".  LOL  What can I say, some may feel that the neighborhood is a \""ghetto\"".  But cest la vie, it's the neighborhood I grew up in and went to grade school right around the corner.  You want a huge store with shiny new lights and fixtures, there's Fry's right down the street.   \n\nAnyhow, you simply can NOT beat their produce prices.  In fact, if I simply need veg for a dinner, I'll drive here than go to Fry's because Food City produce beat Frys.\nExample - \nFood City Bananas - 3lbs for 99cents.  \nFry's Bananas - 1lb for 57 cents.\nBuying Food City Bananas - 42% savings \n\nPretty sweet!  :)"
"1","Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history, then this place is great. This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.  Beware of the old men at the front as well, they don't seem too excited to have children there."
"2","The other reviews are right on. This place is so weird and sketchy I would never send my wife here. The inside looks like a great place to get murdered. I prefer to sit outside thinking about which direction I'd run if shit goes down. But the people are nice and they do a thorough job on the car for a good price. BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE CASH!"
"1","Well this has been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement. \n\nSo I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.  I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now."
"1","Played on 2/3/14.  Very poor conditions, both fairways & greens.  I would rate this as the worst course I have played in AZ.  Also the green fee of $85 is ridiculous.  Green fee does not include range balls, that were seemingly taken out of the desert & ponds.\nTwo thumbs down!"
"2","The smell, the vibe and feel as soon as I opened my car door was apparent. This is very Asian for the likes of pretty much every street corner in parts of LA. I only wish we had a more concentrated ethnic specific area beyond south Phoenix like LA.. or any other city for that matter. Hell, look at the Asian part of town in Vegas, its awesome!"
"1","Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.\n\nThe center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with \""Asian\"" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better."
"2","newly remodeled. lots of parking! Also known as county."
"2","If you have a Mercedes, you need to take it here! Being new in the area, I wasn't sure who to trust. I made the mistake of taking it to the dealer for an oil change and came out with a $300 bill. Seriously? It's oil and a filter. \n\nI tried this shop and found the owner worked at the dealership for 20 years before opening his own shop. Wow, nice people, and great service. He fixed what I needed and recommended a few things (the same things Firestore mentioned when I took it there for new tires and brakes, so I knew it wasn't an up sell.) I called around and M B Motors still had the lowest price. M B Motors fixed my car in a timely manner and showed me everything they did. \n\nTheir hours are early in the day 6:30 - 3:30 so it's convenient to drop off before work, but a little difficult to pick up. Nothing that would effect me taking my car there. Who wants to work on hot cars when it's 110 degrees out!\n\nI feel much better now that I have a place to take my Benz, especially being a single female and not knowing much about cars or what to do."
"2","I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos."
"2","Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far..."
"1","Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed. \n\nThe service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all. \n\nThe eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate. \n\nOverall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning."
"1","Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same reason as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.\n\nWhy do I hate it so...? \n\nPretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day. \n\nPeople walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free."
"1","Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money. Every time I tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect. So due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen. Came in to get it done. Show up, find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup. Ask if there is any way I can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do. Ask to speak to a manager. David. Who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells I can either wait or leave. I explain I have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day. But I have been here over 30 minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once. Overall the place is dirty. The wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude. I highly suggest never ever coming here. I know I will never be back. Ever."
"1","Wow..never thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference.  This place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar! \n\nCalled about 1:30 and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said \""no we are not hiring\"" and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added \""if you are in the business,  you should know not to call during lunch!\"" \n\nIts 1:30, past lunch time \""rush\"" and this bitch had to open her probably fat, pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment?! This was so uncalled for!!\n\nSo I went in this shitty place to complain (so glad I did not applied at this nasty ass place-which I did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is!) and asked for the manager. This  nasty toothless so called\""waitress\"" said he was bartending and was busy! I still spoke to this (piece of shit Is way too much nice of a word for this asshole!)manager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying \""if you are not a customer, I don't have time for your shit and come back later!!\"" \n\nWell the only time I would come back to this shitty bar if I ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms! \n\nHow can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way??!!  I would never eat here and wouldn't anyone else eat at this place!!"
"1","What happened to all of the coverage on the local sports?  The Arcadia News used to be very supportive and involved in Arcadia High School athletics.  No articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days.  Shouldn't a local paper support its local high school?"
"1","I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.\n\nThe menu is, of course, classic Applebee's, something for everyone.  But I found the service to be listless.  When I entered the restaurant the last time, the two hostesses were sitting down; they lifted their eyes to see me, and then reluctantly brought their bodies upright.  One of them greeted me without a smile, and slowly showed me to my seat.\n\nThe waiter who took my order only said about two words, and I was supposed to guess what my role was at that moment in the non-conversation.\n\nZombies have taken over this restaurant.  It's more \""Shaun of the Dead\"" than \""My Dinner with Andre.\"""
"1","Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible! For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's."
"2","I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a special place for me. I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country. Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning. \n\nSo this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough. I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \""550\"" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \n\nSo while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain. This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!"
"1","Do not eat here. Terrible."
"2","Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had. \n\nWe walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight. We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa. \n\nNext time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received."
"1","This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO."
"1","Planned to have lunch & a drink (alcohol) w/my dad & bf.  The server carded me (I'm 30!!!) , she \""I can't take this ID, it's vertical\"", when I gave her my (valid) license. I sat there till others were finished. Then I thought HEY! I have another (more recent) Government Issued ID! My Marijuana Medical License card w/my bday on it !! \n\nThe manager came out & told me... \""I'm sorry we can't take this ID either, *nervous chuckles*, we recently had a meeting on this, we cant take any of these ID's, sorry, I do believe that you're you. I know, I've been having the same problem cuz I'm 21 and I just had to get another license to make it horizontal\""\n\n\nI said, \""Are u kidding me? You won't give me a drink, even though you said u believe these ID's are me !?!! & my dad is right here.\""  \n\nThis is some bureaucratic bullshit!! WHY is Applebee's trying to FORCE me to go to the DMV, to get a 5$ license renewal, so it can be *horizontal* instead of vertical?!  Why the hell??? My card doesn't expire till 2049, whats the problem?\n\nApplebee's, even when I do have *the right* direction of license card,  you will NOT be getting ANY buisiness from me!!\n\nI ended up drinking water."
"1","Just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date. I've gone hear at least 30 times before and this is the first time that I can honestly say it sucked. They weren't really busy, since I went at 10:30 am. I hope this isn't a new trend."
"1","Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!"
"1","A very odd experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \n\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.  \n\nThe entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about."
"2","Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building. The decor inside was fun and had an old-school feel. Lots of pink and green, neon lights, mirrors, and wall murals. I loved it!\n\nWent in for dinner a little late, still being on west coast/vacation time, but there were still quite a few people and we weren't rushed at all. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu, even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs. \n\nWe started with two margaritas and the Espinaca con queso. Unfortunately it was missing spinach. Hmm... There were some green chiles, however, that added to the cheese dip. I ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce. OH how I love this white, creamy, spicy sauce!! Maybe a spicy sour cream? It was delicious! Hubby got steak fajitas which were good, but believe it or not, I was hooked on the grilled onions! They were so flavorful! I'm glad there were a lot on his platter so I could steal more than a few."
"1","Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive. \n\nAt least at Chuck E Cheese, the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head, or whatever, while you're waiting. Here, you just kind of bang your own head on the table."
"1","Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
"1","No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.  \n\nMy daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.  \n\nWhen the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals. \n\nMacayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can. You can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen. For the prices they charge, You have a right to expect better food. \n\nI will never go there again."
"2","It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes, I feel old considering I remember changing her diapers!) and I wanted to do something special for her. I considered using one of the online services (ProFlowers, 1-800 Flowers, etc.) but I really wanted the \""wow\"" effect of the flowers arriving all arranged and gorgeous. So (of course) I turned to Yelp and found Cactus Flowers. \n\nThey have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements (see \""Cactus Flower Exclusives\"" for prearranged, local delivery options), and they even offer national deliveries through FTD. I found a gorgeous bouquet and even had the option of adding balloons, chocolates, and a teddy bear. I went with the balloons because I was sending them to my sister's school and I just HAD to go for the best (AKA most embarrassing) visual display possible!! \n\nI placed the order yesterday (hooray for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you order before 1pm) and realized today that I did not specify delivery time. Having the flowers arrive after she's left school for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)"
"2","I ordered flowers for two friends. When I spoke to the designer about the size he was more then helpful with exchanging some of the flowers to create a bigger bouquet. It's almost two weeks later and my friend said they still look beautiful just as when they arrived. Both friends said they were lovely. I will use them again."
"2","I just love going here!  You can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have!  \n\nSo normally I go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine.  Or I grab some sake, which I absolutely love and can't find anywhere else.\n\nIt's at this point when I hit up their deli for a delicious tuna salad sandwich.  It's so disgustingly good, it's sinful!  The people that work there are so nice and helpful!\n\nAll in all, just a great experience!"
"1","Oh, AJ's. If you didn't exist less than 3 blocks from my apartment, I would never go to you. Although you have high-class pretensions, and several amicable sommeliers, your employees are aware that you are a ripoff.\n\nCase in point: I go to AJ's on St. Paddy's day, 2010, looking for some corned beef. 1 corned beef steak remains. About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon last year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap cut and preparation of beef) for under $10. I mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter, and I quote: \""Hahahahahahahaha!!!\"" -- Nothing else. No joke. They know they're overpriced. They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.\n\nFurthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.\n\nAvoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection."
"1","I was across the street for a Dr appointment and decided to step into the AJs after to browse since it was \""right there\"". Haven't been into one in years for the same reason that I probably won't return after the recent visit: way overpriced for things I can buy elsewhere. Almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store, and pay less for it. They do carry a small number of \""gourmet\"" items on the shelves, but I can find those other places, too. \n\nSo, you'd think that their deli or bakery or something would stand out, but not that I can tell. I was going to try something from the bakery case but it was all way overpriced and totally unimpressive looking. I was there in the AM so I did try a slice of the breakfast pizza that was out in the deli. First off, it took me several minutes to be served because the staff was busily ignoring me. Then when I did finally get my slice, I went to pay and eat it, and the thing was cold and chewy. The crust was just so tough. The eggs were somewhat dried out. I was seriously underwhelmed. \n\nThe store was practically dead the whole time I was wandering around. The staff outnumbered the patrons BY FAR. How do these places stay in business? You won't get more money from me AJ's!"
"2","Love the food, quality, and cleanliness. The staff Jimmy and Austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented. The few times I've been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should, that is what kept me from giving a five star. Otherwise, awesome place to eat."
"2","When I lived a block from Pane Bianco, I used to make it a point to spend (and eat) as little as possible throughout the week just to be able to grab one of their sandwiches (preferably the mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich) on the weekend.\n\nA little pricey, but worth every penny; the food is crafted so well that you start to dream about it and wonder when you can run back for more. If you're a coffee or tea fan, it's perfectly paired with Lux right next door; ample seating to eat your sandwich in peace and enjoy the people watching."
"2","The Housemade Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil sandwich is as good as it gets in the sandwich world."
"2","It takes me 25 minutes to drive there and it is well worth it. The food is phenomenal and considering its quality, the price is just right. The staff is also fantastic.   I am particularly fond of Tom who s very energetic and engaging.\n\nPane Bianco is an absolute gem and the kind of place I don't mind driving 25 min to get there. The fact that they are right next to Lux is also a plus.\n\nHowever, I can't say the same about dinner where I had the lasagna...For $ 16, it was an abomination, all there was in there was some tomato sauce, bechamel and meat sauce...no cheese or meat sauce...altogether a huge disappointment. Never having dinner there again..."
"2","Really good lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in, and the dine-in portion is relatively small for large groups). I'm a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding. They don't have much on their menu online, but the few items they do have, they do really well. If you order takeout, make sure to call in 15 minutes before your pick up time so that they'll have it ready. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for your takeout. \n\nIf you're going for a market sandwich, I recommend calling in to get their special. It can be a hit or miss. I got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy Joe. It had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat."
"2","The fish and chips is where it's at. The coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had. The shepherds pie is excellent as well. The best pub food in Phoenix by far."
"1","DH & I went for dinner there tonight, we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless, peas were tasteless, mashed potatoes & gravy, weren't very good either. Beer selection was good, but food was terrible."
"2","G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced. \n\nThe server was nice and everything went well. \n\nThe location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk."
"1","I like to focus on the positive so let's start there. The hot wings. Get em spicy hot. They were really good. Worth going here for? No\n\nIt's a dark bar, my date liked the English vibe of it.\n\nThe waitresses were slow (but pleasant) with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked. I ordered a Irish Car Bomb and got less than half a glass of warm Guiness, with the tiniest shot of baileys/whiskey. It was almost undrinkable. Then I ordered the $2.50 drink shot special which tasted like a shot of kool-aid.\n\nWe went for the Monday karaoke, and the DJ was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed. I've just been to better karaoke bars (i.e. Ernies)\n\nLike I said my date liked this place, so I guess YMMV. I think I would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par."
"1","Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately, it will probably be my last.  My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to go there for FATHER'S DAY.  We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!"
"2","I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it."
"1","I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville."
"1","Oh King George,\nKing of the Phoenix dive bars\nI live so close\nI require no cars\nYou have pub food of plenty \nAnd patrons a many\nBut consuming such grease\nMakes me feel like a piece\nYour beer doesn't please me\nAnd leaves me feeling slightly queasy\nA dungeon of darkness\nWith lights so dim\nA place void of nobles and youth\nMost patrons barely have more than a tooth\nMy visits here leave me full of sorrow\nI guess see you again tomorrow...."
"2","I love this location for Fed Ex. They were a life saver for me over the Christmas holidays. They are always cheerful and friendly when you come in. Even though when  they say hello many people do not respond. Rude people!!  Any way, the service is excellent it always gets there when they say it will. They are super quick when they help you and they will even package it up for you.  There are some really wonderful people working in the shipping dept. Chris being one of them. A truly nice person who really wants to help you as best as he can. If only more of us took pride in our job like that.  Great location, fast service, delivered when promised...what more could you ask for."
"1","Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again."
"1","Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back."
"2","I don't know why others had such a problem with the owner Petey: I went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine. Perhaps its because I've learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that I'm not \""just looking\"" but I'm on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and I hate chrome.\n\nYou would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place: tell the owner what you like and don't like right away. Letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates design; not just another customer.\n\nNow with that rant out of the way, I'd like to let you know that you'll find some cool shit here. Its a serious challenge to see everything there is in such a cramped place, so plan ahead to spend some time there. And for the love of God, don't bring your kid. In fact, go alone so you can make it around easier.\n\nYou wont find everything in perfect condition, but the prices are very reasonable. I felt like I was getting away with murder when I picked up a lamp last time. Go support Petey and his dog, they're good at what they do."
"1","If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering, waiting for the amateur service will.\n\nOh, you're still here? Ok, go ahead and order any of their so-called omelettes. Be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.\n\nThe way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning. Somehow they manage to ignore all of these suggestions. Yes, even the \""mixing\"" part. They apparently manufacture a plain omelette on one side of the kitchen, and then lightly sprinkle on whatever ingredients right before serving it.\n\nWhen paying my bill at the front I was asked, \""How was everything?\"".\nI replied in a polite tone, \""O.K.\""\nCashier boy responds in bewilderment, \""Just 'O.K.'?!?\""\nI finally leave him with, \""I'm being nice when I say 'O.K.'\""\n\nI'm sticking to Taylor's, Matt's and 5th Avenue Cafe for my weekend breakfast."
"1","Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.\n\nStarving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask."
"1","The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right? \n\nThe decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \n\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \n\nI am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time..."
"1","Wow. Just, wow. As a former employee of this location, I'm sorely disappointed. I used to be a hostess here and always LOVED the food. So I figured I'd take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo (always been my favorite) and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes, with chunky sour cream (ew) and a light sprinkling of chorizo. Um, what? I paid almost 30 bucks for this? The food was bland and not good at all. I couldn't even finish my meal it was that bad. I'll never go back. How disappointing. Maybe you should stop recruiting your employees/chefs from McDonalds. The good egg has really let itself go."
"2","I love this place! It's walking distance from my office that service delicious fast food.\n\nIt's a great place to grab a quick freshly made breakfast burrito or sandwich.\n\nThe lunch is very good too! They have a daily special that includes a side and a drink and they have good homemade type sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Korean BBQ Sandwich and they make an awesome tuna salad sandwich!\n\nTell them I sent ya!"
"1","This is a scam... They're pretending to be another shop and they're really sunwest auto trying to rip you off. The real Simon and sons is a dif number and address. I was ripped off and both shops were caught in lies when confronted. Going to the better business bureaus to file complaint"
"1","I like their variety in products, however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable, but they don't seem to do anything about it.\n\nAlso almost every single time I go to the pharmacy, they never have my prescription ready, even after they've called me to tell me it was ready. One day I called it in about 3 days early, just to make sure I could stop by anytime before I ran out to pick up my prescription.It turned out I wasn't able to pick it up until the day that I ran out anyway, and even though I had called in three days earlier, it still wasn't ready! To add to this frustration, I have gone in and waited for up to 3 hours for prescription to be ready, when I was told it would only take 15 to 30 minutes. Lastly, they have the automatic prescription refill, when they call you to tell you that it's ready when your prescription runs out. I signed up for this, however they didn't call me the last time I had a refillb ready because they weren't aware it needed to be refilled, and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when I showed up it wasn't ready. I'm sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions. I am taking my business elsewhere."
"1","This was my first experience eating Jack in the Box since I moved from GA to AZ 2 days ago. The service was horrible! Cashier had attitude when I told her I was still reviewing the menu. When I was ready to place my order she was very rude & sighing as if she needed me to speed up. Then I watched as she prepared her food, placed it on a tray & walked off as my food sat in the window. The drive-thru person came to see if I had been helped & proceeded to bag my food after I told him I was waiting. This place needs better service."
"2","Loooove Ide Mania! I go there mostly for waxing since I'm terrible about getting my hair cut, but I always see those getting their hair done smiling and laughing and their hair looks great. I'll be going there for this soon. \n\nAs for the waxing... Lily is AH-MAY-ZING! She's so sweet and fun, and she does the best job on waxing that I've ever had! They're quick to make appointments to fit your busy schedule and the ladies working are so friendly! You're missing out if you haven't been here yet! :) \n\nPS - Their prices are also great! Better than any other salon I've been to WITH better service and results."
"1","The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one star is because I really had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""Are you sexually active?\"" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience."
"1","Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check. \n\nI just wanted to try their salad. \n\nEvery fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right?\n\nWendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you."
"2","I took my phone out while walking around. \""No photography in the store, hun,\"" to which I replied that I was not. \""I know, sweetheart, I'm just sayin', there's no photography in the store, honey.\"" \n\nIt's hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff. Being called pet names by strange women does not help. \n\nI contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable. \n\nThis is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review. The general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior.\n\nThat really makes up for it. My greatest fear was that it was a given that if you're a woman in Autozone you're going to encounter condescending employees. I really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case.\n\nThanks for caring, AutoZone!"
"1","FILTHY! I ordered the 9oz house sirloin via Delicious Deliveries. The delivery was very late (not Applebees fault) and I wish we hadn't ordered from there even before I tasted my food. The serving portion was small considering the amount of money I'd paid. The mashed potatoes were filthy and the steak was like rubber, if it even was steak. I've had better steak from Swanson's frozen dinners! I asked for well done, not rubberized! I've never had such filthy food via delivery before. If I had been in the restaurant I would've sent it back, no doubt! Add insult to injury they didn't even include my side of veggies. So I feel completely ripped off and the food was nasty to top it off. I won't be going back here again! Worst experience!"
"1","Stopped in here a few months back.  Walking into the store it is very bright with florescent lights that made me feel like I was in an episode of twilight zone.  Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.\n\nThe staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \""all you have to do is ask\""....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \""well I know you'll be back\"".  \n\nDo people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?  Ekk.  Everything sold here can be supplied with the same general directions: 1) Insert 2) Turn on 3) enjoy.  No need for creepy chit-chat.  Just let me pay for my items and skeddadle."
"2","Dam I wish I would have known this place was here sooner. Really good sandwiches. They use Boars Head meat which I am a huge fan of. They have so many different sandwiches it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. The menu is kinda all over the place. There is a menu board but its old and fadeed but they have white papers with all the sandwiches hung up all over the wall. The staff  are very friendly and I'm sure this place has many regulars. Inside its a tight squeeze with limited seating. The macaroni salad is great as is the potatoe salad. I love the sicilian sub. The italian dressing on it is so really good and I think thats why I like this sub so much. My other fav is the club on wheat. Oh yeah I think Ill go there agin today. Sanwhiches range from $5.95-6.95."
"2","The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well."
"2","Great tasting food. Me and my wife were trying to find a great chinese restaurant that we could enjoy together since all the other ones we went to were not that great. We ordered Lemon Chicken with their chicken fried rice. Really big portions to share so we only needed one order of each! It was delicious!! The food got to us within 15minutes! Awesome atmosphere and nice service! Only problem is limited parking!"
"2","i am a sucker for this place. its not that is soooo fantastic, its that to me when i go to phoenix/scottsdale (to visit my snowmama)  i feel like im kinda in that albert brooks/meryl streep movie that i love where they die and are in some pre-heaven place where they can eat shit all day and never get fat so the portions are huge and obscene. i dont know why retired people get more food than the rest of us,  but the sad reality is that we do get fat when we eat huge amounts of shit. \n\nand while you can still get fat eating at this place (watch out for the choc chip cookies and the entire hot food section), you can be good, and pick the healthy good stuff and go back and feel good about yourself. its hard cause even though that pizza aint that good, after broccoli it aint bad. and again, those choc chip cookies are all over you- i dont really get why they cant leave them at the buffet but have to have some waiter come offer them to you ever 5 seconds. if you have some will power, its pretty good."
"1","The day radio shows have gotten worse ever since Darrell Ankarlo left due to his car accident injuries.\nBruce St. James is a moderate left leaning.\nThe afternoon guys are both Atheists.\n\nKTAR has turned liberal. I only listen to AM 550 now."
"2","Jeff P has it all right. I've been going to AABC for a really long time, and they've always been my favorite shop. \n\nThe owners are always up to help you, and the staff is excellent. No matter if I'm in 1 time every 6 months, or every week, Eddie always has my books pulled and he knows my box # by memory. I don't even know my box number.\n\nI've been going to AABC exclusively for years, and I see no reason to change.\n\nAtomic is trying too hard, and they don't care about you. Samurai is good, but not my style. They are great for indie and anime, but I'm a Marvel guy."
"1","I live and own my property for 11 years and the HOA will not do anything about the animal problem that has been happening for the past two years.  This cat keeps coming to sleep, release its feces, attacking birds and eating them on my property.  The HOA property manager Judy O'Claire tried to put blame on the Glendale Code Compliance as well as vice versa.  Nobody wants to take responsibility and now I have to confront the neighbors at 6402 W Lawrence Lane, hopefully I don't get shot at.  I don't understand why this management company does not take responsibility and continues to not enforce the CC&Rs.  For nine years they kept sending me warnings about my garbage containers being exposed on my yard and a few weed warnings which was not true, and now I have to deal with somebody else's wandering pet because the darn property manager thinks it's my problem.  Those neighbors need to stop feeding all the cats from this and other neighborhoods and start taking responsibility or jail, including Osselaer Company who will land in jail too.  Judy O\""Claire is a racist and discriminates against disabled homeowners, she will deceive that she does not know who I am when I have confronted her over two dozen times during the 11 years I've lived there.  Beware if you are having problems with the property managers, go to the president of the company."
"2","It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign."
"2","I've been taking my dogs to East Maryland Animal Hospital for 14 years, and I can't imagine going anywhere else.  Over the years my dogs have seen all of the doctors and each of them provided great medical care and advice.  \n\nAfter every medical appointment, I received a follow-up call the next day asking how my dog was doing and if I had any questions.   I wish people doctors were so attention!  \n\nThe staff is friendly and personable and always treated my dogs with love and kindness.  \n\nAll of my dogs have recently passed away after living long and healthy lives thanks, in part, to the great care they received at EMAH.   When we get another dog, we'll definitely be back!"
"2","\""The staff take time to \""know\"" us and our pets. The physicians are professional, expert in their field and very caring of our pets. They do not over prescribe, but stay on point and specific to any issues or concerns. We receive excellent care in the veterinary service, the staff, the kennel and the grooming. I have referred several friends and ... they agree. thank you.\"""
"2","This is one of those hidden hot spots in Phoenix that people don't know about, but should. The beer is excellent and the service was top notch. Really I would give this place a 4 1/2. Boyfriend and I both had burgers, which were meaty and juicy without being greasy. I ordered the beer sampler, which was a great choice for a first timer. Overall this place is great!!"
"2","Have stayed here before and very much like this hotel and its location.  Superb value.  They have done a lot of remodeling and still are working on a few of the final touches, when complete this is going to be a super nice property.  One thing that caught my attention and I think is really cool is the pool is 10 feet deep on the deep end.  When is the last time you saw something like that?  Most hotels pools are only like 4-5 deep due to fear of drowning liability.  I am a huge fan of deep pools and rare they are to find.  So for me that is another nice feature to this property.\n\nIt is in a quiet area of town and lots of neat things around to do.. just 3 miles from Camel Back Drive and tons to do on that road.. The surrounding beauty makes this property even nicer if you find flaws which every hotel will have."
"1","I went to phoenix skin in August 2013 to discuss about laser resurfacing. The doctor who I had met on that day had no idea about laser skin resurfacing and she gave me details about Blanca Fergoso, surgical coordinator  in phoenix skin care. I tried to schedule an appointment with her but when ever I tried to call her all the time it went to voicemail and even called the help desk to schedule an appointment with her but of no help.  I went to phoenix skin after lot of research and good reviews but of no use. If they won't care about their patients why would I recommend phoenix skin care please avoid Phoenix skin care."
"2","Last year, our very active toddler (then 2-yrs-old) was diagnosed with a bone cyst in his femur. Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft. Although he seemed very stoic when we first met him, we also have seen how much he personally cares about each patient... and their parents.\n\nWe are absolutely grateful for Dr. Shindell!"
"2","Must have been an off day last time. These partners are phenomenal!"
"1","Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.\n\nCruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. \n\nBut alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.\n\nWhile waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. \n\nSo he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.\n\n\""Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,\"" we say, playfully.\n\nThe DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with \""Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out\"" before walking off with his cigarette.\n\n\""What the hell just happened?\"" I ask.\n\""He thinks we're a straight couple.\"" \nI laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.\n\nI tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. \n\nI knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.\n\nI'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.\n\nOh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine."
"2","Girls are hot, dances are cheap, bouncers aren't power tripping. Everything a strip club should be. Only gripe is that I wish the back room was bigger and more private"
"2","This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.)\nONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening. \n\nOh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events."
"1","I had the number 12 to go. I was disappointed with this dish. It was greasy and had too much cheese. It was also fairly bland."
"2","Really, you guys think chips should be the basis of a good or bad rating????? wow how about the actual food, the real meal, not the free stuff in front of you to nibble while you are waiting.\nJuan's has awesome food, nothing I haven't liked yet, red, green, chicken, carne asada. you name it mmmm good.\nOld school eating without all the bells and whistles. They don't load the plate with a pound of cheese and a half a pound of garnish like some places (carlos O) does.\nNor do they just do 1 thing great and forget the rest- it's all great. And then you have other places that grill meat or do something fancy with fish/chicken or meat and slop half cooked rice and garbage beans on your plate. This is good home grown mexican food! Great family that has made an awesome business themselves. Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time, great neighborhood place too, that's why you see them do so many take out orders."
"1","This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. \n\nUnfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!\n\nI suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted."
"2","Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.\n\nThe outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.\n\nThey have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.\n\nThe food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.\n\nFor us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks."
"1","Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting, and then when we finally get seated guess what, it's another hour wait for our pizza.... Could have told us that before the first hour!!! Save yourself the 2 hours of waiting and go to Pizza Hut, you'll be much less dissatisfied. I would give this place zero stars if I could."
"1","I've left a review before saying that I love this place and they have great service!  Boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!! We had the worst service ever! He was rude and never came to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything! He kept passing by but would never come to our table. I was so disappointed!"
"1","Have been dying to try this kosher place for some time.\nWent tonight and ordered a large 3 cheese pizza.  O M G american cheese???\nI asked also for baked ziti and the lady said her ziti can't keep for a week so they don't make it.\nAre you kidding me?\nIt was 19.00 with a drink.\nI put the pizza in the trunk and went to La Bella"
"1","slow service. The banana blueberry bead was so so. Rolls were so so.  Sushi wasn't bad, not awesome. Service was total poops."
"2","Absolutely delicious, and a very pleasant surprise.  While it seems like a little strip mall joint, it's really quite pretty inside.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.\n\nEveryone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.\n\nOne thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. However, everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. Just don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill."
"1","So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)"
"2","I'm here pretty regularly, since it is within walking distance of my house. Sometimes I feel like I'm paying a bit too much, but I've started frequenting the specials and Happy Hour menu, which has alleviated some of that. I've tried the sushi, the gyozo bowl, the salads, and some of the pasta dishes. Everything has been pretty good.\n\nThe gyozo bowl is awesome. It reminds me of the spicy Korean ramen my mom would make me with mondu (Korean dumplings). It's pretty spicy and flavorful. I love sitting at the bar and ordering--things come out faster and you can watch with excitement as the cooks prepare the food. I've noticed a lot of the flavors run together and taste similar, but I'm okay with that because they're good flavors.\n\nFrom the outside, it really does look like a shady asian spot, but the inside is quirky and classy. The walls are brick and the decorations are well-chosen. It's a good place for a date or to meet a friend for a casual happy hour."
"1","I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it..."
"2","We loved this place! It's definitely a hidden gem. Service was awesome, food was phenomenal, and prices were reasonable. The waiter was very pleasant and gave great suggestions. We will be back!"
"2","I find myself at CherryBlossom a lot nowadays, and that's why I needed to update my review. I've discovered my new favorite menu items, and they must be eaten! So, you should try:\n\nSpicy Gyoza Pot\nCha-shu Ramen\nTanTan-Men Ramen\nUdon Suki\n\nThe gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.\n\nI have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!"
"2","Been desperately (desperately!) searching for a ramen place in Phx after discovering the deliciousness that is ramen in San Diego, and I was pleasantly surprised when I drove by the \""Noodles\"" sign on my way to a hair appointment down the street at Shampoo Ink.  Made a mental note to stop in afterwards for lunch. I am SO glad I did!\n\nService was stellar - really some of the best service I've had in a LONG time.  Super friendly and attentive.\n\nThe ramen dishes were all pork per the menu, but they were nice enough to sub chicken for me instead of the pork.  DELISH!  SO good.  No veggies like the place I love in Oceanside, CA, but still, the flavor was there and it was awesome.\n\nThis will be my new lunch place EVERY time I get my hair done."
"2","I've been here only once for lunch and I was really pleased.  I think the Bento Box is the best value, perfect for a quick lunch.  The decor is really surprisingly authentic to a neighborhood ramen-ya in Japan.  The staff were very nice.  I took a little tart with me as a treat for later, loved it, and wished I'd gotten more.  I'm definitely going back again."
"2","If it's a GREAT bowl of traditional Japanese noodle soup you're in search of, this is it. \n\nI'm sold solely on their noodle soup bowls that I haven't tried any of their other entrees. The bowls are big, you get a good amount for your buck in my opinion. \n\nThe TanTan Men is good if you're looking for a spicy soup.\nThe Miso is great if you're feeling a seafood soup.\nThe Hakata soup; you will not go wrong ordering this bowl. The noodles, the broth. So good.\nThe Cha-shu; is the Hakata but with MORE delicious pork included, you can't go wrong. And even if you don't normally eat a lot you'll have a hard time not wanting to eat the entire bowl. At least that's what I've experienced. \n\nBecause the place is popular and the space is small, you may have to wait awhile for service and to put in your order, but once you receive your delicious bowl of goodness you will quickly forget!"
"2","Been here a few times. It's a strange mix of foods (sushi, ramen, and Italian?!) with the ambiance more like a French cafe, but it somehow works. Their pad thai is tasty and I love the udon. The portions are quite large and they don't skimp on protein. Staff is all very friendly and it doesn't break the bank. I want to come back and try the ramen, the table across from me demolished theirs so it must be good."
"1","I went to an urgent care for a sprained foot. The urgent care provided me an air cast ankle stirrup (even though I sprained my foot!) that sells at Wal Mart for about $47 retail . Hangar Orthotics dba Elite Care billed my insurance $149.00 Insurance paid 74.50 as that was deemed reasonable and customary. I received a bill for the balance which is illegal in AZ where I live. ARS 20-1072. I wonder how many people receive these bills and pay them not knowing? I called up to dispute the amount, and although my call was third I have been waiting 94 minutes with an automated message saying my call is next ... it is now 4:59pm on Friday, I am doubting I will get an answer even though it has been saying my call is next for over an hour. It is too bad YELP does not have a way to give a business ZERO stars I waited until 5:30 and it kept saying I was next. They should have a way of giving NEGATIVE stars"
"1","Worst Drive Thru Service Ever!!! Sat for over 10 min such a pain in the ass. Cashiers are rude and still managed to screw up the most basic of orders. I will never come back here"
"2","We ate at Christo's for the first time and enjoyed the old school vibe   Great food   Great wine. Great service at a very reasonable price. Would definitely return. Our waitress, Stacy and Jose made us feel like regulars.  Looking forward to dining there again."
"1","We recently went to Clyde's Hardware for a replacement part for a bidet.  Salesman was helpful but had to order the part which he did on the computer or so we thought.  Told us the part was in stock, took our credit card payment and told us a day when the part would be there.  But they NEVER ordered the part!!  When I inquired, Debbie was curt to say the least.  Later called me and told me the part \""was on back order!\""  Not so according to the salesman.\n\nWhy oh why would we want to do business with them in the future?  We were required to pay shipping ($13.00 for a plastic part that weighed no more than 1/2 ounce) plus tax, plus made several trips to the store and to be treated like that??  No wonder amazon and other competitors are cleaning their clocks and they have a sign on their door not allowing photos."
"2","I miss Karsh's (no longer live in AZ), although I really like Bea's Bakery out here.  Chompies' bakery rivaled them on some items, but Karsh's made the BEST cakes.....I got one for my daughter's Bat Mitzvah.....and smaller cakes for birthdays and such.  Absolutely YUMMMMMMMMY.  Perfect cake, perfect icing.  Great challah, too.  Their other bakery items were also quite good....rugelach, hamentashen, brownies, cookies.  I'm just glad I didn't live close to them when I lived there.  Downside...they were always crowded, and I always had to wait awhile before getting served."
"1","I hate to bemoan the passage of time and the change of ownership ( granted, that's been some time ago); nevertheless, that's exactly where this review is going. My mom is from Germany, and I can remember coming to this place back when the counter staff would speak German with my mom. The had the best liver wurst. It was firm, but not dry, and full of flavor. Now, it's bland and tasteless. I never liked blood sausage, but my mom and two sisters used to adore it. No more. The selection isn't what it was. Commercially, this place seems successful, with lots of restaurants proudly advertising their stuff. But the old faithful have been left bereft."
"1","I came here looking to have my bridesmaids try on dresses. I'd called before hand to make sure they had the right dresses in stock and they said they did. But when I arrived, they couldn't find the dresses, the girl who was supposed to help me had no idea where to even find the section for a certain designer (their area of BM dresses was not that large), and when they gave up looking, they just left me. Didn't say they couldn't find them or that they weren't in stock. Then when I complained that they had said they had them on the phone, they blamed me and said I must not have said bridesmaid dresses when I asked on the phone. They were rude, unprofessional and I will never recommend them."
"1","Have not been here in years.  The food & the service were not good. And you would think that a margarita at a Mexican restaurant would at least be drinkable, but it was so sweet I could not drink it. It may have been an off night, but I think I will probably wait a few more years again to go back."
"1","This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area."
"1","Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!"
"1","I went to this shop based on the high ratings. \n12 days later, 2 loaner cars, $1200, many excuses, a second opinion that found the problem in minutes, and 3 chances later, the issue of new front struts and squeaking and rocking upon braking persist. The car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands. Will go to second opinion Tobias in Cave Creek next time. They seem far more on top of things."
"2","Bottom line: Scott's has a matzo ball soup so good I can't imagine how anyone could ever hate the Jews. Best bagels in Phoenix, hands down. Take your Einstein's and shove it.\nScott's has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast, traditional deli offerings, and a strong but semi random assortment of 'home cooking' type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants. I haven't spent a lot of time in delis in New York, but Scott's reminds me of the \""New York deli\"" I used to live around the corner from in Houston, down the street from the JCC - tasty, simple, and unapologetic, about anything. I love their soups, although their pastrami is not the best I've ever had. They have every flavor of Dr Brown's imaginable. The portions are huge - too huge, actually. I'm minuscule, so the prospect of a sandwich that is 3x what I can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that I only go if I know I can take a box home. The service runs hot and cold, but I've never not gotten what I wanted the way I wanted it, and if the waitress isn't looking at me with vague disapproval, I feel like it's not an authentic New York experience."
"2","food is still good , slice of pastami n rye is heaven on earth, with dr brown root beer no y ou didn't jgo for the ambience its those delcious heartstoping sandwhciches..and be patient you mave have wait for a table.. but you can always take out..smile"
"2","We had planned on going to the Rhythm Room, which is directly across the street, but they were still charging a full cover at midnight, and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail, we took our hard-earned cash to Friends.  Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.\n\nThis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.\n\nAlso, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo."
"2","Now let me preface this review by saying I am an East Coast gal with over 30 yrs experience in eating the BEST Pizza & I absolutely love the crust (hand tossed of course) @ Pizza Heaven. I was walking back from the Christmas light show and saw the PH sign in Neon Orange calling me into this place.  Right Choice. Since then I have been there weekly and sometimes twice a week.   The crust is crunchy and the cheese is delicately melting throughout.  I always get mine with pepperoni but when ever I spot someone else pizza looking a smelling divine (pardon the pun Heavenly) I change the order to find that I now have another favorite  Ranch Chicken Pizza. Who would have thought cheddar cheese would taste that good on pizza. TRY IT!!!!  One thing, service is different in the day time, counter lady is very helpful in knowing the menu there & that's a plus and when I come during the evening, the sit and be waited on service is not so terrific.The boys tend to sit at the counter and surf the phones and talk with the kitchen staff and forget about the tables. I'd rather come during the day or take out to get better service.\nWish they had a full bar to sit at that would be fun and an outside venue too."
"1","I love this place but very disappointed they took their best sandwich, the pizza grinder, off the menu.  I guess I won't be going here as much now."
"2","After returning from my trip from a big city fashion district, my inner creative genius led me to Sas Fabric. Upon entering the location I felt a gush of endless and surreal inspiration. \nWhy the fuss over a fabric shop you might ask? The fuss is over Sas Fabric shop! Move over Joanns, Walmart or any other ratty fabric place because no one beats Sas! An array of funky, bright, subtle, soft, crisp, shiny, and neutral fabrics fill your eyesight welcoming you to explore! My imagination was running wild in here! I felt as if I was at a true NYC fabric supplier! Other fabric stores in Phoenix simply do not compare and carry FAR less unique fabrics. Joanne is also more catered to the grandma crowd rather than the modern D.I.Y. creative soul. I highly recommened Sas for all fabric related projects. I've become loyal to Sas for its quality and superior selection. The staff is also very quick and experienced so they get you on your way to fulfill your creative urges! Five stars :)"
"2","If you like crafting and sewing this is the place for you!\n\nI needed about 6 yards of upholstery fabric as I am recovering my ratty old dining room chairs, and after some very frustrating searching through tables piled high with folded samples, old bolts and random yards, I nearly gave up then all of a sudden I found *exactly* what I was looking for: three different samples of Toile de Jouy, in pastel pink, green and blue!!  Yes!!   I was super excited to find it in all three colors.  And to add to the awesomeness of my find, my whole purchase, out the door, was only about $12.  Score!!  \n\nBe warned that this places is overflowing with fabric and sewing notions and finding exactly what you want can be a challenge, and their customer service is VERY limited.  But if you come in here with patience and lots of time to spare you will find exactly what you seek, eventually."
"1","If I didn't like how close this place was to my house or the giant selection of fabrics I would give it zero stars! The customer service is horrendous!  the people that work there are the rudest people I've ever seen in my entire life at a store. That's all"
"2","Rented space here for a couple years. Clean and convenient central Phx location. Great staff. Would highly recommend."
"2","My wife (who is from Phoenix and spent countless meals at this restaurant) characterized this place to me as the \""Gay Denny's\""--a label I was apprehensive about mentioning in my review until I read the the reviews of other Yelpers.  After seeing about a dozen or more references to \""Jenny's\"", I realized that my wife's characterization is not only accurate, but quite routine and popular.  Please note that even Yelp categorizes this place under \""Diners, Gay Bars\"".  That speaks volumes of coolness.\n\nThere is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.\n\nFood was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.  If you're looking for a great place to get some post clubbing eats, Jenny's definitely hits a Grand Slam.  Recommended."
"1","We go here late night around 2 am every night we get out of the club nearby. If it weren't for the fact it's 2 am and we're usually pretty hammered I would never stick around for that long to wait for our food to come out! There's usually a wait (even at 2am) the place is packed. There's always a cop sitting at the bar, haha. It just takes forever to get acknowledged when we walk in, to be sat, to have our order taken, to get our food, to get our bill, etc. It usually takes well over an hour for all of this. Under normal circumstances I would walk out of a place like that. If the servers were all really friendly it might make up for it but some are nice and some look like they'd rather be anywhere but there. Which is understandable I guess but still. I do agree that it is fun to people watch here."
"1","This place use to be nice to eat at.  Now it's a dive!  The restaurant is filthy, I got a water glass with Lipstick on it and our coffee cups had dried cranberry juice on it.\n\nI've been there multiple times thinking \""it's just an off day\"",  The last time I went there was a week ago when a friend was visiting from Palm Springs and I have to say, I was embarrassed after taking him there!  They got his order wrong, our dishes were dirty and the waitress seemed annoyed that we even mentioned it.\n\nI will never go there again."
"1","look at me...I'm standing here and i'm boring...look at me...look at me....\n\nthat seemed to be the general vibe here.\n\nnothing special."
"1","Eh...I really WANT to like this place, but it's become a little run down over the years.  I would jump at the opportunity to go to a \""true\"" gay sports bar, but this place just doesn't cut it.  It really needs to be about 1000 sq feet bigger to achieve the sports bar feel.  Plus they have these really old circa 1991 TV's to watch sports. (A costco run for some LCDs would go a long way here).   Beer is beer. When people play darts the place get's even smaller.  If only they would get the gay sports leaugues to commit to going there on a more regular basis...it's so hit or miss. \n    This place has SOOOO much potential, but it seems the owners are very happy with the status quo."
"1","To be honest, this place sucks so much as compared to how it used to be. Like all vintage clothing stores, you have to dig through piles of crap to find that one diamond in the rough. Buffalo Exchange is no longer like that store. Now, you just dig through garbage and getting nothing out of it but a grimy feel and a fetid stench of indigence on your hands. I also found out, after selling some clothing here that Their selection here just sucks.\n\nThe only thing that's generally alright is their shoe selection. I got a pretty sweet pair of Nikes for $30."
"2","New year, new clothes, time to update my closet.  A great way to sell some clothes for cash is at Buffalo Exchange.  They give you 33% for the value of the clothes or 50% for in store credit.  The staffs are so friendly.  I just love the store that doesn't smell like something died like other consignment stores."
"2","I write this review strictly as a seller, as I never come here solely to buy, always to sell and sometimes to trade. If you trade in items, you will get 35% of the retail price in cash or 50% in trade credit, period. The young ladies who run the shop are razor sharp and know the tastes of their shoppers. The store has an interesting selection of accessories and clothing, the quality of which runs the gamut from cute cheap Chinese crap to OMG is this really $15 superior quality items. Look and look often because inventory turns over and fast. If you want a quick hit of something unique or need to offload some extra items, make a beeline for this place. It's environmentally responsible and they have a donation program for local nonprofit agencies. This is NOT a thrift store, so leave that notion at home. It's a secondhand shop that thinks like a consignment store. You pay a little more than a thrift store but you have a much greater chance of finding something fantastic in pristine condition."
"1","I like domino's pizza when I just want to have cheap pizza delivered.  This location however is awful.  They have messed up the last 3 orders.  1, the crust was missing its seasoning completely and the cheese was half missing - what?  2. the order arrives well over 30 minutes late and wasn't piping hot like you expect.  When i called to check on my tardy order, the manager Carla was rude and told me \""not to worry about it.\"" What again?  3. I ordered a hand tossed, to hopefully get the garlicky crust I missed out on previously, and they delivered a pan pizza 10 minutes late.  How does one make the online order THAT wrong?  It prints out.  There are only so many crust options.  Carla was rude this time too - if you mess up okay, but don't make it worse by treating your already frustrated paying customer like crap."
"1","This is the first time I've had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasn't close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldn't that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didn't trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store."
"2","My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)\n\nI'm just going to add my own two cents...\nAfter reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!\n\nIf you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!"
"1","If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, \""oh yeah sure\"". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing. \n\nAnyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. \n\nAt the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works."
"1","Ok, so this was really incredibly depressing.  We had heard such wonderful things about this place, and even really enjoyed mother's day brunch here.\n\nBUT, when we went here last night for our anniversary dinner, it was incredibly lackluster.  the brie brulee was ok.  my husband's filet was very underwhelming (though the risotto was delicious), my pork was good, and the four berry tart was yummy.\n\nThe problem was that we could have spent that money somewhere else on an even better meal.  Having moved recently from San Francisco, we try to stop ourselves from over criticizing, but we've found some real gems in Phoenix.  Coup des Tartes is not one of them. :("
"1","Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice."
"2","went here for restaurant week and the service was amazing. They took a little longer than normal to serve our food so they gave us free dessert and appetizer. The food was good and this place looked like a little cabin, giving it a nice homey feel."
"2","Great location, nice quaint studio, pretty good prices. Patrick is a world class yoga teacher - his classes are the BEST"
"1","Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!"
"2","Go here for happy hour... which I believe is until 6:30pm? Great deals on drinks and the food selection isn't too shabby either. \n\nWe (me & the  BF) ordered the chicken quesadilla per recommendation of the bartendress- great recommendation. That lil pocket of deliciousness is STUFFED with chicken and cheese plus you get all the naughty fixin's on the side (guac, sour cream, salsa...) as well.\n\nAll of the other food is still your standard, delicious Mexican... still very reasonably priced.\n\nDitching your vehicle is very convenient, plenty of parking in the back. Air conditioning is always 'full-blast.' Can order pitchers of margs frozen or on the rocks during happy hour.  \n\nCouldn't ask for more on a 115 degree day :)"
"1","Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough. Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland.  Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices.  A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference   The rice was the most bland.  The  quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town."
"2","The Mexican pizza add beef and cream cheese is to die for!  Their fried ice cream is the best ever.  The chili relleno is very flavorful and delicious.   My favorite Mexican food  restaurant!"
"1","My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. \nOur wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. \nThey did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. \nThe one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences."
"1","I went into this location and had a coupon for a buy one foot long sub get the second one for 99 cents well my total ended up being $15.76, sounds a  bit high, well my preparer Hector \""Clerk 21\"" did not how to use the register and called another employee to ring in my coupon, which they did not apply obviously since my bill was almost $16.00 and they were cursing and were rude and were complaining about how they did not have time to mess around because they had a party platter order they had to prepare. Very disappointing, maybe Subway should invest in better training or maybe higher wages to get better staff."
"2","Hand's down this place is my favorite store in Phoenix.  Actually, it's my favorite store in Arizona.  I would be hard pressed to find a place cooler than this that caters so exactly to my every need and desire as a baker.\n\nI first came here when I was searching for a place to find cupcake liners in bulk.  I had just received an order from the school I work at to do cupcakes for their homecoming.  400 of them to be exact.  Ordering liners online would prove to be too pricey as would buying out every store's stock.  Somehow, even though I have driven by many many times, I did not even know this existed.  Now I certainly do.\n\nInside you will find a menagerie of things to delight everyone from the amateur baker to the professional pastry chef.  You will see rows of sprinkles, hundreds of cookie cutters, a rainbow of food coloring, dozens of specialty cake pans, and cake toppers galore.  I have never gone here and walked out unsatisfied.  I always find what I need.  \n\nIf I could walk around this place with a plate of bacon from Matt's, I would seriously think I had died and gone to heaven.  If you are ever in need of anything related to cakes and cake decorating, give this place a shot.  You will never consult a big box craft store for your needs ever again."
"2","This place must be heaven for those that are serious about their baking... \nI'm quite an amateur, but was super impressed nonetheless with the amount of baking tools and supplies that are squeezed into this store.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I went in with a grocery list from my sister-in-law.  I needed to get red chocolate to melt, red sprinkles, and white and black frosting in a tube.  Our plan was to make \""Muno\"" pretzel rods (from Yo Gabba Gabba).  ABC had everything on my list and more... I ended up purchasing special candy \""eyeballs\"" instead of the white and black frosting and they worked perfectly!  (They came out super cute by the way and were pretty easy to make too!)\n\nI also bought some candles and a spatula.  I could have done a ton more damage; there were so many fun baking accessories there from cookie cutters and cake toppers to edible glitter frosting and special molds to make suckers, cake pops, chocolate, etc... they also carry really cute shaped pans, packaging, and more. \n\nWhether you're a professional, or just an amateur looking to do a little baking of some sort, check this place out - they are locally owned and have been around since 1965.  They must be doing something right!\n\nAdditional tip: they offer all kinds of classes!"
"1","They lost my clothes and three weeks later they still had not resolved the problem.  The manager was supposed to call me but didn't until I showed up in person and insisted.  Their idea of resolving the problem was waiting to see if they ever turned up on their own. Scary when their response was \""what we usually do in this situation...\""  They lose clothes that often?!?!  \n\nWhat clothes they did return were either wrinkled or stiff as cardboard (I requested light starch).  One pair of pants were torn.\n\nIf you value your clothes, do not use this incredibly unprofessional business. Go to American Cleaners instead.  They are friendly, professional and very well priced."
"2","Pretty good subs. The pastrami is to die for."
"1","Holy cinnamon all up in your face!  Cinna-cones, cinna-brooms, cinna-wreaths,  cinna-scents galore! Everything smells like cinnamon and I hate the smell of cinnamon! I even smelled like cinnamon a day after going into the store.  I burped and guess what it smelled like? CINNAMON! \n\nHappy Holidays"
"1","Weird place. Definitely a dive bar. Certainly dive bar customers and decor. The place is tiny with about 50% of the real estate taken over by a pool table. \n\nWhy is it so bright!? If you are gonna be a dive bar turn them things down!\n\nWith the Swizzle Inn (one of the best dive bars ever) across the street I won't be back."
"2","Sometimes a girl gets a wicked hankerin' for some chicken fried steak, mashed taters, and white gravy.  You know that what she does?  She goes to Texaz Grill.\n\nFor a ridiculously satisfying and heart clogging meal, you can't beat it.  It's got a casual and fun atmosphere, and it's extremely reasonably priced.  And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister."
"2","Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."
"2","This place is known for their chicken fried steak.  And they certainly do it right.  They have a billboard that is a running tally of how many servings of chicken fried steak they have served....now that's confidence in your product!  But if you feel like something else, they have an amazing prime rib (you have to get there early though....they only make a certain amount of prime rib each night and when they run out, they run out).  If you want something a little smaller---and that's not saying much, since their portions are huge, get the brisket sandwich, ask for the bbq sauce on the side, and ask for a side of au ju.  You won't regret it.  It's amazing!!  \n\nDon't expect some fancy schmancy steakhouse--but go hungry and you won't regret your decision to go there!"
"2","This has been on my AZ bucket list for years and decided to drop by tonight for dinner with the family. From chatting it up with some of the regulars, to the \""Texas Trivia\"" with the owner at our table. The food and the vibe here were absolutely wonderful. Will definitely be back again and again!"
"1","I'm into these long winded reviews...don't have the time.   This place is not any good.  Don't waist your money."
"1","Kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout.  If I liked the burger, I'd recommend only ordering it to go.\n\nI went with a patty melt, and was not impressed.  The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea, and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor, but I wouldn't call it good.  Aside from the wine flavor, the meat wasn't very good anyway, just like the other fixins and the fries.  Combined with the atmosphere and general grungy feeling (I don't know how sanitary the place is, but I wouldn't bet on it passing inspection), I definitely won't be back."
"2","I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.\n\nWalking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.\n\nThey have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.\n\nThey have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.\n\nIf you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one."
"2","Dive bar feel, but possibly one of the best burgers I've had. Made to order and seasoned perfect. The wings are also good."
"1","Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked \""Do I want that to go?\"" Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?"
"2","awesome burgers.  decent service.  good atmosphere.  it's a dive bar.  just fyi.  with good food."
"1","What?? No raw salmon? Only smoked?I am tres cornfused. Am I at a bagel place or a sushi restaurant?\n\nSlow service. Limited sushi menu. Bland Miso.\n\nNO RAW SALMON.\n\nEnough said, I won't be back. Too bad it was my only Saturday sushi lunch option (Zen 32, I'm looking in your direction...)."
"2","Happy hour is designed to make one happy. The fact they had one sat evening with things I like on it made me happy for a new hours.\n\nThere are a few 1/2 priced sushi rolls like a Spicy tuna and Phily roll. 1/2 some apps and beer $3 specials. \n\nThe rolls are regularly 7.50 ish so 3.50 on happy hour, as for quality it was decent however with a spicy tuna or Phily roll it is hard to really mess them up. The added avacado to them was nice.\n\nWe also had a veggie spring roll $3.50 Then 1/2 off for happy hour.  A soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies sushi rice and peanut sauce. It was great like Vietnam meets Thailand.\n\nThey were nice enough to turn down the loud music for us make it a pleasant place to be, the curtains are cool and the beer selection included some micro brews. Not bad at all."
"2","The straight dope:\n\n4.5 star bar for hopheads and craft brew fans:  Not particularly extensive in terms of number of offerings, but some sincere thought was put into the list and the result is a spectacular night's worth of excellent brew sampling.  Well done!  It would be nice if they had 12-year Yamazaki single malt to really put the cherry on top of their Japanese theme (even Benihana has that), and that would probably double my frequency of visits, but I guess they have plenty of the ordinary mid to top shelf liquors.   \n\n4.25 star ambience/decor.  Dark and modern.  Just how I like it. \n\n4 star sushi/sashimi:  Our party of six tried about six rolls.  Nothing was left on the plates when we were done.  I found the quality to be high, but the execution and taste forgettable.  My wife would certainly disagree - she had the \""Senorita Roll\"" on her mind for many days after we went there, and she went back again 2x over the span of 2 weeks just to get it.\n\n4.25 star dishes and appetizers:  The spicy riblets are INSANE.  One would think that a chef would be a bit fearful of putting something out that is so intentionally overcooked and brittle...but it works!  And I think that is what is special about Moto...the menu has a nice dash of daring, unconventional twists on what could have been (and often is) just very ordinary fare at other places.  \n\nPS - the portion sizes of some dishes (like yakisoba) are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here, so if you attend with a group, don't be afraid to \""underorder\"" a bit and to share it family-style."
"1","Here's the thing... shortly after being seated the waitress spilled an entire pint glass of water DIRECTLY in my lap.  She was extremely embarassed and very apologetic, and I was good natured about the incident because after all, it was just water.  However, what bothered me was the fact that no manager or lead came to the table to apologize or at least buy me a beer.  There are three people at my table cleaning up ice and water, and an hour later I leave your restaurant STILL wet and you can't take a moment to address the situation? It left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addititon, the happy hour menu is rather limited and the sushi isn't bad, but not memorable either.  I'd much rather do happy hour at Ra or some other more consistant establishment."
"1","Stopped in here for lunch one day and wasn't pleased with the experience. The rolls were warm and fell apart. The service was fair at best and the place wasn't even very busy. Not that Phoenix is known for it's Sushi, but you'd expect better from a place like this. All that said, the menu is a hoot and worth a read, just don't order anything from it."
"1","The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet."
"1","If I could give this place a negative star I would! I have been coming here for years the service is has done a nose dive in the ground!!!! The service has is HORRIBLE now ! Went there for take out when I got home the order was completely  wrong the one thing they did get right was cold! I called let them know what was my order was incorrect and went back to wait another 15 minutes for them to correct it. I told them that part of my order was COLD and they said they would not replace it because it was what I ordered and there  was nothing wrong with the food it was just cold.  The manger or what they hired as a manger said she could reheat my food  and to replace it would cost them money to replace it. I asked  for a refund and she was NOT going to give me my money back. Finally she went into the back and asked some other person what to do which he seemed to have so sort of customer service. He told her to give me a gift card for the amount of the of the food! What I am going to do with a gift card to a place I am not coming back to!!! When asked to speak with him she told me he was not the manger but yet he seemed to tell her what to do !  It's a shame I expect this type of service from a large chain but not from a small business  ! Sad to say but I will not be returning and I will be telling others so they don't get ripped off!"
"1","Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all."
"1","I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well, but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should, for the most, part leave it long...she's a schnauzer, he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought, although last time it literally only took an hour, but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great, but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochie's ever again."
"2","I want to review the salon there, particularly Kristina.  When I walked in, I told her that she could do whatever she wanted to with my hair, and just gave her a few basic guidelines.  My cut turned out amazing!  I now have this punky choppy awesome cut, which I love and get compliments on all the time!  She is not the super chatty or gossipy type, which is fine with me - though I know some want that from their stylist.  Also, she is not as good with color as she is with cutting, but with suggestions from the other stylists my color turned out great as well."
"2","I was in BAD need of a GOOD haircut.  I knew I wanted bangs, some layers, something cute and sexy..is that possible?  Yes it is when you have Kristina cut your hair!  Wow!  She was really great.  She took the time to educate me on what's best for my hair, different bang styles, etc etc.  Also, Kristina wasn't a Chatty Cathy...which I loved.  Sometimes I like to just sit in quiet and be alone with my thoughts.  She allowed me that space while still giving me pertinent information.\n\nThe only thing is that I would have liked to know up front what all the extras would have cost.  Shame on me for not asking though.\n\nI already prebooked another appt with Kristina, that's how happy I am with my cut."
"1","I use to like Ulta. At least, I think I did. I often went to the Ulta at MetroCenter before it closed, and when it did, I had no choice but to start visiting this Ulta. If it were not for the specific makeup I needed I wouldn't bother coming here. The customer service is non-existent. These so-called makeup artists or whatever they are, shouldn't even exist. To this day, not one of them has ever offered to help me when I go to the store. They stare at me when I walk by but continue chattering away to each other, or seek out the one blonde in the store. I walk in, pick up what I need and get the heck out of there. \n\nThe stuff is overpriced. You can get the drugstore brands of makeup for way cheaper anywhere else. The coupon thing is a joke. The points are a waste. Spend hundreds of dollars for a free hair brush?! Are you kidding?!"
"1","Terrible service by the sales staff on the floor of the store. I was in a discussion over a item that I was buying for my wife and the sales person allowed a young lady with no apparent manners to interrupt and ask a question that went on to a conversation as if I was no longer there. I could  allow a quick question, but to engage in a ongoing conversation, by the staff associate and the rude customer who interrupted was to much. The sales person should have had the training to be professional and tell the person to wait a moment instead of engaging her as if I did not matter. F$%K this place and the management who allow this type of behavior..Shop elsewhere.."
"1","overpriced for \""beep-beep-beep\"" everything, but some of the table jukeboxes work!\n\n--omelet was too perfectly formed to be freshly made, ew. where did it come from?\n--they must have silenced the microwaves, or the beeping from the \""kitchen\"" would have drowned out the music.\n--not much food prepared here, just reheat, serve, and charge a bundle for it\n\nThe recent availability of mostly-ready-to-serve food provided by Shamrock and its local competitors is mostly just scary. Don't have a grill? No problem, we can make your eggs benedict for you, almost-ready-to-serve. No toaster? No problem. We can deliver it pre-toasted. [stepping down...ok i'm done now]\n\nI loved being able to select diner tunes from the table's mini-juke. It worked too! Note: some of the tables' jukes are possessed by demons and may suddenly start, or not work at all. Take your chances when dropping your two-bits.\n\nI love the vibe, just not the food. Unfortunately, that's what I go to a restaurant for, THE FOOD."
"1","I've shopped here before. Overpriced livestock & fish supplies. Customer service was not that great. Petco has better pricing on supplies and good selection of reasonably priced freshwater, live rock & saltwater livestock."
"1","Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.\n\n  My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold. \nNo bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.  \nThere were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.\n\nWhen a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, \""thank you.\""  All the \""Best of Phoenix\"" favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old.\nThe bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird.\nWe vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town. \nSave your money."
"1","How this place stays in business I have no idea. Food is gross,  the place is empty all the time, small dishes, over priced. Service is totally crap. The parking lot  looks like a place one could get raped in. If you're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building. Pot holes everywhere, I can't believe they haven't been sued yet for the condition of the parking lot."
"2","Finally, thanks to the reviews on yelp, I've found a mani/pedi place that I like, reasonable prices, clean, prompt and good.  I've had Tran twice now and have been happy both times. I like my nails to be oval/natural - no dragon lady nails for me.  I have been all over Central Phoenix for my toes and fingers -  disappointed in most of the places I went.  Really happy with Tran and DV nails."
"2","Very reasonably priced and a higher quality pedicure than I expected.  I will be returning."
"1","DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! \nMy husband went to get a manicure and they cut his finger and he got sever INFECTION and it is very swollen!! He had to go to the doctor today!"
"2","Yelp probably isn't the place you'd look for a dentist, but I'm glad Amy posted a good review because that's what brought me into Dr. Radcliffe's office.  I've never been happier with a dentist.\n\nI like to say that a dentist is only as good as his reception staff, and sometimes a bad front office ruins the best dentist.  Not the case here -- the staff is as awesome as the dentist.  And the office is awesome as well, bright and modern the way it should be.\n\nDr. Radcliffe is very approachable... extremely nice and quite good at what he does.  He treats you like a member of the family. \n\nIt sounds weird to say, but I don't dread going back (and I'm not worried when it's time, because they've always gotten me in whenever I wanted)!"
"1","They forgot a $3 bagel and when I call to inform the manager says it's no problem and to come back in the next day for a replacement. The next day I did that very thing, except the manager was not working and told nobody about the mistake. \n\nSo there I am the next day with a skeptical staff of employees thinking I am trying to scam them. They were getting ready to give me the shorted bagel after they asked me 5 questions, but by that time I was embarrassed in front of a crowd of people, which quickly turned into anger and I walked out donating to a company that does not appear to need donations.\n\nThere was another indecent a week earlier where I ordered a Bagel Strudel and got some hard stale loaf of something with nuts and berries in it. I ate 1/2 and threw it away and never complained."
"2","CHIPS and SALSA (2 kinds) and BEAN DIP all while you wait for your food.  Don't bother ordering appetizers, the chips and dips will satisfy you.  If you like margaritas, order the jumbo marg and sit in the nice air conditioned room.  Arriba is Mexican food, nothing fancy with a twist- just good ol' Mexican food.  You know the kind you eat and say \""why oh why did I just eat all that?\"".  I come here ever so often.  I had the carnitas just recently and was was very happy with my meal.  Have Fun!  Prices range anywhere bettwen $9-$15ish."
"1","My wife and I used to love Arriba's, til recently when we joined some friends at the end of their table for dinner. We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.\n I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.\n My wife said, \""No-we want our check only\"" and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.\n This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back! \n\n Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.\n\n Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's."
"2","Awesome food. First time here so I can't guarantee all the items, but what I tried makes me think the menu is promising. Wow. Yum. And they have a daily special that's happy hour prices. Not to mention the awesome chips and dip (mild, hot hot, and spicy bean dip) that come out as soon as u sit. Yum!"
"2","Finally doing a review after visiting Arriba's for years. This past stay stuck with the Chimichanga with Machaca beef covered in Green Sauce. Loved it! Over the years got the Posole (since I have a Posole addiction); but I resisted this time. If you like spicy head to Arriba's. They also have great margaritas, had the mango margarita. Will be back again!"
"2","The margaritas wont do ya dirty!"
"2","Hubby and I love this place.  Good service, great food, OK prices (hence the 4 stars).  Have had the fondue appetizer twice here and it's awesome.  Get it on happy hour!  Dinner entree I had was a chicken dish with mashed potatoes - A-mazing.  I'm always a little hesitant to order chicken because it's often dried out, but this was moist and delicious.  Had a starter caesar salad which was \""ok\"" - maybe had a little too much anchovy in the dressing for my liking?\n\nOverall a terrific place, and we'll certainly be back.  Mondays they have happy hour 3pm to close!"
"2","Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. \n\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. \n\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!"
"2","We love this place.  It's close to home and never disappoints.  I can honestly say, that I've never eaten anything I don't like.  It's always a sure thing."
"2","Let me start out by saying that my ONLY critique and the ONLY reason I didn't give them five stars, is I made reservations on Open Table and because of a lot of people lingering in the restaurant, they put us in the bar.  But, I have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent, the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful.  I had their 16th St short rib stew (and kuddos that you have a small portion option) and it was scrumptious.  I practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when I don't offer to have anyone taste my dish.  It had been a long time since we were there and I doubt if it will be a long time before we go back."
"2","This place is by far my favorite place to eat. My first time going there my parents took me for my bday! Their eggplant bites and corn cakes are thee best appetizers. Their bread pudding is thee best sweet thing I've ever put in my mouth! Thumbs up to this place!!"
"1","Worst Best Buy ever.\n\nI just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item.  Treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy something?\n\nMethinks not.  Never again.  NEVER again."
"1","Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business."
"1","Best Buy,you really suck.\nTried to buy a camera the other day.\nMid day,mid week,store pretty empty.\n3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options.\nNo one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible.\nNo problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices.\nI think I have it,I'm ready to select.\nWhere'd everyone go?\nI'm so lonely.\nI start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section.\nnope.\nMaybe around by the video cameras.\nNope nope.\nUnder a display cabinet?\nNah,that would be silly...\nThey were just gone.\nPoofed.\nVanished.\nVaporized.\nI decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens.\nYes,I said \""nefarious\"".\nI became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's.\nWho would protect me?\nThe aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me.\nI couldn't possibly stop them all.\nThey would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me.\nI would be defenseless.\nFearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices.\n1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization.\n2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me.\n3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera.\nGentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3.\nNew camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive.\nSince all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve.\nRemember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out.\nThank you,come again."
"2","Liz is amazing! Such a wonderful person and business owner! The way she treats her clients is unheard of now a days. I highly recommended that if anyone is looking for a great groomer, puff and fluff will treat your beloved pet like royalty."
"2","Fantastic business - the best in town!!! I so appreciate the love and care these ladies provide to my kids when I drop them off. They always look AMAZING when they come home with cute hair or clean teeth. I am obsessed with my little dogs and hate leaving them with strangers. These gals are like family!!!"
"2","First things First...\n\n\nLOCATION: \n\nCamelback Barber Shop is not easy to find if you don't know where you're going. It's located in the Camelback Colonnade shopping center. More specifically, it's in the alley between the Hallmark store and ULTA, which even More specifically, are located next to Michaels Craft store. If you don't find it with those instructions... I can't help you.\n\nThe rest of the story:\n\nPrior to today, I've had one haircut in Phoenix. It was in Arcadia and the place was okay, but I just wasn't feeling it. A lot of the places I found in the Arcadia/Biltmore area were just too hoity toity based on the pics I saw. And pricey. Then I noticed some of my Yelp Phx compadres had been to this Camelback Barber Shop. All of them with good things to say. \n\nI walked in and it definitely isn't pretentious by any definition of the word. If you want eye candy or upscale, this is not the place for you. I think it was very comfortable. My barber Alex was friendly. We made some small talk, including comments about the episode of Pawn Stars that was playing on TV. I can't stand that show...\n\nTelevision show preferences aside though, I would like to say that I have found my new barber shop! The cut I got here was better than the previous And it cost a little less. I actually think Alex may have done the cleanest and most detailed straight razor work that I've ever had. I look dapper."
"2","Recent family lunch at the Duck, outside under the amazing eucalyptus trees, had more great sandwiches.  It's so easy to get a really layered and yummy vegetarian sandwich with great side treats.  And the meat-a-tarians in the family loved their sandwiches too!"
"1","15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.\n\nThere are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again."
"1","I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!"
"2","Got a cough or a cold. Sniffles taking the best of you. This CVS location is more than your typical drug store. A drive thru pharmacy is located in the back. Along with a healthcare clinic to help you when in need. Stressful day at the job or need some pick me up there is a small liquor isle. Don't forget to pull out your CVS card to save more."
"2","Although this running store is not in the most convenient location for us, my husband and I would drive across town to get fitted for running shoes. We tried a few other places for fittings, but this place seemed to do the best job and have employees with the most expertise. \n\nWhen I first decided to try running, I went to a bigger store and ended up with shoes that were way too tight and just not a good fit. A few months later, I tried this place and was really pleased with how thorough they were. Your first running shoe fitting can be a little awkward (I don't really like people around my feet anyway), but they made it very comfortable and easy and I loved the shoes they recommended. I probably paid more than other more discounted places, but I would rather pay a little more for good foot health and a better running experience.\n\nOverall, a great place to be fitted for running shoes whether you're just starting out or have been running for a long time."
"1","I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10. \n\nAfter reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away."
"2","I don't know what they've done, but this place has SERIOUSLY improved their food over the past year. I was wary to try it again since the first time I went (yes, over a year ago) it was less-than mediocre. I live less than a mile away, was jonesing for indian food one day, and didn't want to drive far. I forced myself to go here and am now completely ecstatic that there's an indian food joint I can walk to, gorge myself, and roll my arse home. \n\nThe menu is standard, but somehow a little better because they offer dishes that have subtle differences. HMMM, let's see. I don't know if i'm going to describe this correctly:\n\nOkay, I'm a vegetarian - DON'T STOP READING THIS, DAMNIT! I know what good food is!\n\nStarting over - I'm a vegetarian, and I eat A LOT of indian food, and I have eaten at a lot of indian food places. I don't claim to be an indian foodie, but I do know that the vegetarian dishes have subtle differences so I think some places omit the dishes that are similar and just hope that people who come in order the thing that's closest to the thing they really wanted. There's one dish I always order - paneer (tikka) masala, that some places don't have so I order the closest thing to it, and of course I can't remember it right now but it's another paneer dish with a tomato base that's similar. The thing that's awesome about this place is that it has BOTH, as well as other dishes that other restaurants sometimes don't put on the menu. You know what I mean?\n\nWho cares if you know what I mean - FOUR STARS!"
"1","We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it is so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be \""chilly capsicum\"" instead of \""chilly chicken\"".  Worst dish!!! \n\nDon't ever order chilly chicken here."
"1","When you work with their physical therapist(pt) you spend most of your time with the physical therapy assistant. The time you do spend with the physical therapist is very hurried and the focus is on getting on to the next patient not your healing. Not having gone to a PT before I had no idea how terrible they were till I went to an amazing group. I went to Toca P.T. for 4 months after which I was still in pain but they released me and said \""do the exercise and that is all they can do.\"" \nAfter only 6 sessions with a great P.T. I am finally almost pain free.\nToca is in the business to make money not to provide great physical therapy.\nWish I could give them no Stars, and get my wasted time back."
"2","My ode to the Swizzle...\n\nYou would never think much of this place, looking at it from the outside, that's if you can even find it. It is tucked behind the drive through Starbucks. \n\nThe swizzle rocks! Flat out. \n\nIt is small and cozy. The drinks are stiff and cheap. The jukebox has great music to entertain yourself with. There is a pool table (which I have dominated). And no food. Yes..no food. This is a bar! And a dive at that. \n\nThey have the best women's bathroom (as voted by citysearch I believe).\n\nAll around, this place kept me sane for years and still does when I come back to visit. Be sure to speak with the regulars, as many of them have awesome stories.\n\nA true gem."
"2","Super cute dive bar with friendly staff and patrons.  Cheap drinks, darts and a jukebox are entertaining.  Loved it!"
"1","As someone who manages a bar, I generally keep an open mind going into a new place. That was quickly closed when the owner of the bar came absolutely unglued, using obscene language and profanities towards our group. After her tirade of foul language and threatening gestures she then told us to leave or she'd have us arrested. Mind you this is the woman who was threatening physical violence against us not 10 minutes before. If you'd like to be treated as a CUSTOMER, and not a whipping pole, I'd suggest ANY other bar. If you'd like to be treated like absolute garbage by a raging alcoholic, head on in.  The bar tenders were ok, but clearly not fast paced enough to handle our group of 12."
"1","Sign at Danny's: $29.99 Oil Change and car wash included\nReceipt in my pocket: Full service oil change $29.99\n                                        Car Wash upgrade       $3.00\n                                        8 Qts Synthetic oil          $36.50\n                                        Special BMW filter          $10.00\n                                        Air filter                             $24.99\n                                        Grand freakin total         $111.24\n\nExpression on my face :("
"1","DIRTY CAR EVEN AFTER MOST EXPENSIVE CARWASH. \n\nThis has happened to me three times there now. Each time, I get a car wash/oil change with the most expensive wash. Each time they leave my cup-holders, parts of windshield, and inside of doors/dash DIRTY... even though I reminded them that I would like them cleaned. This last time, it really looked like they just vacuumed my car. Also, they are really too expensive for what you get. They also get mad/rude if you don't upgrade to all the things they offer you. The sales guy at the beginning got grouchy with me and literally stopped talking to me as soon as I said, \""No thank you\"" to a filter change."
"1","Bad wash as usual and NO customer service. Now they expect you to do what they can do in 30 seconds (change my new license plate number in their system) - now the customer has to go online and do it. Convenient yes - but never going back!!! The good news is they get you in and out quickly, the bad news is the quality of the wash leaves little to be desired and they beat you up for everything from windshield repair to oil changes to details and so on. After many years, I have had enough!!!"
"2","I got the best, most thorough car wash at Danny's! Unlike some of the other chains, they did not try to high pressure me into upgrades. They dried out the door jams. And the windshield was streak free. I'll be back often."
"1","I went to Danny's this weekend to get an oil change and car wash and I paid for a VIP car wash.   After picking up my car I was disappointed that there was still dirt on my car floor.  I later noticed that money I had in my car for parking was missing.  I'm highly upset that I paid for these services, tipped the staff, and had my property stolen.  I've been going to Danny's on and off for years as they are close to my home but I will never frequent their establishment again."
"1","Very scary and shady vibe. As a woman, I will never come back here. A lot of standing around and staring at customers.  I felt extremely uncomfortable."
"1","Be sure to ask if your car is ready yet. They forget to announce it sometimes and leave you in the lobby waiting for Christmas."
"1","Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!\n\nIf I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple."
"1","Won't be back...these guys stole all my Change out of my console...generally you expect random coins in the cup holders to be taken...but they went into a closed console and stole an entire change holder...don't give these guys your business!!!"
"1","Very unprofessional and rude employees...I would not recommend coming here unless you want the most expensive car wash, an oil change, and your gas tank filled for $0.20/gallon more than Cobblestone Auto Spa. I politely cancelled my wash (due to the badgering for upgrades and oil change) and the woman did not remove the writing on my window, just wiped two streaks through it and made a few comments under her breath. They then asked me to park my truck across the street while I go inside and pay for the gas they pumped while we were talking, then I was asked to come find her outside and bring her the receipt. Even though this location is close it is far from convenient. ..two thumbs down."
"1","I am a regular here, and not because they do a good job either. I hate this place today. It's very slow so almost no staff. So my car has been setting for 10 minutes now with nobody in line."
"2","Be very specific up front if you need the interior glass cleaned and dashboard dusted. I've unfortunately driven away and not had a decent clean inside of the car. \nNice staff and hard workers! Be sure to tip the guys up front vacuuming and not just on the tail end... Think about it: which do you think is harder !? lol"
"1","I had a fairly decently clean car to begin with,   I brought my car for a few touch ups, my trunk the back shield,  and the grill for bugs, and dash/cup holder area.\n\nMy car was parked for 10 min before I asked when they would notify me it's was complete.  They had a system error, and refused to honor my groupon. I was advised to contact corporate.  After 20 min on hold the girl who answered indicated someone would call me back.  \n\nI asked about my car,  the agent went outside and then came back and indicated it was done. \n\nThe bugs were still all over the grill,  cup holders and dash hadn't been touched,  car was clearly not vacuumed,  neither was the trunk. The service agent immediately went to wiping off the bugs, as I became more and more upset about the poorly rendered car wash.  I went inside and asked for a refund.  A gentleman told me I was just upset because of the groupon. I continued to advise it was the half hearted car wash that had me upset.  To which he continued to rebuttal that I was just upset about the Groupon. \n\nAnother associate took me to the car to find our what was wrong.  I pointed out the various items and he indicated he would fix the situation.  I ended up waiting near the detailing crew, who didn't hide the use of profanity. They we're shouting insults to one another. Not the most professional display,  even for a car wash. \n\nEventually I got my car,  still not vacuumed thoroughly and left.  Safe to say after coming sporadically (as needed) fire 7 years,  I'm fine not coming back to Dannys with the hit and miss service and bad car washes"
"1","Really bad & slow service. Will not return."
"1","I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!"
"1","I went to this salon on a whim, as I was desperate to get a haircut and color before my scheduled trip. I called on a Friday, and they were able to get me in. I arrived for My appointment on time which was scheduled for 2:15, I didn't get called until 2:40. My stylist Rosie, was nice,  I explained to her what I wanted and we talked about several options on how to get there. Once we agreed on the hair color, I noticed that after she came back from mixing the color, her hands smelled like cigarette smoke. (I can't stand that smell). We talked, and she is very nice. However, I didn't like that she never once checked on me while I was sitting there with the color on my hair, until I started getting a tingling/burn feeling on my scalp.. I asked one of the other stylist if they could call her from the back. My hair looked great but the lightening in the salon isn't that great so I couldn't really see a difference in my shade. Once I got home I noticed that I a had a mess of a hair color. The top part (roots) were alot lighter than the bottom. I called to see if I could reschedule. I got an appointment scheduled for the following day, only for them to call me to tell me she had called in sick. So now I'm off on my scheduled trip looking like a skunk. Unless you are in a hurry or on a serious budget I wouldn't recommend this place."
"1","Oh jeez I hate it when spring roles around and the drive through starts to smell... If you go to the drive through, be ready to keep your windows up because the grease box in the back STINKS... ugh - going through in a convertible to satisfy my oreo blizzard jones was enough to ruin my appetite. \n\nService is OK except in two cases, which unfortunately happen often: 1) a crowd of people inside; or 2) some in front at the drive through ordering multiple items. \n\nTo be fair, all the ice cream items (why order anything else at DQ?) are fine, as good as any other DQ. But the outside stench at the drive through and slow service limit me to only two stars."
"1","Unfortunately the reason why this place  has gone down hill is because it's no longer what it used to be."
"2","Stellar! One of my favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix. Sunday Happy Hour is rock solid - $5 small plates (many) and half price wine. \n\nThe menu covers everything you could want - steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, veggies, etc... I have eaten a wide variety of items and have never been disappointed. \n\nYou should stop reading this and go there. Pony up to the bar and enjoy yourself."
"2","I have been a regular here with my husband for a long time and it never let's me down. The only down side is the price of food. Honestly I'd be still willing to pay because I love this place so much. We always get the filet and some sort of fish. You also can't go wrong with the roasted corn and sweet potato baked in the beautifully presented green chili. Love the beer and wine selection aswell."
"1","One star for the environment very laid back and classy. Food on the other hand was not quality that we expected. Enchiladas were over powered by cheese and too soggy, and runny eggs. The tenderloin we asked medium rare definitely no taste nor quality the taste of the raw meat was not pleasing. Cocktails were not up to par either. Although service was great one more star."
"1","Maybe it was the time of day (afternoon) but something was very off today. The cheese plate arrived long after the entrees, my companion's bacon wrapped scallops seemed uncooked and raw.   The chicken schnitzel was fine.   Good beer and wine selection.  Slow service."
"1","Mediocre pizza, HORRIBLE service.  We told the waiter that we were in a hurry and it still took 45 minutes to get the food.  We had two minutes to eat it and it was boring.  Then I got to argue with the waiter, so that was fun.  Go to the Parlor.  It's got better pizza and WAY better service."
"2","Well, I pretty much love NYPD Pizza. Calzones are my favorite. I've been ordering the Frank Sinatra with various fillings for years. Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion, it's better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...I prefer it a little crispier, pretty much always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple. Also get ranch with everything...I'm not huge on ranch but I would bathe in the ranch from NYPD Pizza. The cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal!"
"1","Not sure what is happening, but two visits and two messed up orders.  Both times it took them more than an hour and half to prepare our pizza.  The first time they apologized for the \""slow service\"" and the fessed up that they lost our order.  Six weeks latter - they DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AGAIN. Not only did they lose our order, but then when we got home they gave us the wrong salad order.  Their pizza is not good enough to justify this type of wait.  We will look for another pizza place that manages their orders better."
"1","I went to this store 4/10/2014 and was Daniel took very good care of me upgrading my phone.\nI went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone. My wife is handicapped and had to go to the bathroom, they told her to walk over to the McDonalds which is about 100 yards away.\nMy wife got pissed and so did I, after my wife left the store I approached  a female displeased with their flip additude. When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. \nOne female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.\nOf course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.\nI told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.\nI've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.\nOf course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.\nThe customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.\nIf I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.\nIf Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.\nIf I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.\nVerizon is going to have to do a lot of butt kissing to keep me with them when the 2 years is up."
"2","A friend from out of town wanted to eat there so a group of us went here last night. When we got there there was a table open and we were seated immediately but there was a line outside while we were eating. The food was very good, everyone liked it. It was not the best I have ever eaten but still very good. The portions were not large but enough I didn't leave hungry either. Service was reasonable but not great. Considering this is a fairly small place and it was extremely busy I cannot complain. Overall it was a good experiance and we left happy."
"1","Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. \n\nClue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting \""Food Network\"" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. \n\nThe minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  \n\nCut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.\n\nSeems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...\n\nDon't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had."
"1","Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!\n\nI joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? \nThe fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  \n\nThe house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   \n\nThe prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. \n\nWill definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction."
"1","I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game."
"1","I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal."
"2","We went to Scottsdale area for spring break last week, so I looked up restaurants on my \""Flavortown\"" app, that show where Guy has reviewed (Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives).  Found this and told hubby we had to try it out one night.\n\nWe got there at about 5:45 or so on a Monday or Tuesday night - figuring no wait. We were wrong. It was already full (small, only maybe 10-12 tables inside), so put name on the list.  We waited maybe 20 minutes or so.  Worth the wait.\n\nI got the pasta bolognese that they showed on the show. Delicious sauce with fresh, tender pasta.  Hubby and son got the chicken parm, their usual.  I was hoping hubby would try to osso buco so I could try that too, but oh well.  Daughter had fettucini alfredo. They liked their meals too.  They DO serve wine here now - so that must have changed since some of the past reviewers said it was BYOB.  We also had their fresh, homeade pink lemonade. LOVED it. Wow - fresh with some type of herb in it that was so good.\n\nGlad we made the trip here after the afternoon spring training baseball game. A bit pricy I guess - for 4 of us, with just one glass of wine, I think we made it out for just under $90.  Friendly staff and it's a well-oiled machine. They'll take good care of you."
"1","I don't understand why anyone likes this place.  I ordered the fresh pasta and found it heavy and tasteless.   It is also very expensive considering for what I paid here I can dine in much better places.  I find the Food Network sign on the outside a little tasteless also."
"2","This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!"
"2","this is a newer, cleaner location.\n\ntheir agua frescas are very good. get the cheese crisp! delicious simplicity!\n\nfree chips and salsa if you dine inside!"
"2","Came here for afternoon tea with friends.  If you are going to splurge on the tea, you might as well pay the extra 15 dollars for unlimited sparking wine.  Geoffrey the tea sommelier will refill it as much as he refills the tea.  My favorite tea by far was his blend of coconut jasmine.  Absolutely heavenly.  I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but by the time the dessert course rolls around, you will be plenty full.  The scones are the best, they are served with clotted cream, raspberry jam and lemon curd.  Simply decadent and heavenly.  The piano player adds a nice touch.  A nice change of pace from the original field trip.  You are paying a bit (there is an extra \""tea service\"" charge on top of gratuity and tax, but well worth it."
"1","You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed \""Ritz-Carlton\""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a \""ritz carlton\"" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations."
"2","Very expensive hotel, but very good service overall."
"2","A special place for me...\n\nA few years back in Seattle my fiance (then boyfriend) and I had some vouchers to McCormick's and went for our first anniversary in January and still had some left over so we went for Valentine's Day that February.  We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a \""snug\"" which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.\n\nThe food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.\n\nTheir happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to \""by the glass\"" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.\n\nAnother little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.\n\nI've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.  Eat, drink, repeat!"
"1","Blow it out. The party's over. This candle has flickered and the flame has gone out. Wax on. Wax off. Closed. And for anyone who caught my stand up, yes indeed, I have purchased tapered candles here."
"2","When I first moved to Phoenix, I was walking around the Esplanade and saw this place.  I had lived in NYC for years and had lived on Mercer street where there was a \""Merc Bar\"" so thought I would go in and see if there was any connection.  Sure enough, this place is the 2nd location of the NYC Merc Bar.  Since I live across the street I come here fairly regularly.  I'm usually a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.  To their credit, their three beer tap usually has both Stella and Guinness, two of my favorites.  Nonetheless, I still have not found a wine there that I really love.  Not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.  And the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.  If you are on a date, the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you don't want to deal with the bar scene."
"1","Beautiful place, nice ambiance. Ok drinks. Music could be better. The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over! \n\nIf this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable. \n\nAlso,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!\n\nAlso, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \\ \n\nAll in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue. \n\nAs for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.\n\nSorry Merc."
"2","The food at this CPK is pretty good.  I guess you could say that for any of the CPKs, but they always do a nice job at this location and are very accommodating of any special requests.  I realize for the relatively low price you pay, you're not getting top-of-the-line cuisine, but it's a great for what it's intended.\n\nThe one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent.\n\nThe service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant."
"2","We had to stop by the Apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to CPK for lunch. It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea.\n\nWe got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did. \n\nThe manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one. \n\nThe server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways. My boyfriend and I both said this was one of the best service we had received from any restaurant in a long time. As we left my boyfriend mad a point to tell the manager how great the service was."
"2","I am not sure about the other services. But there is a hidden gem here. Lucy is an aesthetician. I strictly go to her for all of my brow waxing. My brows are a challenge and most have royally screwed them up. My brows should be the test for beauty schools. Lucy is seriously the brow whisperer. Go to her for your wax needs-- she is in a class all her own. This is the only reason why I give them 5 stars. Also the front desk service is always attentive and super nice."
"1","I took my Bassett hound in on Wednesday 11/7/12 she has something wrong with her left eye looked greyish. They did no testing and gave her drops for possibly being bitten, by Saturday morning the eye was almost completely grey and I took her back the doctor came in didn't even look into her eyes and said it has to be Valley Fever and needed to do blood work but started treatment on Saturday and would call when the results came in. She acted like I was wasting her time by asking questions about Valley Fever. I just moved to Arizona and had never heard of it. So we did blood work and more medicine and off we go. By Tuesday afternoon I get the call saying quit giving her the pills for Valley Fever and take her to the Eye dr for animals it must be glaucoma and they can't help. So, after $300.00 with them and another $300.00 for the eye dr YES she does have glaucoma and is blind in the eye  I believe they possibly could have saved her sight if she had been diagnosis properly"
"2","Ate here for dinner during the week while staying at the hotel.\nFor an appetizer had house made potato chips with bleu cheese.  Waiter said the bleu cheese was also house made.  Seemed rather incredible but it was really good.\nFor my entree I had a filet cooked medium with the same bleu cheese on top.  One of the best steaks I have ever had.  Up there with the top half dozen, at least.  I travel and eat a lot of steaks, so this is saying something.  Had a loaded baked potato on the side. \nService was fine.  Attentive, knowledgeable.  No complaints.\nAmbiance was fine for a hotel restaurant."
"2","In today's economy where most businesses try to provide the least and charge the most, I feel that it is necessary to give credit where credit is due.  Thus, I'd like to give a shout out to Hyde Park Jewelers in Phoenix, and specifically, Quinton V, one of their sales associates.  Quinton made the engagement ring and wedding band purchasing process extremely easy and very low pressure.  He is very well informed and was great at teaching me all about diamonds.  He spent an hour with me the first time I walked in the store and never pressured me into buying anything or spending more than I wanted.  I ended up with the perfect engagement ring.  Fast forward five months and we went back into the store to buy bands.  Again, Quinton was very easy to work with, put us both at ease, and provided us with several options that fit our budget.  We walked out less than an hour later with the perfect band as well.  I appreciate businesses that go the extra mile to make sure that customers are happy with their purchasing decisions and take the time to inform them without pressuring them during the process.  If you are looking for a quality jewelery store without the high pressure sales environment, go to Hyde Park and ask for Quinton.  You won't be disappointed."
"2","A friend of mine referred me to Dr. Zeman and I'm SO happy she did. I had this knee scoped back in 06 from another ortho doc in town and it was horrible. This experience is how it should be! I wished I would of known Dr. Zeman back then. I probably wouldn't be in this situation again if I had!  Dr. Zeman scoped my knee  Nov 2, 2011 and removed a 2 cm cyst and cleaned up the meniscus. I can't tell you how happy I am with not only Dr. Zeman but also his entire staff. I feel like I'm in really good hands and I know I am getting the best care possible. They actually really do care!"
"1","\""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?\""\n\n\""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.\""\n\n'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \""saved\"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \""Why don't you like caraway?\"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \""I really don't like the taste.\"" When she asked me \""Why?\"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \""sauce\"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \""real\"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese."
"1","Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."
"2","Amazing sandwiches and probably the best servers/staff of any restaurant I've been to. Great choices and gourmet sandwiches available that comes with a handful of sides and a pickle. Condiments on every table and a tray of free water at the end of the counter. All smiles around. Such a great place. I can complain about the price but I just keep coming back anyway! It's that good!"
"1","Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. \n\nRight off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. \n\nI ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \n\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."
"1","Food is average at best.  But last two times the service was terrible.  They need to retrain their servers in customer service.  The only reason for the 2 stars is that there is no denying that their cheesecake is excellent."
"2","Ordered burgers from there tonight just to get something different for a change, amazing meat cooked as per ordered,great service, I have to say they di burgers as good as anyone else if not better! Kobe and chop house!!"
"2","I do love cheesecake!  Those two words should not be combined to create a word to describe such deliciousness...but I will not allow such transgressions to distract from my indulgences!  The CF does such an excellent job...I should have ordered two to go.  The red velvet is superb...I'm now wearing it permanently on bum.  Yes...once on my lips and bam...there it is!!"
"1","Tonight my fianc\u00e9 and I took my parents to Cheesecake Factory to catch up over a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee (it was 5:30PM) We got our coffees right away, but had to ask for water twice. After about 30 minutes we had asked for our check and a box from our waitress. 20-25 minutes went by and we asked again, she said \""I'll be right back.\"" Another 20 minutes goes by and we tracked down the manager. He apologized and said he would have the check right out to us. At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip. Never going back to this Cheesecake Factory again. Also, we never got our boxes for our leftover cheesecake."
"2","I was just hungry. I ordered the Cajun chicken lil bits. They were not little and the portion size was unbelievable. I can put away some good and there was plenty left for a good lunch. \n\nGotta love the portion sizes! Bartender was cool as well"
"1","This place is not there anymore."
"1","Thank you for all the emails you sent me on my review! I was surprised at how many responses I recieved from people searching for the right dentist..\nI shared my new dentist information and even got some movie tickets from my dentist for the referrals!\nI find it funny how since I wrote this review how many people have reviewed with 5 stars... They must have a lot of friends and family! \nI hope everyone reads my review and picks the right dentist for your needs!\nHappy Holidays"
"1","Went to the one near cave creek. I had the bacon chicken fajitas. I GOT FOOD POISONING !! BE CAREFULLLLLL :/ I have always been coming here, but for now I'll be taking a break from here !!"
"1","I mispronouced something on the menu and I got an entire lecture about it complete with the mocking laugh. Sad cause i could have actually liked this place. \n\nWord of advice: get rid of all the gimicky advertisements including the sign for the casino. Make it into a french cafe NOT a billboard in Times Square."
"1","These people are horrible and rude. The macaroon and tiramisu that I got from them were so stale, they smelled like the fridge they were kept in. The macaroon was so old and crunchy that I spit it out. One bite of the tiramisu and I threw it out. Don't waste your money at this place. $12 for two very gross pastries."
"1","overpriced and grocery carts are in the parking lot if you need one. I prefer a Sprouts, Safeway, or Frys."
"1","During my 5 nights stay at Ritz,  I went to  Bistro 24 for breakfast my first morning.  I experienced very slow service for Ritz standards.  I had to wait a while for someone to wait on.  It was not even busy.  For the next 4 days, I just walked across the street to Starbucks."
"2","Always a god choice. Last time I was there I got the steak tar tar and it was fabulous! The only downfall is that they have no beers on draft and not too many in bottles either, but they have really good cocktails. Good, fun place for a date but I usually go with my dad and just sit at the bar. The bar is also a god place to have a business meeting. They have my favorite little candies everywhere."
"2","Really a nice little find. Four stars for the gyro dinner, veggie plate and greek salad. They were all really good and the price is definitely right. i will definitely be back here again!"
"2","Maybe it was a matinee viewing of \""Get Him To the Greek\"" last weekend. No matter how it happened, I have been all about Greek food the last few days. Following up my delicious gyro feta on Tuesday, I decided to try out Cyprus Grill, right around the corner from my stomping grounds. The place is right next to Trader Joe's, so I am not sure how I missed it before tonight. Walking in, Cyprus has a smallish set-up with hardwood floors and some outside seating (with misters, thankfully). \n\nI was immediately greeted by the hostess/cashier/etc with a huge smile, which always lets me know I made a good choice. With all of the complaints about customer service on Yelp, I would think more restaurants would train their staff right, and Cyprus certainly has do so. From an earlier Yelp review, I knew exactly what I wanted: the Spartan Club (a pita sandwich with grilled chicken, gyro meat, lettuce, tzatziki, feta, and hot sauce) with greek fries. My new friend offered an upsize in fries, but they were bad enough as a side, so I was fine with the normal order. After about 8-10 minutes, I was on my way.\n\nSimply put, the sandwich is fantastic. I love pita bread, and this was soft and tasty, but strong enough so it wasn't breaking with the weight of the sandwich. The chicken was excellent, if not overcooked just a touch, and the gyro meat was as good as any I have had. The tzatziti sauce was lighter than I like, but it and the feta certainly added to the meal. The one issue I had with the sandwich was my own fault. The hot sauce seemed like a strange addition for it, and even though it added a little bite, it eventually overcame the Spartan. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, but I would probably go without the hot sauce next time.\n\nThe Greek fries were fantastic as well. Sometimes with Greek fries, the lemon overcomes the rest of the meal, but it was a perfect compliment to the melted feta and seasoning.\n\nAll in all, another great Greek meal and well worth the solid price you pay for it."
"1","Unfortunately this is the place I picked out for our Valentines Day dinner...I had to take ALL the blame....\n\nGetting ready was fun, I heard it was a little more upscale being located in the Biltmore area.  So we put on our new clothes, smellin good, lookin good and exchanged gifts...Now we were off to eat!\n\nI first made reservations for 8:30, however, they called me a couple of days prior to ask if I'd move to 8 (no biggie) because they were having an afterparty at 10 (lame).  When we arrived at 7:45 we still had to wait in the bar until 8:30 (lame again).  The place (at least bar area..never saw the actual restaurant) was very pretty and dimly lit.  I liked it alot.  We ordered one well vodka martini and and Knob Hill and coke that came to $18.00.  We finished our drinks and waited about another 10 minutes to be seated...Seated where??? Literally 3 feet behind where we we standing in the bar.  Yep! Our \""table\"" was (and Im NOT joking) about 15 feet from the front door, 10 feet from the hostess stand, and IN the WAITING LOUNGE.  So like I said, we never saw the restaurant.  Since the door kept opening from customers coming in I was ABSOLUTELY freezing..So cold I had to wear my heavy peacoat during dinner (lame x3) and my husband was actually freezing cold too, which never happens.  So much for my new, sexy Valentines outfit...\n\nWe ordered our meal but the waiter messed up and gave the table (who sat 15-20 minutes after us) our second course.  We had to wait 35 minutes between our salad and our appetizer; and of course our entree came within 30 seconds of our app....\n\nAnyway, long story not short,  the bill with tip came to $140 and obviously included a wasted and crappy time...The food wasn't too bad, but will NEVER go again and let people know it's NOT worth it!!!\n\np.s. your catfish nuggets were cold too ;)"
"1","Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd.  Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here!  I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill.  The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting!  Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School.\n\nAlso, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up.  Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me.  I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back."
"1","I purchased the Living Social deal for 6 pedicures- it was a great deal. \nI realized right away that it would be difficult to complete the deal as they get booked up 3 weeks in advance, and the deal expires 6 months after it was purchased. The biggest issue is that they have VERY limited appointments available after 4pm. Most women work for a living and don't even get off work before this time. How can you expect to satisfy the public if you aren't even available when the majority of people are off work??\nI must say the pedicure experience itself was amazing. The owner did my service and she is the nicest woman and she did great. She explained to me everything that was going on and we chatted for the entire 2 hour experience. Even better is how clean they are and they use plastic inside the basin so you are never using the same tub as someone else. \nI had to cancel my second appointment the day of because something came up so unfortunately I lost one of my visits- fair enough it does say that in the voucher. However I really wanted to reschedule for as soon as possible. Next available appointment- a FULL 3 WEEKS LATER. Seriously?! Keep the $70. No point in a good service if you can never get in to take advantage of it. \n\nIt's a shame because this is a place I would love to frequent."
"1","Happy hour prices seemed decent, but the selections I tried (spicy tuna roll and salmon roll) were lackluster in taste and quality.  I do have to recommend the soft-shelled crab appetizer... oh my!  \n\nWhile the prices beg for another try, it's going to be awhile till I visit again- so many restaurants to try first!  \n\nIf you want great sushi, try Sakana on Elliot and I-10, or Old Town Scottsdale's Kyoto.  I definitely am not a fan of Ra."
"1","Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.\n\nSo after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.\n\nBoy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.  \n\nA couple of the rolls we ordered:\n\nViva Vegas Roll\nCaterpillar Roll\n\nThe service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.\n\nThe rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.\n\nThe Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.  \n\nAgain, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here..."
"1","Thank the good lord they are closing!  The fact that this place lasted so long is a testament to the fact that people will eat just about anything...\nLenny is the king of schlock food!"
"1","Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible."
"2","Soooooo good! Decided to give this place a try and oh my it was a great decision. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is cute yet professional and the coffee is DELICIOUS. The cups are right by saying CAUTION: Contents are deliciously addictive. I'm addicted!! (My fav is the frozen java with vanilla syrup, yummy!)"
"1","Tried this place for lunch since I drive past it near my new place. It was bad.. I had the fried chicken and it was pink. Rest was greasy and didn't taste good. 2 stars for how cheap it was but this place was full of large people who don't know good Chinese and this wasn't good."
"1","This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!"
"2","I went here last a year and a half ago and enjoyed the food.  Definitely would go back if in the near vicinity & in the mood for Cajun food."
"1","Maybe it was an off day or something for this place..  Stopped in for lunch today, it's a Saturday.  Place is in a strip mall.  Decorations are something you would see in party city around Mardi Gras time, (pretty cheesy).  Service was nice and friendly.  Now lets get down to the food part of this.  \nI'm very hesitate to say but I must, it wasn't good.. Yes I've read the other reviews but I've been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I don't think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldn't taste any spice at all on anything.  Food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile.\nMy husband and I ordered the Boudin Balls for an app.  Now those were decent.  I ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Po'boy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half., sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish, it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Po'boy, it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips, ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them.\nI felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his, first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage, it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.  \nSo yeah.. not sure if it's what we ordered or what, but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley.\nP.S.  My husband ordered Tea, it's wasn't Louisiana Tea, nor sweet as they make it in the south... would have been nice to have been given the option for sweet tea!"
"1","I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back."
"1","nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."
"1","Rude customer service on the phone-like you are doing me a favor even answering my questions regarding bringing my vacuum in for repair=I am going somewhere else."
"2","This is more of appreciation than an actual review.\nAs a former long time Az state employee health care was extremely frustrating. Now in retirement my medicare supplement is not an improvement. Same carrier, different plan. To find a provider, conservatively speaking, is close to impossible, due to the extremely low provider payments and the fact that the provider listings, year after year are a sad joke.Call ten places from the directory and most are not contracted or wrong address or have not been provider for years. A heart specialist was listed as under water specialist? For my needed cataract surgery I spent dozens of hours on the phone with\ncarrier who promises to call back and never does.\nVery nice and courteous and caring completely inept\npeople. After a month I gave up on my carrier and spoke to a number of offices unrelated to cataracts.\nAs usual Hatfield Family Medicine (Concentra)\nwas more than nice and caring. I left their office\nhaving an appointment at Barnet, Dulaney, Perkins\nwho are highly competent but one of possibly two firms who will accept my carrier's measly payment.\nHatfield continued to work on what they had no need to do in the first place and mailed me info on another doctor they believe will accept my plan.\nIn a few days I will finally be seen after three months of wasted time. I have to think it is generosity on the part of Barnet, Dulaney Perkins.\nA review will follow."
"1","Do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money. This was the worst auto repair experience I've had and if I never have another experience like this one, it would still be too soon for me."
"1","Wide selection and ok prices. I've been waiting for the last 2 hours to pick up my rental equipment. No obvious system to help service people."
"1","Is it possible to give \""zero\"" stars?\n\nI've been in there twice and the employees were rude, both times.  I'm not the \""Scottsdale Elite\"", but seriously... I'm a paying customer too.  The little boy who said he was the manager was rude too."
"1","I travel a good deal.  This is the worst hotel experience, by far.\n\nThis is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.\n\nI should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.\n\nWith a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved \""clean\"" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.\n\nIf the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again."
"1","It's almost comical how bad this place is. It's all been said before me, but here's just some of what makes this a horrible place to stay. \n\n1) no AC. I came in January so no REAL need for it except that both rooms I had were set to 80 degrees at check in and it took forever to cool down with the warm air just circulating. \n\n2) absolutely and completely filthy. There were crumbs on the furniture and rando hairs all over the bathroom in both rooms I tried. 2nd room smelled like 20 years of smoking have been going on. \n\n3) The phones in my 2nd room didn't work very well and when I finally got to my messages it was just a sales pitch from Embassy Suites. \n\n4) elevators are unbelievably slow. Prepare to wait. \n\n5) fridge in my first room was so loud I could hear it in the bedroom with the door closed and tv on. \n\n6) stupid \""automatic\"" deadbolts. When I'm staying in a 3rd world hotel like this I'd really like the satisfying click of an actual deadbolt to let me know the door is secure. \n\nIn summation, this place is just awful."
"2","Kinda dumpy, and not entirely in an endearing, it's-an-almost-hundred-year-old-place kinda way.  Service was ok-ish, music terrible (live music Friday nights - not a fan myself).  This place gets 4 stars for the food.  Burger and fries.  Epic win.  Burger with bacon, dried apples (??? I know, right?!) and a huge gob of blue cheese on an english muffin.  Fries were awesome, too, served with a giant cuppa ketchup.  Burger was slightly overdone, unsure whether there was ordering confusion or what happened (I shared the burger w/ a friend, we both agreed it was awesome despite unfortunate well-doneness).  I liked my drink, I paid 15.50 for two of em which is a pretty good deal.  \n\nAll-in-all, a surprisingly accessible yet highly unique place - offbeat.  Seems like it needs a look at the details - a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.  I'm totally coming back here when I need a place with character.  I'm psyched about getting the food here again, too."
"2","I thought this place rocked.\n\nWe made dinner reservations for a Friday night for a table with a view.\nWe were in the inside portion of the mansion with a large party.\n\nThe food was great, views were great, drinks were great.\nMy favorite part was being handed a glass of sparkling wine as we entered.  Yay!\n\nAfter dinner we explored the house.  Then we moved to the lounge and found a very, very entertaining and maybe drunk lounge singer (think of the band at the end of the Hangover movie)\n\nI would definitely return for a fancy brunch or special night out."
"1","It's a bad feeling when you walk away from a restaurant feeling that you've been ripped off. It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth.\n\nMy wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal -- so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the \""deal\"" that we went in with . . .  wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth $120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at $120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax.\n\nWhat did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item -- two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute. \n\nWe ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly $120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet.  That was our \""voucher deal\"" price. That's absurd . . . the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for $18-24. The cup of soup perhaps $5-7 and the microscopic \""tasting\"" of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few $$. How does this equate to what we paid?\n\nWhile the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment -- seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix. (The night before we spent $50 at St. Francis and it was incredible)."
"1","Great location.  Great views.  Interesting Facility.  VERY marginal food.\nWe went there for my wife's birthday as someone bought us a gift certificate.  \nOur server was great.  He was a great blend of courteous, professional, conversational. \nBut the food was poor at best.  My wife's salad included old, rotted lettuce. The entrees were really second rate.  \nWe will not be going back!"
"2","FABULOSO............ The ambiance, the wine list, the cuisine, the service, the views, the romance..... WOW!!!!!!!!! Mere words cannot describe this magical wedding anniversary dinner we had....."
"1","Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \""that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\"" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \""that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\"""
"2","An initial good sign of any business is proper, friendly and enthusiastic phone answering skills. Budget delivered. Another good sign is the person pronouncing your name correctly. \""Yes Thomas how can I help you?\""...as oppossed to \""Yes Tom how cany I help you?\"" I totally don't care you called me Tom, hell, you can call me Nancy Drew for all I care, but it shows you are LISTENING! A lost skill, don't ya think? I gave Joe my request. Which was pretty unique. I needed decals applied to a tinted window on my patio. Something to spice it up. We tried ourselves and those little decals bubbled more than a flapjack on a hot griddle in Atlanta in Julyyyy! I've never been to Atlanta or referred to pancakes as flapjacks. Something I just channeled so it seems. The work, by Jeremy was excellent. The follow up by Joe and his wife, visiting my establishment was unsurpassed. And greatly appreciated. So look for the good signs in any company. Politeness. Good work. Follow through. It happened to me. It will happen to you with Budget Signs."
"1","Very unprofessional and rude. Acted like he was doing me a favor to replace a water heater. Had enough and got someone else to do the job. As a small business owner, I know if I treated my clients like this, I would have no clients."
"2","Great, as usual. Am glad the pricing has remained affordable.\n\nFor those who do not know, this is a non-profit organization, even though it is sponsored/hosted by Harkins theaters.\n\nEvery year I try to see some shorts, as well as 1 feature film."
"1","This location certainly draws a large lunch crowd.  I was there with my son yesterday at about 12:30 and the place was packed.  The staff seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with everything. For instance, there were about 6 plates...more than we needed.  I did see some setting to the side that had leftover food residue from the last guest sitting to the side...I'm not counting those.  Anyhow, behind my son and I was a group of 6, so we weren't all eating right away!  I have been to this location in the past and there were no napkins at all - they used papertowels from the bathroom.  You pulled off what you needed and went with it.  Yikes!  Where is management when you need them?\nFood quality was good.  Veggies were fresh, some of the quantities pretty skimpy.  I understand it was lunch time.\nIt seemed there were 2 servers only, and they were hustling. More were certainly needed.\nOverall, it's a good place to go.  I do enjoy meeting a friend of mine here on an occaisional Sunday afternoon when it's much calmer...altho that's when we had the paper towels issue...but, service is friendly, food is pretty good.\nOh...and yesterday, the best soup...Chicken Enchilada Soup...if it's there the day you go...you have to get this!"
"2","\""restaurant of distinction\"": right off the bat, the expectations are high.  when you're arrogant enough to put something like that in your title, you're awesome in my book.  it's like calling myself \""todd 'the man' o.\"" maybe i will change my name to that to put myself in a comparable position to that of avanti.\n\nonto lunch...started off with some of their house garlic bread.  if i didn't have a flight to catch right after, i probably would have eaten more, but decided to be nice and spare my fellow row mates.\n\nwent on to my main dish: linguine with white clam sauce ($16).  quite possibly one of the most amazing pasta dishes i've had in a long time.  the sauce had a bunch of clams, which i can always appreciate.  if it wasn't a \""restaurant of distinction,\"" i may have started to lick the plate after my linguine was gone.\n\nconcluded the meal by sharing the homemade tiramisu ($6) with my 2 colleagues.  for the price, i've had better."
"2","Wonderful place with great food. The place could use some updating but I still like it."
"1","What era is this?\n\nThat was my first thought as I stepped into this restaurant.  Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \""Scarface.\""  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. \n\nI came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   \n\nThe menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. \n\nFor starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. \n\nWe all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)\n\nFor my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. \n\nA few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.\n\nDessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. \n\nIn my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check."
"2","I had written my original review after the first time I went here.  Since then, I have probably been about 20 more times.  This place is totally a 5 star, bombastic breakfast diner.  The waitress is amazingly quick and on top of things.  I really appreciate that attentiveness in the morning.  The kitchen kicks out food just as quickly and it sure is good.  I've tried the sausage and eggs (which is a giant polish sausage that has been grilled) and \""The Bus\"" (which is a huge piece of ham).  The food is always great and the bill is always under $20 for both of us.  This is our fallback for breakfast now.  No more Denny's or IHOP - ALWAYS JERRY'S.  We even went Christmas morning while waiting for the family to wake up.  This place is top notch."
"1","Can you say SYSCO?\n\nAlmost nothing served at this restaurant is made in house. If I want plastic wrapped pre-fab food, I can buy it at Costco.\n\nThe only thing made in house the night we visited was the Meatloaf. It was mediocre.\nWe won't return unless my wife gets a high powered hankering for chocolate cake."
"2","This is a great place to go in the morning or late at night after partying.  I will forever enjoy going to this place because it reminds me of truck stop food while traveling.  The hungry traveller will always fill you up with bottomless pancakes but the country fried steak is also something I always get.  It gets 4 stars because sometimes they are understaffed and takes a bit to get service.  But when I go, I'm usually not in a hurry anyways.  The staff is always friendly day or night. Even a simple side salad is fresh and deserving of props.  The awesome thing is the fresh desserts and pie will satisfy any drunk or Sunday camper.  If you're tired of the usual IHOP or hole in the wall breakfast place, enjoy the old school diner atmosphere that th\nis place has to offer."
"1","My wife took me to Steamers for my birthday this summer.  We were both let down that we weren't going to be able to take our annual vacation to Maine to see her Dad and eat lots of yummy fresh seafood.  We love lobster bisque, lobster rolls, baked stuffed lobster, and just about lobster anything.  Oh yeah, and baked stuffed shrimp too.\n\nSo this was supposed to be our \""mini-getaway\"" since we were homebound for the summer.  We were both a little let down to be honest.  She chose Steamers because their online menu said they had lobster bisque.  Well, we got to the restaurant and they didn't have lobster bisque.  I had the special, swordfish au poivre, and it was good, but very rich, and wasn't feeling very well a few hours later.  The wine list wasn't as extensive and one would expect for a nice seafood restaurant in Phoenix.  I have to say that in general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special, but it was very expensive. We agreed that next time we wanted a good bowl of bisque we'd go next door to the Capital Grille"
"2","The closest touristy, Arizona-esque candy shop to me here in Central Phoenix.\n\nCactus Candy Co is located in a small building room, stocked with: hot sauces, jellies, marmalades, cactus gummies, prickly pear taffy and shirts. Upon entering I was greeted and was given some advice on the popular items people typically purchase. It was helpful, good amount of candies and jellies but definitely limited. Two thumbs up for having a discount with paying with cash + being a student. With the discount it ended up not being too expensive either. \n\nI got a few boxes of prickly pear candies, taffy and jelly for my friends and family back home. Crossing my fingers they'll enjoy the distinct taste of prickly pear from the good ol' Valley of the Sun!"
"2","These guys are always fair,  have the best work ethic and never have a problem explaining everything in detail. They use the old-school weights, analog solution to an analog problem. No computers, and its dead on every time."
"1","After all the good reviews I have to say I was disappointed. Anything fried was overdone, and the chicken and veggie dish was overpriced and bland. The customer service was great, but the food was expensive and sub-par."
"1","Not really that impressed with this place. I ordered a large pizza and some cherry chipotle BBQ wings.\n\nThe wings were disappointing - the sauce, which I was hoping would at least be interesting, was pretty bland, and the meat didn't have much flavor.\n\nThey forgot to cut the pizza, which was kind of annoying. I tried a few toppings, half sausage and roasted red peppers, and half ham and olives. The sausage was pretty much just sliced hot dogs, and the rest of the toppings were not noteworthy. The rest of the pizza was equally not noteworthy.\n\nOverall, just overpriced and not that great."
"2","I've always loved Williams-Sonoma!  It is more than a kitchen store; it is an experience! A great place to buy presents!\n\nYes, you can just go in there and buy whatever you need for your gourmet kitchen, or a unique gift for your best friend or your mother. But WS staff is there for more than just to sell you high end kitchen delights. They will teach you how to use your new purchases and the many options that are available that you had no idea you wanted or even needed.\n\nThe staff is well-trained, not your usual retail sales clerks, but men and women who know their inventory and how it can make a difference in your cooking life and they aren't afraid to tell you.\n\nThe WS staff at the Biltmore are on the top end of the sales scale. They are there to teach you what they have in the store, what you might need to fulfill your every kitchen desire and what you cannot live without. Yep, I challenge you to get out of there without buying at least one thing, or learning how to cook something you didn't even know you wanted.  Williams-Sonoma is a playground for cooks of all levels. And, if you are like me and not a chef . . .it is a great place to buy wedding and Holiday presents."
"2","Reasonably priced tailor shop when you need alterations done quickly. Apparently, they can also make custom suits, but my experiences have been with having pants hemmed, waistbands taken both in and out, and having jacket sleeves lengthened.\n\nGenerally, your work will be done in a week or less. There are a number of people working here, so you get whoever is free but I've been happy with everyone I've had. \n\nOne thing I somewhat dislike is that even thought they do have changing rooms, they will often do simple alterations without having you try on the item. Luckily, the estimates have, so far, been right on the money.\n\nOh, and its cash only, so hit an ATM before you go."
"2","02.05.10-02.08.10\n\nWe paid $150 + $5/day parking for our entire stay.  After reading the other Yelp reviews, I was really afraid of getting jumped (or worse).  But low expectations sometimes are good.\n\nWe checked in Friday night; they had no problem switching our king sized bed to a double bed suite.  The suite has a mini fridge and a microwave.  Definitely necessary after long nights of partying.  We are two doors down from the gym.  There are two flat screens.  Definitely better than expected.\n\nFree made-to-order breakfast every morning.  Weekdays until 9:30, weekends until 10:00.  French toast, omelets, hash browns, etc.  It's pretty awesome if you can actually wake up for it.  The chefs actually come over to the tables to check up on how you're doing.  \n\nThe pool/hot tub is open from 6:00 a.m. to midnight.  Also amazing after a long day of hiking, or shopping, whatever floats your boat.\n\nRecommend!"
"1","ewww.  didn't like this place.  the neighborhood was iffy and i was scared to leave the hotel after dark.  the room was dated but clean.  won't be back."
"2","I had bought an alarm system from somewhere else and came to these guys to get it installed.  Not only were they polite, but they were very fast!  Everything is working great and have yet to have a problem.  I would definitely go back again, and yes, I found these guys due to the reviews already yelp."
"2","I don't live in Phoenix, but I was planning a surprise baby shower IN Phoenix, so I turned to Yelp to find the best-tasting cakes in the area. Barb had the highest reviews, so I placed an order for a custom cake. Total cost was about $70 (which I was to pay when I picked up). We ordered a 1/2 sheet cake (chocolate) with strawberry filling and butter cream frosting. We had this special detail (a baby blanket) on top which cost an extra $20, but judging by the picture would be well worth it because it looked so cute.\n\nWhen I went to pick it up, I asked for a red velvet cupcake because I had read they had the best red velvet cupcakes anywhere. \n\nThe only reason I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because of that cupcake -- it wasn't fresh or moist. The icing was delicious, but I didn't love the cupcake. \n\nBut the cake for the shower -- O. M. G. People were going absolutely nuts over this cake. It was hands-down, the BEST cake I've ever eaten at ANY kind of party or celebration, EVER. Moist, fresh, tasty, gorgeous, delicious. Five stars for that cake, for sure. \n\nSo I would definitely custom-order a fresh cake and not pick a cupcake out of the case. :-) The people there were all VERY helpful and friendly - the guy even carried the cake out to my car."
"2","OH MAN!! I am seriously addicted to their Pink Champaigne Petit Fours (TO DIE FOR!!!), and their frosted sugar cookies are a big hit around the office! I haven't gotten anything here that hasn't been fantastic! One of the best tiramasus I've had in a long time, and their cupcakes rival Sprinkles all day long!\n\nAlong with the delicious treats and beverages comes generally GREAT customer service, the gentlemen that work in the afternoon are super friendly and helpful! I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \""Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\"" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!! Although, I would encourage all my sweet toothed brethren out there to not go Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, so as to avoid the cracken, she's just awful! Bon Apetit!!"
"1","It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. \n\nI've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. \n\nOur food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more \""juice\"" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. \n\nI've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)"
"1","Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!"
"1","WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example."
"2","The Dogg says. Muy bien Manuel's.  It's the Sonoran style type of comida Mexicano that is prevalent in AZ.   My taco was full of shredded beef and had good flavor. It was also stuffed full of lettuce tomato onions and cheese. My tostada was very crispy the beans tasted homemade and was one of the best tostadas I've ever had. Manuel's has one of the most tastiest salsas in the state. You can actually get full eating just chips and salsa with a beer and use your dinner as a partial appetizer and lunch for the next day. I miss the 32nd St. and Indian school location! But this one on 28th street has also been very good. Great service. Good food for the money. Get your taste buds over there and check out a great standard Mexican food restaurant!!!"
"1","Horrible service. I bought a $400 belt for a buddy of mine for his birthday and he went the next day to get a bigger size, never wore it or even really touched it. They told him they couldn't exchange it because it seemed a bit bent like if it was worn.\n\nMoreover, the customer \""service\"" salesperson brought the belt into the back room and came back with an obvious new hole in the belt. She said that we did it, even though they gift wrap the box and we didn't even touch it after buying it and it was brought back the same day!\n\nDespicable store. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Blatant fraudsters won't even give you any service. I will not let this go lightly."
"1","Hey Gabi M. wish we could agree. On our recent visit there, it became such a comedy of errors that they actually comp'd the entire meal.\n\nA+ for design and architecture, nobody appreciates a fine terrazzo in the bathroom like we do, but D+ for food and service. \n\nHaving said that, it is Hillstone (Houston's) and the one thing they are best known for is their impeccable consistency. \n\nWe are more than confident that they will pull it together in short order and continue to succeed in their real business -- printing money."
"2","This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. \n\nIf you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why? \n\n-Wonderful outside \""first come first served\"" patio seating with fireplaces \n-Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area \n-A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). \n-No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. \n-Great service.\n\nWhat hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.\n\nOverall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here."
"1","We had dinner at Hillstone a couple nights ago.  The food was, for the most part, pretty good.  However, the service was below average.  They really need to work on training their servers better or they will lose a lot of potential repeat business.   We showed up at 7:30 and our reservation was for 8pm.  We seated ourselves on the outdoor patio (which was very nice as far as scenery/ambience).  It was awhile before a server came over to take our drink orders; we saw her go by/near tables next to us twice before she finally came over.  She made us feel rushed from the get-go; as if she was in a hurry -- it was a little strange for the relaxed atmosphere and mode we were in.  She brought us our drinks - never offered water - and when she didn't come back for awhile, my husband got up to get me water from the bar.  She soon brought a check over and we at that point said we'd like to order an appetizer.  Again, she seemed a little \""put out\"" by us, but took the order.  When we were halfway through our spinach dip, at about 7:50, a hostess came over and moved us indoors to our table that was \""ready.\"". It would have been much nicer to finish the appetizer where we were, and then have us move inside, rather than transporting everything.  Kind of strange.  There were also several tables inside - it wasn't packed with a line of people waiting or anything.\n\nOnce inside, our next server (this seemed like #3 already, of what would be about 6 total servers throughout our evening) came by and was sort of awkward - saw we had half eaten spinach dip and said \""looks like your all set, I'll let you enjoy that,\"" without asking if there was anything else we needed at that time...again, no offer of WATER!  I asked for ice water, and she then looked to my husband...\""Did you want some, too?\""...OF COURSE.  Isn't that just a matter of course here in Phoenix, early September?  We were asked within a couple of minutes if we were ready to order and we hadn't even picked up the menus yet...we were talking, eating spinach dip, having drinks...again, very much a RUSHED feeling.\nWe ordered ribs which come with \""hand cut potato fries and coleslaw.\"" I said I would prefer a baked potato instead of hand cut fries.  The server's EXACT response: \""Okay.\""  Pause... \""But then you won't get the coleslaw either.  The baked potato counts as two sides.\"" Um, okay...I suddenly felt like I was ordering at a fast food restaurant.  Blown away.  I said nothing; I really didn't care about having coleslaw anyways.  My husband next ordered, also with a baked potato replacing the fries, but he said \""And I'd like to have my coleslaw please.\""  Server response: \""Okay, it will be $4.00 for the coleslaw.\"" Again, wow.  Where am I?  Certainly not an upscale restaurant...can we supersize here??!\n\nOur ribs were good; we were enjoying the food (again, for the most part...good, not great).  What happened next however, was that no less than 3 random servers came by in about a 12 minute period, none of whom were our original server, asking if we were done and if they could take our plates.  We were so far from done - I had about 75% of my meal still on my plate and my husband, while he was almost done with his ribs, was still working on the baked potato and the $4.00 *supposed to be included with meal* coleslaw.  It was so incredibly annoying; they kept interrupting our conversation and what was trying to be a relaxing, enjoyable evening out.  We finally gave in and said we were done (server number 6 asking)...who were these people?  Why isn't one server and one busser assigned to each table?  That way the same question wouldn't be asked 6 times...they've got to work on this.\n\nYet a different server came to see if we wanted anything else; my husband had to ASK for a dessert menu (it was not offered), and when he asked, server #7 (?) pretty much ignored the question and said \""Let me tell you...\"" and started rambling off I think four different desserts.  This would be fine, I suppose (even though I really prefer to read it from a menu and make my decision...a little more time, less pressure..) but we couldn't understand what she was saying was on top of the hot fudge sundae.  The place is a little loud...my husband asked her to repeat it, we both still missed it...I asked again...\""What's on top of the sundae?\"" And again, we both missed it.  Could not understand..whatever, this is why I'd like a dessert menu to READ.  I finally said, \""We'll have the key lime pie,\"" because we both still had no clue what might come on top of that sundae if we ordered it!\n\nThe key lime pie was disappointing.  We shared a piece and between the two of us we did not even finish half of it.  The crust had cinnamon in it, which tasted so wrong with key lime pie.  The kind of crust you would use for a pumpkin pie.  \n\nAll in all, not rushing back to Hillstone anytime soon.  They have got to work on the wait staff.  Too many people involved in our meal throughout the night and obviously not in a good way."
"1","Went to meet my mom for lunch last Friday with my little guy.  Instead of being greeted by the host staff, Carol walked up to me and announced that my stroller won't fit in the restaurant and that she would have to take it in the back.  What?  Ok...  This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?  They might want to come up with a better story and take a more discerning eye to the host staff.  I've always had such great experiences here in the past; what a disappointment.  We'll be over at Chelsea's.  They're cool with my wheels."
"2","The New York strip is the best steak in Phoenix, AZ. The loaded baked potato is magical in it's saltiness and smooth buttery-sour cream richness. The service is prompt and professional. The restaurant is housed in a beautiful building. The draft beer is a perfect temperature. The apple walnut cobbler is a force onto itself."
"1","Only the Biltmore Apple Store can make the typical shopper (me) feel like a total douche just by walking inside of it to be exposed to the cultish behaviors of Apple fanboys and girls.  This must be, like, the Ganges of Apple secularism.  One might introspect, \""Is this me?\""\n\nNo.  Its okay.  You certainly aren't one of the tools extolling Steve Jobs father's testicles for blessing the planet with the Divinity who created the most streamlined electronic products ever exalted on God's green Ge.  But look around, and this is what you will see at this particular locus.\n\nInteracting with the sales associates, these coal-shirted devotees, is what I imagine Muhammad faced when he met his 72 virgins in heaven.  These virgins, however, are massively haughty and generally useless. \n\nIn order for one of them to grace your presence and acknowledge your need for assistance, one must either 1) act like you're walking out of their store with one of their pretentious product under your shirt, or 2) make an appointment with their \""Genius Bar\"".\n\nF me running.  What a crappy state of affairs customer service is at this place. \n\nLet me get this straight, I cannot get anyone to help sell me overpriced, buggy Apple products unless I had the foresight to book their arses a week before?  Moreover, should the frequently occurring Apple jinx strike my iPod, its gonna take an appointment to tell me that you cannot fix it because you are not, IN FACT, a genius, but a $10 an hour fandork of Apple products and you wanted the 5% employee discount?\n\nThe 2 times that I've had problems with my iPod (i know, what a shocker!), they've just suggested that I reformat, thus erasing all of my files and losing playlists, et al.  Thanks genius.  Thanks for keeping up the good fight vs Microsoft, dweeb.\n\nAnd thanks for allowing me to check out -- not at the cashwrap, but right here, where we stand -- amongst the packed section of iPhones, where people are dorking out to these things.  I appreciate the dapper service, even though I'm plopping down the loot for two 'pods (which will inevitably be returned for two new ones in a few short months after I stump the geniuses over at the bar).  \n\nNow, I'm just blue-skying here, but how about you treat me like an actual human customer instead of an ATM machine, given that I've purchased 6 or so Apple products within the past 4 years?   \n\nI hate that Apple has been crushing the portable music market for several years now because their outposts for customer service are absolutely abysmal."
"1","I understand when a store is busy, every patron cannot get the attention they may need. However, I had questions about transferring my old MacBook Pro to an external hard drive so that when I purchased a new laptop, (which would've been today) I could have access to all of my old documents. I had an issue with my Apple ID,  so I was unable to make a Genius Bar appointment. I stopped by anyway to see if I could get some quick advice from one of the 12 kids doing nothing but standing around in blue shirts. I was promptly told there was no appointments and maybe I should drive to another store. No inquiry about my questions, no offer of any service at all. I was simply sent away, brushed off, told to go elsewhere. Ok, I mean I'll find another store that wants my business. I'm sure the 15 other people wandering around aimlessly touching every device in the store were about to make major purchases too...."
"2","Incredibly busy and crowded, but a great store still. \n\nSo I began my relationship with this Apple store location in 2007 when I bought a MacBook. They have serviced it accordingly, giving me several keyboards (when they were proven to be faulty), helping me on upgrades (including sending me elsewhere to save money), and showing me other products, like the iPhone and iPad, which I would eventually buy. \n\nThe Genius Bar is a good place to get help. I've been here several times and each time they were pretty quick and usually inexpensive. A couple of times they took longer but overall I am happy with the results. I've spent some money at this store for sure. Fixing issues with my computer, buying new devices, and getting accessories have all been things I've done at this Apple store. \n\nMy only true gripe about this location is the fact that sometimes MANY people are shopping at the same time for devices and waiting for someone in a blue shirt to \""open up\"" availability can be stressful and time consuming. On several occasions I've waited and waited only to be told that everyone is busy and they'll \""get to me when they can\"". \n\nDespite the long waits for service and for help with new devices (sometimes), I would still rate this location pretty well overall. The parking structure is covered and there is usually decent parking to be had, the employees are friendly and knowledgable, and turnaround time for service is pretty quick. Overall, I'm happy with Apple and their store on Camelback in the Biltmore."
"1","This is by far the worst Apple Store I have ever been too. The customer service is AWFUL, I have never dealt with such unprofessional people. After being told my computer was broken, I waited 45 minutes even though I told them the exact computer I wanted to buy. I was willing to pay $2,000 upfront to get the computer I needed. When it came time to purchase it, I let them know I needed it ASAP since I had to make it to class. At this point, they told me it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes for me to even get the computer!!!! Not to mention, I dealt with a total witch while trying to explain I had been at the store already for 45 minutes waiting to get this computer. I will probably never return to this store, as I don't appreciate having eyes rolled at me and employees tell me I'm being unreasonable."
"1","Not enough personnel to support the customer. Appointments don't mean nothing here. Still got seen late and I have a guy looking at my comp and another comp at the same time. Personnel hygiene is non existent for the Apple employees."
"1","This place is aweful! I got my brakes done and just 4 months later they were toast. Called to have them fix and they refuse. They took my 400 and now won't honor fixing their crappy job.\nMy advice- avoid this place at all costs."
"2","Hands down one of the best in Phoenix. Great food and wine.  Service is usually flawless. There is nothing not to like so bring out of towners or someone you care about and they will love you for it!"
"2","I'm stuffed!  No please, no more food!  Wait, it's free?  You just want to give me extra food because you feel like it?  Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car!\nI swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's.  They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars.  The food alone is divine!  I love every item on their menu!  The souffles are to die for as well.  But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal.  If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!"
"1","Meh, is right.  I've been wanting to try Vincent's since I moved to the area over a year ago.  I bought a groupon that I've been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.  Honestly can say that I could have done without. \n\nOur first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.  I get that your a French restaurant, but no need to decorate like we're still in the 80's.  Liquor bottles as a display? Doesn't look good.  It should have felt like an upscale restaurant, but it didn't.\n\nI liked that their menu is constantly changing.  Some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.  My husband and I probably went with the least interesting choices.  I started with the lobster bisque ($8).  For our main courses it was lobster with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.  The lobster was just ok, the basil pasta was overcooked.  Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good, but not worth the $34 price tag.  And none of the main entrees were under $32.  I get that you're a \""fancy\"" restaurant, but those prices are way too high.  I have no problem spending $30 on an entree, but it better wow me.  We'll just say Vincent's left something to be desired."
"2","Sonic is great. Great beverages and treats. This particular location is good. I have never had any issues with them."
"2","This place is outstanding! Great deal for french country bistro food. Very reasonable pricing, $20 for 3 course menu or order a la carte even cheaper.\n\nI am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care, I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm, service, food quality, and cheap prices as this place. \nIs the food culinary magic? NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).\n\nUnfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!! Great part is they will sometimes allow overflow to sit in one of the actual Vincent's dining rooms which instantly expands seating!"
"2","Had a lovely brunch here. \nLovely omelet with ham and Gruyere cheese."
"1","Last night we invited two couples from out of town to meet at Vincents Bistro. We made reservations for the evening. We enjoyed our dinner and wine, ordered souffle for dessert. Just as I was sipping my first cup of coffee, a server came to our table and told us we had five minutes to finish as people were waiting for our table. \n\nHow embarrassing, after telling everyone that this was one of my favorite restaurants. We spent hundreds of dollars on dinner and wine. Our meal was very good, but I don't think my friends will go back."
"2","Just stopped in here for the first time. New coffee lady, Sherry, was super friendly and made a delicious dirty pumpkin chai. Great for fall! My friend got a caramel mocha latte. It was also really good and decently priced-only $3.25!"
"2","Best. Doc's Office. EVER. \n\nMy primary care doc is Dr. Mansfield and she is AMAZING.... as is her assistant. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've also been to other docs if I'm really sick and can't get in to see her, and they've all been great. The front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through. You never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick, but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number. They listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds.... which I LOVE! These guys rock!!"
"2","I have been a patient of MVFP for over 10 years.  I have a great Dr. (Roseann Collins). And I find them to be organized and efficient.  Nothing but good experience with them.\nRichard"
"1","the carpet is torn, dirty and smell up on the 2nd floor\neven tho they vac it every day, its old and needs replaced\nas a member there about 4 yrs now, its now a health issue\nfor I sure would not wish to do any type of floor training on it"
"1","We were on a mission to find insulation that was not cellulose or fiberglass. We found a company online that sells polyester so headed here to find out if they could order it for us. Turns out they could and we ordered enough for our attic and were happy they could help us. However, when it came in, it was not as much as we ordered and the contractor we worked with at the pro desk was \""no longer with the company\"" (although I swear he answered the phone once or twice when I called our new contact Denise, who was lovely). The insulation also came in and was the 24\"" not the 16\"" we ordered, making so much extra work for us when laying down 1700 square feet of it. They refunded us the amount from the bags we didn't get, because they tried to get them but after the company said that aren't making it anymore (something about \""demand\"" even though we had just ordered 32 bags!). I was impressed with Denise, and the man who helped us load all of our insulation in the truck, but was not impressed with Mac who did not order us enough and did not get us the right size."
"1","Customer service here leaves a lot to be desired. Although they will help, it usually done with minimal personality and little to no professionalism."
"2","Ice House Tavern is a dive bar with character.\n\nBehind the bar is a large plexiglass wall with the Arcadia ice rink on the other side. The coolness of this is that you can sit at the bar and watch hockey or ice-skating while you drink. When we first arrived, there was a hockey game in mid-swing. There were multiple occurrences of goal shots gone wide, with a final destination of smacking against the back of the plexiglass bar wall near us. I found this to be highly entertaining, but it could definitely cause some people to get startled, so you might not want to sit directly at the bar if there is a hockey game on-going and you are easily spooked.\n\nThey've got darts, video games, plenty of seating and a good bottled beer selection. I wish they had a good micro-brew on tap, but alas, I settled for the bottle route. Thankfully, they've got some awesome bottled beers, like the 22 oz Arrogant Bastard Ale from Stone Brewery and Kiltlifter from Four Peaks.\n\nCool (literally) & unique dive bar. Check it out and then test your luck out on the ice.\n\nP.S. The place can be a bit difficult to find if you don't know where it is. Drive to the left of Wal-mart and into the back alley area, passing Arcadia Ice Rink & then make a left. You'll see banners at the top of the end of the first building. That's the spot. Enter on the side."
"1","I'm not a vegetarian, but who can honestly resist any manner of hash slung by a CULT? A cult right around the corner!!!  You dont even have to travel to California.  I came in with a good attitude, ready to acknowledge ( if not worship outright) all appropriate deities - but left a bewildered non believer.  \n\nWe endured baffling service, and it pains me to say it, because there was not a hint of rudeness. Just communication obstacles that I suspect involved more than language. To make a long story short, we had no idea what we ordered, despite numerous attempts to probe our waitress for such rudimentary information.  It was comic, really, until the food arrived. \n\nMy mother's Vietnamese entree was more a Greek tragedy of inedibly chewy mock chicken (she had asked several times for something easy to chew). Mine was better, but I've forgotten what it was.  The Seventh Heaven Salad was ok (more like third or fourth heaven) and we both liked the cup of complimentary chicken soup. That was a nice touch, and something we could all understand. \n\nIt took several minutes to communicate that we wanted a knife. I ordered  Thai iced tea, which unbeknownst to me was 'code' for ice water. It's hard to get too mad though.  Despite the confusion, it's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around.  People seemed nice, in an interplanetary way. We had what amounted to a disappointing pot luck, and the service was extraordinarily weird. \n\nBon appetit !!"
"1","= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR PETER PIPER'S WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nThis is a huge place, very inexpensive, & offers a buffet lunch of three kinds of salad, several pizza choices, & bread sticks.  Both the salads & the pizza were blah, & there was no other pasta, soup, potato salad, cottage cheese, or anything else like that to nibble on.  With rather loud music was playing, I couldn't enjoy reading the paper while I ate, so I bit down a few slices & left.\n\nCi Ci's next door is a better choice."
"1","Walked in on Saturday and walked out."
"1","My girlfriend moved in here 1 year ago. Within the first week, the a/c was leaking. Several repair request were made throughout the year. It was fixed but only for a few days. This has been a reocurring problem.We called yet Again on Thur. About the leak. They came out tix fix it. It did not leak for the rest of Thur. However, by Friday morning it was leaking again. She called to have it repaired. They said it would be taken care of. Another conversation was had that afternoon. They stated that a part had to be ordered and would be repaired by Tues. We returned home from our weekend away Sun. afternoon to an apartment with no a/c. Remember that this is one of the hottest months of the year in Phoenix being 107\u00b0 outside. Who knows what the temp was inside? Another call  was made. It was so unbearable to be in there. No cooking, sleeping or any other things were able to be done. Monday comes. Anther call was made. The manager said \""you were not told about the portable    \na/c unit we have available.?\"" Nope! They had it in there that afternoon. It barley cooled the bedroom which we were confined to. I get there while my girlfriend is still at work about 5pm. Still no a/c! She called again. They said\""It was repaired\"". There was no notice or any sign of anyone being there and the portable unit still in the room. Within 5 minutes they came and turned the breaker on. On Friday the repair man told us that we need to leave it off so no more damage to the unit is caused. We listened to him. They could have left a repair notice and or turned the breaker and thet unit back on."
"1","Overpriced Hawaiian food"
"1","Me 10 years ago: Panda Express, mmm good, and they give you lots!\n\nMe today: Panda Express is crap. It's got to be the most average, bland, over-Americanized \""Asian\"" food around.\n\nI challenge you to find more average/below average food chain anywhere in the state."
"2","Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!"
"1","I wish I could say that my complaints are isolated to this single store. They are not.\n\nThe food is cheaply done for a not so cheep price. One dish tends to taste like five others that they have. Like its the same sauce,  just with different meats and sometimes vegetables. \nIt feels like the place belongs in the food court of a mall. Not near a Goodwell. I suppose its location can tell you something about the quality of food one is going to get.\n\nThe employee always look over work and seem to not enjoy being there. It makes it feel like I have slave labor preparing my food. Which is a little disconcerting. \n\nThe bathrooms are not to bad, but at timea are filthy. At least the food and dining area look clean most if the time.\n\nI can't recommend this place as I avoid eating here myself."
"2","I love this place!!! Better than the other huge franchise in the valley. The cashier is so sweet and the food is always great. I hesitated going for awhile, because from the street it's not that impressive and if you're from here you know that getting good food here is a crap shoot. But I was running late one day so gave it a shot. The carne asada burrito is so good and the rolled taco supreme is just beyond words. Tricky to eat, but amazing. Wasn't crazy about their milk cake though, it was soggy, like it had been frozen and defrosted"
"2","I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle. What a beautiful performance. The scenery was beautiful, the dancers were great, the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training, overall it was amazing. This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again! Very professional and very entertaining."
"2","We have driven by this place for years and have never stopped in...boy, were we missing out!  We picked out several items for a picnic and had a great feast - salami, bierwurst, swiss cheese, pretzel sticks, sparkling water and Haribo gummies.  The staff is so pleasant and helpful and the prices are very reasonable, but make sure you remember your cash...no credit cards accepted!\n\nI'll definitely be back for rouladen, potato dumplings, mustard, red cabbage and other tasty treats!"
"2","Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!  Finally, a massage place that gives great massages with a great experience.  I've been there twice now and both times, my massage was perfect.  \n\nIt's located in a converted house on the south side of Indian School Rd., nice decorations and the people are all very friendly.  The massages are moderately priced so if you're looking for the deal of the century, go somewhere else, you get what you pay for here.  I've tried some of those deal places and the massages weren't great.  Here, GREAT massage at a great price.  I highly recommend."
"1","I have never been so disappointed in an oil change! First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door.  They never called.  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it.  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was.  (I had it checked out at different place).  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment.  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up).  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work.  They chose to scare me instead.  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything."
"2","I enjoy coming to this location because it is never super busy and the customer service is great. The staff is very friendly and the food is terrific \nSince the temperatures are semi-dropping, I do like that they have an outdoor patio because it's great to enjoy the evening weather...\nThe bathrooms are always clean"
"2","We go here all the time and I love the food I have tasted everything on the menu it's one of my favorite places!!!"
"1","This location is not as stellar as others. They usually have a bit of a wait and the regular employees do not seem thrilled to be there. The food is fine but the customer service alone makes it a chore to stop by."
"2","The staff here is great very friendly and always greeted with a hi & smile! I get my brows done by Jessica she is the master of brows! The salon is clean and professional,Wait time is good not too long.They carry a variety of hair products from Paul Mitchell,Redken,Matrix,TIGI,etc. Go In and see them for a great hair cut,color and waxing!!!!"
"1","Came in with my son and nephew.  Asked if I could add Chicken to a salad and first I was told no, and then I was told that I could but it would be  an additional 5.99 if I wanted chicken.  I have no problem paying extra for an addition however 5.99 is quite excessive.  Well I orders a medium cheese pizza for the boys and I will eat when I get home.  The customer service here was terrible.  It is no wonder the place was empty.  We will not be back and I will spread the word about what a great experience we had."
"1","After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here."
"2","If you are in the market for stationary or custom invitations this is the place... recently I had to get some invitations made for an engagement party I was hosting.  Being none artistic and a guy I was pretty intimidated... but Lydia was a great help... she understood what I was looking for and was able to get in and out in about 20 minutes and send me a proof within 48 hours.  Great customer service... but you also pay for it."
"2","My daughters and I have had the pleasure of working with the creative, delightful and incredible Lydia for several years and cannot say enough good things.  Paperjoy is that tiny unassuming shop where you instantly know you'll find what you want or Lydia will customize it for you.\nWedding invitations, save the dates, thank you notes, Christmas cards - you name it - all earn us compliments as they reflect our personal style and theme.  Their personalized, hands-on service was evident as I watched the last few bows be tied to perfection before picking up my invites.  \nIt's always my goal to support independent small business owners but Lydia makes it so easy.  This woman and her staff are one in a million!"
"2","Paperjoy is a lovely spot. \nI wandered in right before closing time during the busiest time of year to gather the necessary items I needed to make invitations for a holiday party. Justin stopped what he was doing to offer his creative help and find the special items to make my project ... special. \nThis is locally owned business does great work and has friendly, wonderful service and an abundance of high quality goods. Buy your paper here!"
"1","Ok, So I have lived here for almost a year...and am not renewing my lease for what I pay here I could get a nice house or town-home in the same area. I liked the area though and did not realize all the problems I would have upon moving in. My Sales Associate lied to me. I asked pretty specific questions upon moving in.  Upon moving in...I was told my Apartment was going to be a 3 bedroom on the third floor with new carpet...and paint...well when it came time to move in the apartment I was suppose to get was not ready, I had no choice because I had already vacated my last place...so they put me in another apartment, with stained carpet, shitty paint and tile and it still had furniture in it from the last tenant...and stuff in the drawers and cabinets...it had not even been cleaned and it was on the 2nd floor.\n\nHow much is the average electric bill I asked...they said no more then $200 in summer...mine has been closer to $300...nearly twice as much as what I was paying before I moved here for the same size unit.\n\n I asked how sound proof are the walls, am I going to be able to hear my neighbors...I live on the middle floor. They said I wouldn't it is a quiet complex, LIE...first night the people above me sounded like they were having a zumba class.  If you fart to loud your neighbors will probably complain...and the office will give you a ten day notice for farting to loud.\n\nThey failed to mention that the pet rent was a monthly charge not a one time fee. And this place is definitely not pet friendly, if you own a dog, and if that dog barks, don't live here...they will try to evict you every week for that one.  \n\nYou will get notices for everything.\n\nThey also did not explain that I would have to pay for water every month, which took them three months just to mail it to me. So your rent changes every month...it is never the same amount. Um...you pay the landlord the water bill not the water company...sound fishy!\n\nThis place sucks on all levels, the pictures do not do it justice, the apartments are old, the kitchen cabinets are 1990's, the fountain and grass are all gone, filled in with rocks and dirt. They landscaping sucks. Pool is ghetto, You can only get sun before 4pm otherwise it is blocked out by the buildings. And it is small, it is usually hoarded by fat people and screaming kids. And if anything breaks...it will take maintenance months to fix...because they never show up on time.\n\n The management office is a joke, no one is there to help you, they look at you like your a problem, I live in the biggest apartment they have and pay the most rent and pay on time...you think they would try to take care of a tenant like me...instead I get harassed.\n\nWorst Apartment complex ever.  Do not move in here. Move anywhere but here."
"1","Last night we went to spend the $150 gift certificate our daughter gave us a year ago---was not that excited to go.  Had eaten here a few times in the past but was never very impressed with the food.  And thanks to the reviews on Yelp still wasn't keen on going.  We went early to enjoy the happy hour which some had raved about.  I ordered the house martini, a vodka I had never heard of and surprisingly it was ok.  We had the tuna etutanesca, a \""seared\"" tuna--it WAS NOT seared but tasty, the edamame, good, and the pretzel bites with a cold cheese fondue which had to be sent back to be warmed.  Wine selection is not good---when Mirasou is on the wine menu at such an upscale restaurant you have to wonder---at least I did.  Wasn't really hungry but decided to have dinner anyway to use up the certificate.  We started with Lobster Bisque, HORRIBLE!--wrong color, did not taste any lobster and the garnish was mussel I believe.  Wanted the grilled peach salad--no peaches available--so shared the Asian Pear Salad, and still had some left over.  It was ok.  We also shared the Carbonara, tasty.  I finished off with the gelato and coffee ---good.  So with tips and the food we ended up spending $15.00 out of pocket.  I love the atmosphere but definitely will not be going back on my dime."
"1","My son likes to go there for poppers on the weekend.  His second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake.  This is the second weekend in a row that they have been out of both.   The first time, I thought it was a fluke.  Two weekends in a row is a trend.  If you run out of something daily, make more of it.  Obviously, there's now more of a demand for both of these.  You can make more of them to meet the demand or don't and demand will go down from people like me not coming back to your store.  Dunkin Doughnuts, here we come again!"
"2","My stylist was very knowledgeable. Yay, 13$/haircut!  She even knew about my natural curls & told me how that would work w/haircuts I wanted. Thanks!"
"1","Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (Sunnyslope/Dunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines! \nThe couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them. \nThe odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals."
"2","Friendly, Caring, and Honest.  What more can you expect from an animal hospital?  Their new building is very attractive and roomy and the staff is very accommodating.  They're prices are reasonable as well.  Thanks for taking such good care of Mufassa guys!"
"2","Hands down the most amazing vet one could ask for. Every time I bring my bunny in they always ask to come pet her, and finish her appointment on time or ahead of schedule. \n\nWhen I brought River in to have her fixed, they called the next day to follow-up and check on her, and then returned my calls promptly or put me through to a vet immediately to answer some medication questions that I had. \n\nI am so impressed with their care, as well as their follow-up. I would highly recommend them."
"1","DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding. If you want a list of who actually used the valet, forget it. Expect to meet every deadline they give you with your payments, but do not expect such promptness from them. And if you use their \""preferred vendors,\"" remember who some of those vendors really work for at the end of the day... I have my contract on record for anyone who wants a glimpse at the \""whole picture.\"" Trust me when I say that the beautiful, sugary sweet image you get on your initial visit, will not depict the financial reality here."
"2","I've been in many presidential suites, few better than the one here.\nEverything is superb.\nAttention to detail, focused and sharp.\nAnd the room itself?\nRomantic with it's outdoor showers, making you feel almost naughty when showering.\nAnd room service?\nI enjoyed the eggs benedict, although it was somewhat cold.\n\nToo bad I onlly have until till two o'clock to get this room cleaned and ready for shift manager inspection."
"2","This place is gorgeous.  I haven't stayed in the rooms, but have dined in T. Cooks many times and have attended several functions in the banquet rooms.  It's always a great experience.\n\nFrom the moment you arrive at Valet to the end of your event, the customer service here is awesome.  The banquet staff always goes over and above to make sure you're well taken care of.  At one particular breakfast meeting there wasn't any ice water available in the pre-breakfast area.  Instead of telling me \""there's water inside\"", they went in and got a fresh glass for me.  At another meeting, I asked for a Lime for a Diet Coke I was drinking....they walked to the bar inside the building to slice up a fresh Lime for me, very cool.\n\nWhenever there's an event here, we try our best to attend because we know it will be over the top.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
"1","In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\n\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\n\nSo take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\n\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\n\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\n\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\n\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed."
"2","I have loved this place for a long time.  It troubles me that people write such negative things in their reviews.  Hi, it costs money to have a credit card machine and if you don't spend over five bucks it costs the COMPANY money. Duh.   And in regards to closing early, yes, it is a bummer.  However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead.  In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here.  That says a lot.\n\nThe coffee is delicious, latte art very cool and the new baked goods made in-house are absolutely to die for.  Keep up the great work guys!"
"1","About two months ago I needed to get waxed, and I would normally head to the Brow Lady but thought I'd give the Spa a chance, since I'm there daily already. I called in advance for an appointment. I went in and was led to the Relaxation Room by the very friendly Spa receptionist. I had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment, hoping she could take me sooner and I could be on my way sooner. There was not one other person in the Relaxation Room with me. There also isn't a wall clock and I soon found out why. \n\nMy extra ten minutes pass. No waxer approaches me. Another ten minutes go by and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on. I decide to go up front and see what the deal is. The receptionist says she will find out and I tell her I have places to go and can't wait much longer. I go back to the relaxation room...which is now not at all relaxing. Five more minutes pass....the receptionist comes to say she's sorry and the waxer will be right with me. It was at least another five, maybe even ten, and I was boiling mad. The waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping 2 minutes.  Sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment. The receptionist didn't think it was worth comping me the $13.50 cost so the waxer received no tip. \n\nThe second time I used the Spa was when I injured my back in one of the classes and had to run, crying, out of the class. There is no Sports Medicine person on staff as far as I was aware so I hobbled to the Spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon. I begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didn't start until 9AM. This, by the way was at about 8:10AM. I'm standing in front of this woman, having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and she's telling me to wait an hour? Finally she figured out I was NOT kidding and said she'd call around to see who could come in ASAP. She helped me into a chair in the very UN-relaxing room and I wept alone there for about 15 minutes. She happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in 15-20 minutes. I had no cell phone, watch or wall clock to measure that time, nor was any other help offered so I just continued weeping. It was 8:30AM (I'm guessing) when another spa-goer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change. I managed to get in there as well (after a bit) and ask her if she knew the time. 8:45AM. \n\nObviously my massage therapist didn't show up until 9AM. That would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury. Sure the massage was decent (not in price mind you). I just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and I absolutely will not return there. By the way, the showers in the spa area are TERRIBLE. The ones in the locker room are much better and on the whole the bathroom/locker room in the spa is a waste of space."
"2","I have been going to this place since I was about 11 years old!  So that is about 15 years...crazy!! Just like Nadia said... The village really is a way of life and a lifestyle...Now it is not cheap to be a member...but that is up to each individual that is willing to pay the monthly fee.  I was a member before they did their huge renovation...there used to be a Garcias restaurant next door and that closed and they took over!  Their spa is beautiful...their restaurant and bar area is a nice place to grab a bite and enjoy a glass of wine...the locker rooms are beautiful and are very nice and clean!  They have so many classes and options for everyone! The trainers and instructors all have so much experience and they really know what they are doing...they have really set themselves apart from any other workout facility or gym...it is expensive but as long as you know what the costs are it is worth it..."
"1","Went there on a weekday for dinner with people I work with  - music was so loud could hardly talk. This is not a nightclub but with the music blaring you  alomosty thought you were in one  if you closed our eyes.  Pizza was good...more \""designer pizzas\"" than a good old pizza place - okay if you don't mind paying for an over-priced pizza.  Did not care for the chicken wings. Not sure what the fuss is about this place."
"1","This pains me to write this review and I am giving 2 stars out of fairness and previously solid history with LGO as I live a few blocks away.  I have been there hundreds of times previously.  I have had many wonderful experiences previously and have referred dozens of friends to LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen, Postino, etc.  \n\nSo, it's this past Sunday morning and I run in real quick for a few breakfast items, those being English muffins and a regular iced mocha latte.  The place was packed as usual but seemed more so because of far too much merchandise and no where for people to wait or even stand.  The service was friendly.  In case you haven't tried the English muffins, they come in a 5 pack and they are very tasty-a must have and great toasted.  \n\nMy heart burn on this visit begins at the register.  Two two items together totaled $18.02.  I was shocked so I asked the girl at the coffee bar register if she rang it in right and she assured me she did. She was very nice about it but OMG WTF?  I paid and came home.  The mocha was way too sweet and not even comparable to Starbuck's(which I do not like for the record).  So, essentially, I paid $18.02 for a pack of English muffins.  Ridiculous!  Will I go back?  Most assuredly I will but it will be a bit before I do."
"2","Wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is REALLY good?\n\nWhen you \""drool a little bit\"" in between bites, like I did today with my Chopped Turkey Salad from La Grande Orange.\n\nI went there on Sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T !!!\n\nIf it weren't for the \""Drool Event\"" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.\n\nI shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.\n\nMy son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.\n\nThe \""Olive Oil Cake\"" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \""oilier\"" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \""Oh My God!\"" good.\n\nNow for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.\n\nIt was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \""to go\"" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGreat.  Decision.\n\nI don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.\n\nI just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.\n\nNot too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.\n\nI WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic."
"2","LGO never fails me.  It is absolutely my favorite place to have brekkie.   \nIt is a tradition to head to LGO when I am in Phx visiting KD. Simply said, I would not leave satisfied if we didn't go. Today I was able to introduce my friend Mike S to this favorite of mine. I do believe he left this fine establishment as a fan.  Other friends joined us today and the majority of the table had a commuter sandwich.  It is the BEST breakfast sandwich on the planet.  It consists of an English muffin (made at LGO), eggs, tomato and mayo.  My meat of choice on the commuter is bacon.  This sandwich is addictive!  \nThe best thing about LGO is that you cannot go wrong with anything you order.  You will leave happier (impossible not to). I have been to LGO too many times to count but each time I leave, I 'm one happy camper!  Mike and I were waiting for our food, looking at the other items that were ready and thinking that everything looked scrumptious.  On days that the commuter has not been my choice, I have had the french pancakes (delicious) or the fruit (always so nice and fresh). \nLGO has a fun atmosphere and a cute store to wander around in while you wait.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention their iced tea.  I always have the standard iced tea but I know people also greatly enjoy their iced green tea.  I started with the iced tea and as much as I love green tea, I can't move beyond the regular iced tea.  I also appreciate being able to get a refill before I exit.  \nAlso, I always marvel at the sweet treats from Tammy Coe in the display cases by the register. On occasion, I bring some back to Tucson to share.\nLove love love LGO!!"
"2","The fresh MJ breads and Tammie Coe cakes/pastries are the best on the west coast.  The communter sandwich is my favorite breakfast food.  The to go salads are fresh and more than you can eat. It is a very popular place, so be prepared to wait in line, but it is worth it!"
"2","THe LGO grocery is quite unique.  You walk into the front and you see a menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, pizzas, and incredible desserts.  When you turn the corners, you run into a lot of cool trinkets, unique snacks, soaps and lotions, and much more.  The prices are a bit unreasonable, but that is expected of a store that is within a nice restaurant.  I think the rosemary raisin almond crackers looked the most interested that was within price range.  My eyes were glued towards the wine as well.  I will have to update this review once I buy something here."
"2","I've eaten majority of their menu and haven't found anything that I haven't liked.  It's a great place for any meal.  My boyfriend is more a breakfast person and I'm more of a lunch person so this place is perfect for us.  I love their avocado pizza - we did it with proscuitto once and it was fantastic.  The spicy tuna roll makes a great appetizer.  The white sangria is probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  For dessert, the red velvet cupcake is unbelievable - the frosting is the best part.  The parking kinda stinks but you can always park across the street at arcadia room and walk to LGO.  Can't say how much I love this place!"
"2","I went here on a morning with my wife and kids.  We left a large resort and were on our way out of town headed to the Grand Canyon.  Perhaps the service leaves something to be desired because it is a grocery that has a kitchen, but the food is out of this world.  My daughter was disappointed in the pancakes because they were more like crapes, but I loved them and my older kids loved it all.  It did not matter since she ate half of my wife's egg white omelet.  We all shared and I would go back every week if I could.  Certainly all the locals seem to be doing that."
"2","Love this place. \n\nThey have a bunch of great little kitchy gifts, sweet-arabilia (candies from \""yester years\""), some great wines, and a great deli counter.\n\nA few of my faves to leave w/, or find a table to enjoy at outside if I can, their hot pressed cubano and a coconut cupcake. De-e-a-licious.\n\nIts always crowded here, but if you wait out the line, youll see why."
"2","The best coffee and pastries in town! Get there in the early AM and enjoy the outdoor setting.\nGreat for cyclist who are out on a ride a want a place to rest and fuel up. Also great for family and friends just hanging out."
"2","Time for an update on one of my favorite Phoenix places to eat, grab a bottle of vino or a clever gift!   This last trip I did two out of the three!  I had a delicious lunch and grabbed some gifts.  I have to say that if I owned a restaurant, it would be just like LGO.  I love this place and am always happy to be in LGO, whether perusing the wine or the groovy items in the store.  I am the MOST happy when I am eating some yummy food.  For years, I have been mildly obsessed (my friends will know I am underplaying my obsession) with the commuter sandwich.  It is so very good.  Pretty much perfection. The delicious English muffin, the eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo.  It rocks my world!  \nThis trip, I tried something new (gasp!).  I was also so happy I did and will now have some debating to do when I am having a bite to eat at LGO.  This time I had the brown rice bowl.  I was opting for something on the healthy side.  This dish was some seriously tasty ingredients combined in a bowl.  Such great flavor!  As usual, I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix and my visit to LGO!"
"2","A fun and tasty menu in an adorable shop tucked into a super cute little area.  A wonderful selection of breads to take home (among which are their famous giant English muffins), breakfast, sandwiches and salads, delectable desserts at reasonable prices.  Lots of patio seating, and super busy just about any time (weekends most of all), with spotty service.  \n\nFOOD: If you're breakfasting here, the commuter is incredible! Try it with salmon and avocado, but be sure to leave room for dessert!  The French pancakes are swell, and so is everything else I've tried, but the commuter is far and away the winner, whether you add any kind of meat or not.  If you're going for healthy, get the mayo on the side.  Red velvet anything is great here, as is the key lime pie.  \n\nSHOP: The odds-n-ends shop is my favorite eclectic collection around - I measure other cute shops by their yard stick (e.g. \""this place is kinda cute in a La Grande Orange kind of way\"" - but no other place quite measures up).  I've bought kitchen supplies, clothing, jewelry, books, dog toys...I could go on.  Everything is at least a little bit interesting!  I highly recommend the Out of Print and Yoganastix clothing brands - I've bought both from here and they've stayed soft and nice with much wear.   \n\nSERVICE: To be honest, the service is spotty to poor.  For a while, I had orders mixed up almost as often as correct - with no apologetic attitude, to boot - and I stopped going.  My last few visits have been pretty great (aside from overhearing a woman who had terrible service getting no help at all to make it better).  It's definitely a risk.  It's so popular that the counter employees don't seem concerned with customer service at all (the servers in the main restaurant are great, if you come for a sit-down dinner, but that's a different Yelp listing)."
"2","This place is the perfect man cave.\n\nTremendous selection in their large humidor, highly knowledgable staff, a smoking room with deep leather chairs and a big TV.\n\nBest of all, it's BYOB! My buddies and I have lately picked up beers at AJ's around the corner, brought them into the smoking room, lit some sticks and forgot about life for a while. I love Churchill's and will be coming back many more times."
"2","When I was here last week, one of the other folks at the table asked me if there were lots of places like this in Ann Arbor, where I live.  Sadly, I had to answer no.  There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.\n\nThe warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?\n\nThe bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.\n\nAnd of course, I enjoyed the wine.  In warm weather, I'm a white wine kind of gal, so I sipped a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. I was totally charmed by both the food and the company. Oh, and extra charm points for playing some Otis Redding. The service was just fine -- attentive without being intrusive. If they can't open a Michigan location, then I guess I'll just have to come back the next time I'm around Phoenix."
"2","Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  \n\nAs for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.\n\nI usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.\n\nThis place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!"
"2","Love this place!!!   It is so small and dark and quaint!!!  Huge wine selection...and that bruschetta ......Yum!\n\nI didn't really need to add my review because there are so many and most agree that is place is great.\n\nMy favorite thing about Postino is on Mon and Tue nights .....you can buy a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 ..plenty for two!\n\nParking can be hard around here...but they offer valet for $3.."
"2","When I first saw the menu, I wasn't sure if this place was going to live up to the hype.  It appears that they pretty much just have a handful of appetizers and a few different panini's and bruchetta.  \n\nWow, was I mistaken!  This place definately lives up to the hype.  The artichoke dip and hummus were like the best I've ever had.  The wait staff was very friendly, helpful and prompt with everything.  This would be a great place to kick back with some friends, have a few drinks and enjoy some amazing food."
"2","I've been to Postino a countless number of times, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food (especially the small sandwiches and bruschetta) is delightful.\n\nIf you're thinking about going during happy hour or for dinner, I recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, or expect to wait.  It can get pretty packed."
"2","I love Postino. I just wish it was closer. It's a great place to go after work with a few friends for drinks, but then I gotta drive home...  The $20 deal for wine and bruschetta is as good as everyone says. The prosciutto with figs bruschetta is so delicious, the salty flavor of the prosciutto combined with the sweetness of the figs is heavenly. I also love the smoked salmon and pesto combination. If you're a little hungrier and want something to yourself, the paninis are extremely satisfying. My favorite is the Autostrada, it's spicy and savory and a little bit different from any panini I've had anywhere else. The wine selection could be better, but the truth is if you're drinking out and it's not a special occasion, most people are going to want a decent house wine and leave it at that, and Postino's house wines are just fine."
"2","I love Postino's! Great food and wine. The only downside is that it is on the smaller side and cannot always accomodate large groups."
"2","I really enjoy their bruchetta. Their brunch is really good and the mimosas are tasty."
"2","Parking is always a jam, but the food and atmosphere rocks."
"2","I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.  I've always enjoyed the prosciutto with brie sandwich.  Try to bring cash when possible for valet.. Parking can get pretty crazy.  \nService is always Outstanding!  Worth the drive and wait!"
"1","First off FRYS you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee I seen that was being talk down to because of his age. Let me paint you a picture of what I seen and heard. I went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a Frys apron. He went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good. It appeared he was just asking for that day. The front end manger replied, \""I am not sure I don't know if you know how to do anything else. I just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before I consider anything else. I know I was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time. Let me tell you something Mr, Front end Manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and I am sure worked his tail off. Do NOT ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind  assistance where you can offer it. That is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or I am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go. So after listening to this and no it was not my business but I am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyone's business but we still slow down to see the wreck. So I proceeded to get my $325.00 of groceries at your place when I should have walked right out and drove down the road. I went isle to isle and as I neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear. Yes, I looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks (Are you serious what is wrong with you) type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees. However it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out. Because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile. Now let me gentle remind you FRYS without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day. I was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain -and not do something. So every week about 2 times I make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder. SHAME ON YOU! for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures. I wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means. But I figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse. Mark my words! If I ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as I pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by Home depot that I can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear."
"2","I went here for lunch the other day and I was surprised i hadn't heard of this place sooner. It was great. The bread was delicious, service and ambiance were superb and the pork sandwich I had was amazing. Everything was seasoned just right and I left feeling very full. It is too bad I had to go to work after because there specialty drinks and import drafts looked great. I will go back for dinner very soon."
"2","I've been to each of the three locations and I always leave even more certain that Havana Cafe has earned its spot on my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix list.  First time you go, go for tapas - it's a wonderful way to try a little of everything.  And if you have the opportunity to order ANYTHING that comes with banana guava ketchup, DO IT.  I typically dont even like ketchup but... wow."
"1","We went with a group of friends, and were very disappointed, I have been there before and I strongly recommended place, however food was terrible and overprice, I don't what had happened, service was poor, waited long for waitress to take order, or even take the drinks order, when she finally took order for food it took more than one hour wait for food to come  one at a time, 20% was added to bill, and this was not OK specially after poor service. Anyway will definitely won't EVER go back...."
"2","i thought it was good and it's cheap mexican. just dont expect anything fancy-don't know that i would actually eat inside."
"2","The best bar in the world.... The best wings in the world. \n\nJT is awesome...."
"2","I love the spicy eggplant here. Its not super spicy so I add hot mustard, but its way yummy. The eggplant is tender, flavorful and melts in your mouth without being mushy. My friend had the Desert Jade Egg Fu Yung and she said it was amazing. The service is good, quick and efficient. Overall a great place to get your chinese food fix."
"2","I have grown up on this great chinese food! The menu has many options and ALL the food is great! Many family memories were made! The sizzling rice chicken, sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls, soups and fried rice are delicious! If you become addicted to this restraunt you will be treated like family!"
"1","If your into over cooked eggs and your hash browns drowning in oil accompanied with a server with a chip on her shoulder, then this is the place for you.\nI will never return and i recommend you reconsider before going and dropping the money they are asking for this sub-par food. Go to Denny's, your food will be prepared much better and taste just as equal with probably better service. At you wont have toworry about your server reach over you and across the table to pick up your straw wrapper. I mean really! Ask me to hand it to you, DON'T reach across!"
"1","How can I give a restaurant anything higher than 2 stars when they serve burnt hashbrowns (I posted a picture). It looked fine when they brought it over but as I was eating it, it tasted really weird so I looked on the bottom and it was BLACK!.  I don't know how a chef/cook can ever serve anyone something so burnt. I wouldn't even care if had a little burn on the edge but this thing was ALL black and it was awful.  Never in my life have I been served something like that. \n\nMy friend had the crepe which I tasted and it was really good. She also ordered the country potato over the hashbrown which was a good move for her. \n\nAfter I complained they brought back a hot new order of hashbrown but it took a while (about 15 minutes) and they didn't seem too apologetic so I wasn't very pleased. I have no plans to go back!"
"1","spent nearly entire evening vomiting after ordering Taylor's Cafe \""Joe's special\"" (ground beef, spinach, onion, etc.) ...a dish I normally love there.  It's the only thing I ate all day, so I'm certain it was this dish.  Awful night.\nRichard"
"1","I work in the industry; needed to get nose pad replacements for expensive wire frames I wear everyday; they charged me 24 dollars with tax;  I could get them for free at most optical shops;  enough said."
"2","The Shoe Shop is a wonderful, neighborhood spot. To really make living convenient, this location is at the Southwest Corner of 40th Street and Camelback in the same shopping center as Wild Oats. They repair all types of shoes, mens, womens, childrens, from high heel designer offerings to everyday flipflops. Another specialty is leather repair, which they can work on broken or damaged straps, handbags, and belts. If your new diet is working so well that your belts are too big for you, the guys in the store will punch you a new hole to save you from having to buy anything new. The service is always prompt, and the turnaround time is excellent, more often than not, int less than 3 days. Overall, if you need any repair that involves your shoes or leather goods, please visit The Shoe Shop in Arcadia."
"2","I was so sad when my favorite leather flip flops broke! I had them in my car for about two months before I realized that right next to the new fresh & easy on 40th and Camelback was a shoe repair.  I went in the guy said \""no problem I can fix this\"" and said it would be ready the next day. \nI came back the next day and not only were they fixed to perfection they were polished and beautiful and looked new. \nI will definitely be going back! \nOh and did I mention it was all done for $14.95, pretty good."
"1","For some reason my parents loved the Golden Coin chain when I was a child, and this seems to be the only one left standing. Maybe it was better back then, I don't really know. First of all, I hate buffets with a fiery passion, but this is by far the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of being dragged to. The ambience of the restaurant makes you feel as if you're eating your last meal in prison before being sent off to the chair. The food was gross and the food options were miniscule. I only had a few bites because I didn't like it and I was worried I'd get sick, if you ever visit this dive trust me, you'll feel the same way. The booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed. Bottom line, they should have just let this buffet chain die."
"1","This place just refused service. I have come here many times before! This time I had a hang nail that had bled but I informed them that it had not bled for 24 hours and that I have been keeping it properly cleaned for sanitation sake. They refused to fix the nail claiming that it was still bleeding. I told them that it had not been for a day but they argued with me saying that it would burn. I told them I have experiences far worse and that pain was not an issue. They made me wait 20 minutes and then refused service. I will NOT be coming back!!"
"1","The Great Escape is Closed.  Now, unfortunately, it's the Little Woody.  Another pretentious take over."
"2","Good Times are had at Dilly Dally and if not, then you just have not drank enough.\n\nAnd just when you think you have hit rock bottom, go next door and order wings and eat them in the parking lot and put the chicken bones in your purse.  NOW, you have hit rock bottom."
"2","I am thrilled to have found such a wonderful animal clinic. I have three PUGS with three very different personalities. Luckily we don't have to go to see Dr. Bracken too often. But when we do, it is always a good experience. Dr Bracken and his wonderful staff are extremely professional and attentive. I live closer to downtown and will gladly bypass the many animal clinics closer to me to visit Arcadia Animal Clinic. I do end up waiting sometimes, but I do not mind. I know that Dr. Bracken gives a lot of thought and attention to the animals he is taking care of. I recommend Arcadia Animal Clinic to everyone I meet that have a pet or pets in their life. *******Plus its right by LGO, so you can stop and grab a bite or a latte on your way home!"
"1","The office is very poorly run, wait times too long and highly disorganized.  Even after numerous phone calls to have my name and address removed from their records, they still continue to mail reminders to me and my dogs (one of my dogs passed away 2.5 years ago while under the care of Braecken).  I never even received a sympathy call after he passed.  Not the kind of vet's office I will ever take my remaining 3 rescues to."
"1","Worst Italian food ever. Rude waiter. Decore very lame. Room full because of coupon customers. I don't know where other reviewers have gone but don't listen to them! Stay away."
"1","The car was a Prius by Toyota...One of those electrical / mechanical hybrids that require a NASA Certification License to operate!  I left the car there to have it oil & lubed, then a wash.  I was told it would be about approximately an hour or so before it would be ready.  So off I went to do some errands in the vicinity.  When I got back, I found that the car wash left the door open and that the vehicle wouldn't start...To my surprise all power was dead and it didn't have the power to turn on a flashlight!  It took a friend of mine to arrive with a pair of jumper cables and some patience as we had to slowly re-charge the battery and for the electronics on board to realize the charge.  After about an extra hours delay, I was able to re-start the car and drive off.  The car wash waived its' charges, but I was still a bit torqued of the situation because of the incompetence of the staff about the new hybrid automobiles(they shouldn't accept vehicles they are unfamiliar with!). .----I give them two stars for cleaning my tires and for draining my batteries."
"1","I wish I could give zero stars! I should have known better to come back after I was misquoted the price for fluff and fold my first visit here, but I was in a pinch.  I dropped off a large amount of clothing, some wash and some dry cleaning.  I told them when I needed it by, and they said no problem.  They called me later to let me know a lot of the pieces were dry cleaning and they might need longer - I told them I left it with them because I needed it at a certain time and if they couldn't do the job by then I would come by and pick it up.  They said they would have it ready.\n\n$317 later, I have my laundry.  85% of what I dropped off was laundry, but they were so lazy that they dry cleaned 85% of it instead.  I have about 20 cotton, machine wash tank tops that they dry cleaned to the tune of almost $6 a piece!  Are you kidding?  LAZY and UNPROFESSIONAL.  When I got home and realized what had happened, I called to inquire.  The guy on the phone was so rude and accused me of being 'nasty,' said he did me a favor (?) and then hung up on me.\n\nI would absolutely never come back here.  I really can't believe the nerve they had to dry clean so many cotton, machine wash pieces, and then tell me they did me a favor while sticking their hand in my wallet.  LAZY LAZY LAZY."
"2","although i've eaten my way through half of phoenix, this is my first review. hi all!\n\nwent here for lunch on tuesday and since it was my first time, i stuck to the basics and had the windy city slider with cheese, a milk shake and fries. my milkshake was amazing - not too thick or overly sweet and actually tasted like milk was an ingredient. imagine that! the slider was decently sized and delicious. my favorite part was the bun. oh, the bun! now my dream is to sleep on a bed made of those buns.\n\nChicago Hamburger Co. is the kind of place where you're constantly sneaking glances at and coveting what other people ordered. the owner is awesome. he personally brought our food to the table and made sure to stop and chit chat, even during the crazy lunch rush. \n\nwill i be back? my arteries say no, but my taste buds say YES. and who am i going to listen to? the taste buds every time. i love these kind of establishments and urge everyone to support the business and ignore their arteries as well!"
"2","The pictures and video say more about this place than I could in a review. It's a great neighborhood burger joint, and I'm happy it's a short walk from home.\n\nEverything I've had here is solid for a fast food joint. Once, around the holidays, I ordered their 10 slider deal, and ate them all myself. It was delicious but I hated myself a little after. Trust me when I say two or three are enough for one person. The chicago style dog is my standard here, they get everything right down to the steamed poppy seed bun, the fries that come with it are just average though. I also really enjoy the avocado burger, the grilled onions take it from good to great.\n\nI always like the mix of people that go to this place. Feels like the burger joint in the town I grew up in. Last time there was a teenage couple on a date, three elderly gals out for a meal, a married couple with a kid who I might have been annoyed with if he didn't have the cutest little biker jacket with a skull on it, and some guys watching a game on the TVs."
"2","From the outside I thought no, and even inside, it is not clear what to do - for the uninitiated ORDER AT THE COUNTER, but once the akwardness disappears you will think yummy. Have tried their dogs and cheeseburgers, along with fires and onion rings - all good - messy but good - give it a try, you will keep coming back -even if you are not from Chicago !"
"2","I frequent this place often. It's a Dive and I love it. The owner is this older hippie guy that is super friendly and down to earth. A must to try is a great peanut butter shake.  I love it."
"2","If you're new to the Valley and have absolutely no idea what grows here, come to Baker's.\n\nIf you've lived a long time here, know what doesn't shrivel to a dead dry crisp as soon as the thermometer hits 100 and are looking for plants and shrubs and trees, come to Baker's. \n\nIf you're just really, really into flora, come to Baker's. \n\nSometimes, hubby and I just drive over to spend a couple hours nosing around all the great stuff here--like roses, garden ornaments [not just plants], herbs, and lots of useful advice. All the folks who work here know their stuff and have probably been working here since they were kids themselves. We've even purchased an apple tree that thrives in Phoenix and produces little apples from Baker's!!\n\nSo green up your thumb and get yer yard stuff here."
"2","I have found the Garden of Eden , a place so wonderful that it inspires dreams, hopes and desires. When driving to Baker I began being fearful that once more I would be let down by a garden shop. So many times I have opened my heart to others but they have let me down. Some are out of state, some are too commercial and some really are about big business . But Baker isn't like that . From the time I pulled up I felt at home and loved.. the  old signage  giving me the vintage vibe, nice. Lots of space  and stuff to look at , a Potpourri of Pottage even. The variety of herbs and veggies alone were enough to make my heart purr. The  plants  were lined up neatly  in rows that screamed  we are cared for but not over watered and ignored.We are plants that won't get home and die from some  a mystery interloper who we brought into your garden . The grounds , employees , plants and set up all seem to express : We Too Love Gardens just Like You!\nI was so pleased to find my new partner in living green  , oh happy day ."
"2","Bakers Nursery is where I've spent the majority of my weekend mornings.  I've either been pointed to a needed plant, or discovered it on my own.  Folks have always been helpful & informative.\n\nI will agree that they are pricey but big box stores cannot compare to the inventory at Bakers. Moreover, I'm do not agree with Yelp colleagues' low reviews. Unfortunately, gardening is 'at risk'. You figure out what your soil & attention span will foster and you are successful with those plants. Indeed, gardening comes with a learning curve that comes with failures & successes.\n\nTheir niche in the neighborhood will be a chasm after December."
"1","I have been a customer of Thai Lahna for 12 years.  The service I have received on my last three visits has been so bad, I now pledge to never return.  I don't make this decision lightly because they have pretty good food.  Last night I placed an order to go and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 25 minutes later and was told it would be ready in another 10 minutes.  After waiting another 30 minutes (a total of 55 minutes since I had placed the order), I asked to see the manager who had been in the kitchen this whole time.  I was told she would be right out.  I stood there at the cash register another 10 minutes; no manager.  I asked again to see the manager (my food order was still not ready).  From the kitchen I heard \""Tell him I am too busy!\""  That was the last straw.  I asked for a refund on my credit card.  Instead of a refund, they charged my card a second time.  While she was fixing that, my order finally came out.  I told them to keep the food and give me my money, which they finally did.  This is a place where management has completely lost touch with what service is all about.  The girl at the counter was trying desperately to help me.  If the manager had put forth even a half effort, I might have been able to shrug it off.  Her total dismissal of the customer prompts me to take my business elsewhere.  I would encourage you to do likewise."
"1","Been to many thai places, service at this one is rude and slow, more expensive then most other places and small portions, forget it, dont easte your money!"
"2","I rented 3 pieces of equipment at different times over the course of 2 days. Everyone who attended to me was energetic, polite, and super-helpful  \nFirst, they steered me to the right equipment (tile breaker and chisel.) The chisel gets sharpened after each rental. The guy at the desk and the guy in the pickup room both gave me instructions on how to use it, with their names and an invitation to call back if I had any questions. The equipment worked beautifully. \nI went back later that day to get a tile scraper (also freshly sharpened.) Same great service and attitude all around, from 2 different employees.\nTip: first timers might have some trouble finding where to park. You go behind the street-front building and angle park in front of the back building. Then you drive out through the street-front building, picking up your gear along the way."
"1","Hi All, \nJust an update, 2/23/2013- I changed Drs because of the admin fee and the office is still trying to charge another \""administration fee\"".  Soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged.  Was forced to pay the first fee because I was a patient, trying to get the most recent fee charged last month removed since I'm not their patient- patient beware, it's like a bad late night infomercial, \""How do I cancel???!\""  grrrrr"
"1","I do not recommend."
"2","Studio 360 is a gem to say the least and for quite a few reasons: student pricing, cycling shoes available for anyone who has yet to invest in their own pair, incredibly encouraging/talented/kind/inspiring instructors, phenomenal music, new bikes, and it's all in the dark which adds a whole new slew of pluses! Even though it's a group class, it in no way resembles others I've participated in. The darkness allows you to focus on your individual experience and forget about how much you're sweating, how red you've become and how much better others may be.  There's nothing like a spin class at Studio 360, an hour of physically strenuous cardio never flew by so quickly and felt so dang good! \nThis is active meditation; a totally elating, calorie-burning, cardiovascular adventure!"
"1","It's cheap and is open at 6 a.m.  This is pretty much the only pros I can think of this place."
"2","I like Pei Wei, its good when I want something fast. But the main reason for my review on here today was to say HOW AMAZING the manager was at this location. \n\nI came in at lunch and it was VERY busy. There was a line to the door. There were some arguments about someone stealing a seat (unhappy customer, complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line, wanted to be comped because of it.... so dumb if you ask me. I mean just deal with it people! Its busy!) But the manager dealt with it so professionally, and when I was next in line he did not act rushed, he was very helpful, and told me that if I did not like what I ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new. I work in the restaurant business (a much higher priced place) and this manager was awesome! Good job man!"
"2","I ordered some food to-go and my order wasn't right so I came back. The manager, alex I believe,was very understanding about the fact that I was upset about having to come back so he compensated for my time. This experience wont keep me from coming back. The food was good as usual"
"2","They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding)."
"1","Worst service! Ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a Sunday. Instead of being nice about it the girl told me I ordered it wrong but she would remake it for me."
"1","Wow. \nI called ahead to ask a few questions about what was going on with our bikes (we know how to fix up bikes for the most part but don't have a bunch of bicycle tools for when all the gear for your head tube is being funny, or your back hub is messed up). He told us to bring our bikes in for a free estimate and they'd more than likely be able to fix it without too much of a charge. I thought, hurray!\n\nMy girlfriend and I travelled by bus to get to this place (as we only have bikes). It took us about an hour (on a Sunday). We get there, he looks our bikes over, and says that it's going to cost $10 for a chain (reasonable) and $15 to put it on. Uhhhh, WHAT? You're telling me that you're going to charge me more than the actual chain to put it on, when if I had brought my little chain tool with me it would literally take me no more than five minutes to put the chain on? That was absolute BS.\n\nHe also said he was going to charge $25 to put a front brake on. Please tell me you are joking about that, too. I checked my watch to make sure it wasn't April 1st.\n\nThen after my girlfriend walked outside, I find out that they aren't even going to fix it today (when it in total would have taken them no more than 10 minutes). The hipsters response was, \""Uh, well I don't have the time to do it today. It's very labor intensive work.\"" It wasn't. At all. If I had the right bike tools it would have taken me about four seconds to rearrange the bolts for the front wheel.\n\nThey're rude. They're pretentious. And they think that I have no knowledge of bikes (simply because I brought the bicycle in), so they're incredible condescending. Not to mention up-charging the hell out of whatever they feel like.\n\nDon't go there. Ever.\n\nFind somewhere else to go.\n\nIf you really want an excellent deal and maybe learn a few things in the process, take your bike to Doug at Bikes International in Mesa. It's out of his home, but he took several classes on bicycle mechanics, worked in several bike shops, and now teaches classes on bicycle mechanics. For more info email him at bikesintl@netzero.com"
"2","I have brought my bike in for various reasons four different times and it has always been a solid experience for me. Once I brought our bikes in for a tuneup. I thought it was priced competitively and they did a fine job. In late 2011, I bought a helmut. The gentleman who assisted me was very helpful and also knew when to give me time on my own.  Recently I brought my bike in as I was riding home, because I kept getting flats on my back tire. Ron helped me and was very thorough. Not only did he fix the ongoing problem but he cleaned up my bike.  So I left with the problem completely fixed AND a shiny bike!  That's called customer service in my book-something sorely lacking in the US.   And I just brought it in again on Friday after a long ride because my odometer has not been working properly.  I thought they might be able to fix it for me. The tried but were unable to. Ron once again helped me. He sold me a very reasonably priced odometer that perfectly fits my needs. He did not oversell me. And because I didn't have enough cash on me, he allowed me to give him the cash I had on hand and call him to divvy up with my credit card when I got home. Yikes! I love this small business. Too bad I'm moving and won't be able to use them in the future."
"1","CLOSED!\n\nYou'll have better luck finding something to munch on at the Savers next door. Dust bunnies, anyone?"
"2","I feel like I have come full circle.  I started at this location 8 years ago.  Then Alisa was assigned to the Scottsdale location and of course, I had to follow her. Now she is back to the original spot, it is farther for me, but I will drive to bfe for her.  I cannot tell you how many times I get stopped at malls or on the street an inquired about my hair color.  Just yesterday I had a lady asking me if it was a single process hair color.  I told her it was not.  It requires the expertise of Alisa to make it look this natural.  When Alisa was on maternity leave the first time, I was impatient and I went somewhere else, and they left me brassy.  The second time Alisa went on maternity leave I wore a hat for a while."
"2","I have been coming here for years!  The prices are great and the owner is a gem!  (The rest of the staff is great too!)  Even though I haven't been in at least a year (I was flying on the east coast) she knew my name and remembered what I do and whatnot. ( I was never a regularly tanning person. I am generally very pale and usually just tan when I have a special occasion. Last time I was going often was my friends wedding 3 years ago....\n\nAnyway. She is amazing the prices are great and Its very hygienic.  According to previous reviews the beds are older. But I dont mind...  its not worth paying a lot more and going somewhere snooty...."
"2","Love it here! Great beds...always see amazing results! Staff is VERY knowledgeable and friendly! Good prices and a variety of lotions to chose from at any price point! Have been coming here for months and will continue! So happy to find such a great place so close home!!!"
"2","Great service!! They are the nicest people and run a wonderful business. This is by far the best dry cleaner I've found in the area. They really take care of my clothes and get out stains with ease. The turn around time is really quick too, and I have tendency to bring in a lot of clothes at once. Haven't gone anywhere else since I found Park Avenue Cleaners  almost 6 years ago.  Can't recommend them enough!"
"1","This place is definitely showing its age. It has withstood time in that it is still in operation, but it is in dire need of some serious renovation.\n\nThe \""warm room\"", which is the snack bar, is often a disaster area.\nThere is some sort of \""camp\"" for kids, which apparently meets up in the warm room. Then destroys it. Then leaves it like that.\nI paid $2.50 for a \""deluxe mocha\"", which was instant coffee, and powdered cocoa. How that constitutes \""deluxe\"" I'll probably never know.\nThere is no comfortable seating to be found anywhere.\nThe skates were considerably aged.\nOstensibly in an attempt to clear the condensation on the viewing glass (but failing miserably) there was a large fan blowing the cold air down toward the seating, just to ensure you weren't able to be warm at all. (Not a major problem the day I went, as it was approaching supernova temps outside)\nThere was actually a diaper on the floor in the \""warm room\"", that remained there for the entire duration I was at the rink, which was almost 3 hours.\n\nI would sooner pay the cost to go to the Ice Den. It is far cleaner, much more maintained, has comfortable seating, much more, and much better amenities."
"2","So I've been a pretty regular orderer from this Domino's. Over the years, I have had good and okay service with this Domino's. But, I have finally found the pizza that I love in everyway and I want to shout it from the mountain tops....It's a pizza that everyone should try. \nI started ordering their homemade pan pizza with spinach and ham and white sauce (indigestion kicks in with too much red sauce) and it is fabulous. Can't say it enough. You can choose any two toppings, but this pizza is perfect and their service has way improved lately."
"1","My fiance and I were vacationing to Arizona in June 2011.  We are not from the area so we like to get local recommendations and find some great places through yelp. After our awful experience here, I just had to sign up on yelp and tell everyone my our experience (do not disregard because I am new to giving my opinion on yelp).\nWe had no reservations but that doesn't mean you have to give us such a bad attitude when we asked for a table?  Yet, I think they gave us the worst table because we had no reservations?  Literally 2 mins after we were seated, they seated 2 older men right next to us and we might as well been a table of 4!  They were so close and so loud that we were part of their conversation.  How romantic.  The places wasn't even full and there were empty tables!\nNice selection of fresh made pasta...\nBut I ended up ordering a dish from their regular menu, Red Linguine Portifino with shrimps and scallops.  The sauce just ok and wasn't even that spicy. And what scallops?  There were barely any in the dish.  And the shrimps...are you kidding me?  They were tiny and with the full tail on which was like half the shrimp because they were so small.  I've been to many fancy italians restaurants and when I order an expensive past dish, I expect not to spend most my time picking the tail off with my knife and fork.  What a pain.  Funny thing is, then loud man sitting next to us order the same dish.  Instead of using his fork and knife, he simply put the whole shrimp in his mouth and used his fingers to pull the tail out.  How classy!!  \nI almost forgot to add, it was nice one of the chef's walked around and said hello and asked how everything was but if you are going to do that, why exclude CERTAIN tables?  Very rude.\nAll in all, for the expensive price we paid for dinner, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it!"
"2","Sadly, I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant.\n\nWe were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.\n\nThe Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!"
"1","The worst experience in my life. The menu is not clear and the waitress did a horrible job describing the ingredients."
"1","the really bad italian restaurant in Scottsdale, The chef is snubbing that he do not allow any people to change the side of the plate because he want you to force to buy extra pasta for $16.00 dollars. Please take care when you order the extra ugly and not flavors pasta it is expensive, the any dessert is over $ 15.00 and the bad Espresso is $ 5.00 dollars, I ate on the best Italian  restaurant in Dubai,London,Germany,Italy.But i never ate crap like this i  do not recommended this restaurant. I prefer Tomaso or Tutti santi by Nina ."
"1","Had a \""company\"" meal here. The foot was decent but I would not say outstanding. The chicken dela casa OK, the asparagus was cooked about perfectly but the dinner salad was pretty boring. --just lettuce and tomato, nothing else. The dressing was pretty bland too. I don't think I would return on purpose. The only really positive things I can say are 1. I did not have to pay because I was on company business and 2. It was better than Olive Garden"
"2","This place is a little hidden gem. The food was fantastic. A little bit of Italy in Phoenix. Everything we had tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. I'll be back!"
"1","My main course of the tortellini was delicious, that being said, everything else was bad. I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters. \nThey over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive."
"1","I was staying at the Pointe Hilton and figured to give this place a try after reading all the great reviews and seeing it was close.  I had the Chicken Al Momento , with salad and a cup of cream of  mushroom soup .  The salad was a balsamic vinigerette and it was pretty lame. It only came with one small tomato slice and no onions or pepperincinis like you get at many Italian Restaurants. The soup was ok and the Chicken Al Momento was ok , but it was served on a very small bed of spaghetti , I mean a box of pasta is about a buck and a half , put some more on the plate. The menu at this Phoenix location was very limited and being from Chicago I had higher expectations."
"2","This place is a home run every time!\n\nAlways a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.   \n\nTheir gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).  \n\nMy husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces \nachieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.\n\nFinally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal."
"2","Great donuts.  I think they are just a slight step below BoSa, but they are very good."
"2","5 stars all of the way!  The cute girl behind the counter recommended the maple bacon donut.  It was interesting and not bad by any means but it wasn't for me.  The apple fritter on the other hand!!!!!    It was amazing.\n\nI recently moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a good donut shop like I had at home.  I haven't even been able to find a good cake donut in this town.  I have been settling for dunkin donuts, safeway or frys crappy selection.\n\nI brought donuts in for the office and they were talked about all day.  I have a feeling I will be stopping by very soon to pick up more office goodies."
"1","My husbands back went out, so bad to the point he couldn't  stand on his own and would cry trying to sit up. He had gone to a chiropractor yesterday and they said he needed an MRI to confirm the severity.unfortunately he could physically get to a radiologist in time.   I decide to  take my husband to the ER because he coolant even go potty with out my help, I was really worried about him. \n\nFrom the moment i walked in , I asked the ER administrator for assistance getting my husband out of the car and I get this crazy nurse who is yelling at me that she is busy and doesn't have time. I felt like she was telling me to o away. So I asked if there was another hospital close by. Immediately they get two staff members to help.\n\nAfter being checked in and a nurse practitioner starts ridiculing my husband for coming to an emergency room for back pain and requesting an MRI. Every question my husband answered came with a sneer response back from the nurse. Finally I was livid at that point and asked his boss the RN, if we are wasting their time being here. I called another hospital that knew about the situation and welcomed us. \n\nEvery person we encountered was just miserable and it showed well. Never again. I will give my business with arrowhead health from here on out."
"1","I usually don't complain about Panda Express for yet the food is great and somewhat cheap. However this visit was disappointing. When my boyfriend and I walked in right from the start there was not enough food out and what was there was old and you can tell it must have been sitting  out there for some time. When we got our order the Orange chicken tasted dried out. Overall the food was old. Very disappointed."
"1","What a let down! Pizza was 15min late from the 40-45m pickup wait, staff was blah, and when I got home to try the pizza... Totally let down... And ps - the angry crayon written signs all over the place are soooo tacky."
"1","I know that this place is a cult favorite for East Coast pizza aficionados, but the experience is disturbing and the workers are less than friendly.  Plus, the place smells like an old grease pit.\n\nIf you have been stranded on Glendale on the corner of 12th street, and you must find a slice of pizza within the next 2 minutes Pat's is your place.  Otherwise, save yourself the reoccurring nightmare and go somewhere (really anywhere) else.\n\nStetson \""The Brand Man\"" Brandish"
"1","R.I.P. Pats Pizza. So sad we have lost our neighborhood eatery to self demise. After eating from Pats for years with an occasional disappointment my last 3 delivery orders have been inedible. Good Bye and RIP."
"2","I ordered 5 large pizzas for a party I had last weekend and they were great.  I popped in early in the day and placed my order.  The pizzas were hot and ready on time.  We got a variety of pizzas and they were really good.  The spicy chicken pesto was the biggest hit.  Totally perfect for the party.  All my friends were asking about the place I ordered from.  They have awesome wings too.  Plus, everyone that works there is so nice... the type of neighborhood place you always want to order from."
"2","I love this library for two very important reasons; free WiFi, Air Conditioning.\n\nI take my daughters to this location frequently, as there are plenty of in-house kids activities, plus we can check out movies and books for them, that I can still return when they're back home in CA.\n\nBut the summers, when the girls are here for an extended stay, this is our home away from home.\n\nWe will often ride our bikes down, and just hang out in the air conditioned comfort, playing games, or reading books. Sometimes the girls will do some computer-based activities, and I'll catch up on Facebook or Twitter, on my iPhone.\n\nOne of the things I love about Phoenix area libraries is the Culture Pass; you \""check out\"" a culture pass and get free tickets and admission to area museums, including the Heard, the Bead museum, etc.\n\nThere is plenty of parking, and several bike racks available.\n\nGo and check it out!"
"2","Great Restaurant! Large Portions and good food."
"1","I had a terrible craving for Mexican food the other night, and found myself in this complex doing miscellaneous shopping. So my son and I wandered over to this restaurant, having not been before, just recognizing the name. Walking in, it felt large and clean. It took a while to be seated, and when we did we were put in a corner booth. The waitress was nice, but short with her words. I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, and got my son the bean burrito kids meal. Food was just okay. I find myself only coming on here to write so so reviews, and maybe that's not fair as im picky! Probably due to being stuck in a corner booth, the waitress didn't check on us once, and I had to flag her down to get my bill. I suppose if you live in the neighborhood it would be okay to check out, but I wont be back. There are too many other authentic places in town to come here."
"1","idk...i've gotta say, i've had far better pizza than this.  i too was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  we got decent service, in fact our server was super nice and cute.  we split a salad that was simply lettuce and spinach with a tomato thrown in. the 5 bucks we spent on that could have purchased both 1 bag of lettuce and 1 bag of spinach.\n\nmy first glass of wine was corked and so much so that when i went to take a drink it burned my eyes but they were very nice about getting me a new glass of wine.\n\nnow on to the pie...  \n\nwe got the spinach special which came with a saccharin sweet sauce; personal preference would be a bit tangier but it was the grease and the crust that was the bummer.  when i get thin crust i like it to be crisp but this? not so much.  mush to the sogg town. \n\ncan't say that we will come back, there are just too many good pizza places in town."
"2","Ugh, some of the best pizza in town.  Just moved to the 'Slope in 2011 and this place has added a couple of pounds to me for sure.  Chicago style thin crust, square cut deliciousness.\n\nEver miss that smell that pizzerias used to have?  The kind that made you so happy and hinted that there would be a Pacman machine in a table top?  That's what this place makes me feel like.\n\nI LOVE the Spicy Italian specialty pizza, and even though it sounds weird, you just have to try the Spaghetti and Meatballs Calzone.  Ask for it with Ricotta, you'll thank me!"
"1","Sassy Glasses has one thing going for it; frame selection. \n\nIf there is another place in Phoenix that has comparable frame selection I am unaware of it. \n\nSassy Glasses falls short everywhere else however. The problem is Sassy Glasses is just a middle man. They do not make their own lenses, nor do they have their own doctors. And their optometry knowledge is, to say the least, limited. \n\nThey are good at helping you find the right style, but the doctors they send you to are sub par and if there is a problem with your lenses you will not be able to deal directly with the lens makers. \n\nThe bottom line is Sassy Glasses is good for people with minor vision issues who want to look \""hip\"" in their glasses, but people who need serious optometry services should look elsewhere."
"2","If I could award more than 5 stars for Sassy Glasses, I surely would.  In addition to having a funky selection of frames you won't find anywhere else, they have genuinely kind folks to help you out.  \n\nTry as many frames as you like until you find the ones you love, and they won't mind. They make every effort to get you into the right pair for YOU.  Conversely, even if you have fallen in loooove with a frame, they will tell you the hard truth if your prescription will look terrible in them.  Sad news indeed, but far better than taking delivery of a look that's not what you expected.  \n\nWe had shopped around prior to our visit and placed an order without hesitation.  Admittedly the interesting styles are more expensive, but Sassy Glasses' prices are not out of line with other optical boutiques of the same caliber.  They also have a number of selections that are priced near the upper end of what the chain stores might offer, but are oh so much more appealing.\n\nMuwah!!"
"1","$20 for two F@#$%&! FAXES!?!? OUTRAGEOUS RIP OFF. I feel wholly taken advantage of and I'm pissed off. Nobody bothered to warn me of pricing before sending anything. That is an ABSURD price."
"1","The atmosphere is decent, but the food is absolutely terrible.  It is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease.   The quesadillas are served in a pool of grease and the nachos are some of the worst in Phoenix,  The quality is an insult to the prices charged and an affront to good Mexican food.  Stick with the beer."
"1","We hadn't been here for several years and got a coupon so decided to try again for dinner .  First impression - DARK!   Seriously, so dark we can't read the menu (servers had to provide flashlights) and then could barely see our food.  Food was OK, but a bit pricey for what we got and service was a bit slow and sporadic.  We got a sopapilla for desert and it was strangely salty and sweet.  Overall, \""Meh\"" was our reaction.  Probably won't be back."
"1","I understand that this place is an old classic, but it seems more old than classic at this point.  It just feels dirty inside, the food is medium quality at very best and the service struggles.  They try hard, but it looks like the staff is on their own.  Probably my last visit unless there is a serious change."
"1","Disappointed in the food. The items we ordered were flavorless. Our orders were brought out wrong. Our server was seriously super slow. On the flip side the place is rather nice with a huge outdoor patio. Unfortunately, I do not foresee myself returning here."
"1","Attitude from the hostess\nOlives in the salsa\nDrinks not refilled!\nFood took 30 minutes to come out on a slow night.\nServer neglected us the entire time\nWe asked for the manager.. after waiting 10 minutes we decided to just pay and leave\nAnother 10 minutes for our check to come back. Still, manager never showed up\n\nI'll never go back again."
"1","I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted \""famous\"" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch. \n\nAllow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal. \n\nGranted, we came for the \""famous\"" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment. \n\nI had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not \""lightly\"" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!\n\nOne of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.\n\n \""The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination\"" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say \""aged\"") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers. \n\nFull disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted. \n\nTruthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return."
"2","Very happy with the work Ray and his team has done on my '07 BMW 328i.  With over 116K miles on my car it's good to have a shop I am comfortable with.  My car and I like Scott's Motor Werks."
"1","I do love the quick service and delicious food.  McNuggets are my guilty pleasure.  Today, I went and ordered a large iced tea unsweetened at the drive thru.  Another bonus is the $1 drink.  However, the tea was not fresh.  It was gross and I threw it away.  Shame on you for not keeping fresh tea on hand on a hot day!"
"1","I wish I could do negative stars. They are crooks! And liars! They will rape you any chance they can get and their customer service is a complete joke. Their website has incorrect information posted and everything I have ever tried to do with BofA has been a night mare. I wouldn't wish this bank on my worst enemy!"
"2","The staff is very friendly and they bring your drinks out to you.  The artwork and jewelry by local artists is usually quite good, and something I'd consider buying if I had the spare money.\n\nTheir coffee has a great taste, much better than Starbucks, and I like putting money into small businesses instead of the Wal-Marts of the coffee world.  They make my finicky customized orders with no issue and I always prefer to visit them rather than a Starbucks, but I have to hold a star back due to their pretty limited hours.  They close especially early on Sundays considering their line of business, so sometimes I end up having to hit the Starbucks anyway. :("
"2","First ill start off with saying my truck is currently getting repaired at Als this very moment and I will update my review as soon as I pick it up. What brought me into Als Unibody and Frame Repair shop. About 3 weeks ago i bought a 2003 Dodge Dakota in last week to have Al take a look at it. I bought the truck off Craigslist and got ripped off big time. Not only did I have to put $2,000 in repairs to the motor and tranny within not even a week of owning it, I found out after pressing my breaks hard and hearing a loud pop underneath my truck and it pulling hard to the right that my frame was pretty much cracked in half. The seller used bondo and paint to hide it. I took the truck in to 3 different auto collision center's and was turned down by 2 of them and the 3rd one estimated the damage to be at $3,500. I decided to do some more shopping and found some private welderd and was turned down by all 3. One of them recommended I take it to Al. Im glad I did. He put my truck on the lift and checked it over explaing everything in detail. After looking my truck over he said I would need a comple right side frame piece from another truck. He called several junk yards and got a few different prices and went with the that cost me less. When he showed md the estimate he wrote up  I thought there must have been a typo coming in a little over $2,000 less then what the other shop quoted me. Of course I went forward with the repairs I felt real comfortable leaving my truck in his hands. I never felt pressured into anything and I never got the feeling that he was \""in it for tge money.\"" Now with all that being said he definitely made a good first impression and as soon as I pick up my truck I will update this review and tell about my experience after repairs r done"
"1","Terrible experience with Dr Lersch and referral specialist. First time visit with Dr Lersch for 11 year old check up was okay. Everything since then, including spending hours on the phone following up on a referral, false promises to send to referral dr.s and finally a decision Dr Lersch would not support a referral to a speech therapist even though he diagnosed him as tongue tied. What a run around!"
"1","We have been coming here for years, loved the food and the ambience...until tonight. This was suppose to be a special night out for our daughter before she headed off to college. We decided to sit in the bar area..bad idea if you want to be served food quickly. We ordered our dinner at 6:00....at 6:35 our waitress came by to apologize for how long it was taking...apparently there was a private party with 60 people in the area next to us and the food was taking a while. That was a little hard to believe as there was a family of 5 sitting in the restaurant area who got bread and were served long before us...and we didn't get any bread. Our food finally arrived at 6:45. My daughter and I ordered the salmon, my husband-the steak. The salmon was supposed to have a citrus marinade..no citrus flavor was to be found, and it was very dry. My husband's steak was so over done and dry, he didn't even want to bring the leftover home to our dog. We expressed our disappointment to the waitress-who was very nice and apologized..she mentioned the chef is new and we are not the first people to complain about the food. We did get a small discount for the meal, but unfortunately, will not be back."
"1","I must say... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life. \n\nBoy oh boy, what a disappointment !!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.\n\n\""10mn ? Not a problem !\"", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAnd we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment.\n\nI wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the $ we paid. \n\nThey brought the perfunctory \""amuse gueule\"", which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit.\n\nAt this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife.\n\nThey then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting.... (but come on,... how hard is it to screw up bread??).\n\nWe perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white)... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving... which was a plus...\n\nAs a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better)... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread... quite nice... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders.\n\nMy wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte... one piece of advice... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder,  with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese.... For 11$, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success... however, he did later take it off the bill.\n\nMy wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy.  What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy.... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries... yuck.\n\nI however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. \n\nNo dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.\n\nNet/net: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide...."
"1","The view for this place is nice and their food tasted not too bad but the price just doesn't justify what you get. They have some of the smallest portions I have ever seen for a pretty penny. The waiter I had was a bit of a prick and I was forced to pay him basically a 40% tip. I dined in a party of 6 and they add a service charge on top of a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. It's ridiculous and so not worth going to. I'm from LA so seeing overly priced food with so so service doesn't get high marks from me. I won't be coming back. You're really just paying for the view. I am so disappointed with this place."
"2","My husband and I committed to trying a rare, expensive restaurant on each anniversary. This year, we were led to A Different Pointe of View. Everything was special and delicious, just as one would hope for a celebratory occasion. A welcome surprise was the service provided by Luis. He gave the right amount of suggestions for courses, wine and timing - all with a sense of humor one would not expect from such a fine restaurant. (At one point, he compared himself to Cesar Milan.) We shared the Short Ribs Ravioli and Steamed Cedar Creek Clams as 2 courses, at Luis's suggestion. It felt so European! My husband savored the Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin, while I especially enjoyed Luis's suggestion of Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak. The both proteins were some of the most tender I've ever tasted. The hanger steak was a thin serving and the perfect portion. To end, we chose a Midnight Espresso Cup, but Luis also brought us the creme brulee, too. As he said, \""You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee.\"" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it. My one complaint: the clam broth was underseasoned. Seems like small potatoes to me."
"2","I had my first experience here last Friday night. The service and food was excellent. Things started out a bit shaky as they had a very loud wedding party in the dining room and I was concerned it would ruin the evening. Luckily they left about 20 minutes after our arrival and the rest of the night was perfect.\nI am a fan and I will go again!"
"1","Good view with bad breath waiter! The view is great but I expect a lot more than just a view from a restaurant trying to be the high end of restaurant. The service was poor and our waiter was just awkward (oh and he had horrible breath).\n\nThe food was ok but not great. For a restaurant that charges the high end prices I expect high end service & high quality food. My girlfriend and I both ordered the filet and they were both slightly over cooked but not enough to send them back. It was my girlfriends birthday so they were nice enough to bring out a free dessert but they should have asked me if it was something we liked first because it was not. I would have rather paid for a dessert that we both enjoyed.\n\nSo in summary, the view is A+ along with a romantic setting, food below average for what i expect & service was poor."
"2","This place has stunning views! The downside is the parking although they are providing a valet service. If you are looking to impress someone, this is the place."
"1","This isn't the worse place I've been. In fact the pedicure was really pretty good, but the manicure chipped the very next day! They aslo gave me a kind of hard time about paying with card, even though i tipped in cash. I only went here for a wedding and i don't think I'll be going back."
"1","This place is one of the WORST nail salons I have been to. Horrible color selection, rude staff and plain and simple junk job.  The owner Wendy did my girlfriend pedicure and cut her skin, when she said it hurt she squirted a mystery potion on which stung but hopefully disinfected...gross.  i wanted to go somewhere else and have a new pedicure done when I left!  Not to mention they changed the prices last minute.  Dont waste your time or money on this dump.  Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."
"1","Ready for the creepiest customer service story ever?????\n\nThe other day I had a not so great gel polish job there; kind of sloppy around the edges, a few little bumps and bubbles, etc. My tech clearly could not understand much English. The rate had been agreed when I came in: $20. When I went to pay at the front,  I said to the owner, Wendy, that I was not thrilled with how it looked, but I had to leave for school pickup. She said,   \""OK, five dollar off.\"" So I handed over $15.  She said, rudely, \""No! You owe twenty! Extra for taking off your old polish!\"" I said that no, we had agreed on the price when I arrived and she saw that my nails needed polish removal.\n\nThat was when she GRABBED my cell phone from off the counter and said, \""You pay twenty or I keep your phone!\"" (!!!!!!!!) I calmly said to please give me my phone, I would pay her. After she handed it back, I said, \"" You cannot change the price after the service. I am not even happy with this, but I have still paid you. Goodbye.\""  No insults, no profanity, no yelling. I was holding her business card in my hand, and she grabbed roughly from my hand and crumbled it into a ball. (!!!!!) I had a few singles I had planned to walk back and give to the tech, but I was getting kind of nervous and upset.\n\n\nAs I turned to go, she ran out in front of me and STEPPED ON MY FOOT! This caused me to lose my balance and my flip flop went spinning across the floor, and she kicked it even further. (!!!!!) Plus,  there were a few other customers in pedicure chairs watching, and I said, \""Do you really want to do this? Assault a customer who has just paid you? Really?\"" Then another worker went up to her and spoke in Vietnamese, and she glared at me and said, \"" I call police on you! \"" I said to go ahead! She would be the one in trouble. But I was actually scared she was going to strike me!\n\nSo I fled, heart pounding, with nails that look sub par. I would never return, obviously. Wendy should be ashamed of herself. That's  a pitiful way to run a business."
"1","When I went, my male manicurist took two smoking breaks in the middle of doing my nails! And then when I went back and got the same guy, he didn't even massage my shoulders?!? WTF?! The service was just outright horrible and I will never come back here again. The only reason I went back the second time in the first place was with a friend and her mother--unexpectedly to this place. Would not recommend."
"2","This place is consistently rated one of the top two or three salons in the state, which is probably what drew my sister and mom there to begin with. Being a totally oblivious male when it comes to things like this, I usually just go with recommendations from friends or family. What was surprising was that it has all the chic trendiness of the upscale places, which ding patrons for 60-75$ per male cut, but at less than half the price. \n\nI have gotten cuts from Myriah, Rae Lyn, and Lucy and they all have done great jobs. They all were able to take what I instructed (for example, once it was, \""I'm shooting for Dr. McDreamy. Go!\"") and I'm always pleasantly surprised. Good conversation, nice people, and no snobby feel like at most spots like it."
"2","I've been going to Salon Surreal for about a year now. I get my waxes done there, and am totally in love with Kari!!! Those back rooms are great, and relaxing. I've gotten a facials and micro-dermabrasions done as well, all of it well worth the time and money I spent! \n\nI also have my hair done now by Nichole, who is new to the salon, but \nsuper sweet!! She's actually going to be doing my hair and the bride's hair for my brother's up coming wedding! And from what I've heard of her other formal 'do's she's amazing, so I'm very excited about that. \n\nNo matter what you're looking for this salon and spa has what you need! And if you're not sure, give them a call and the receptionists can give you a recommendation! \n\nI love the decor of the place, it's appealing to the eye (if you know what to look for) and it's classy. I would say it's the best mixture of an upscale salon and a place I could go just to hang out. \n\nEveryone that works there is nice and their personalities run the spectrum!! Some are sweet and soft spoken while others are boisterous and outgoing. The one thing I would never say is that this salon is anything like a factory. It's functionality and flowing set up allows clients to be the center of their stylists, esthetician, or nail techs attention. Each person there brings their own personality and pop! to their area but is by no means cluttered. \n\nI would recommend this salon to anyone visiting the Phoenix area!! They have fabulous male and female stylists, massage therapists, estheticians, and nail techs!!!!"
"1","I really wanted to like this salon. After the reviews I read, I was expecting a really upscale salon. While the iced tea served there is good, I diddnt think they would bring it to me in a tiny styrofoam cup. I used to go to Rolfs. But wanted a change. I explained this to the receptionist that I am in bad need of a new look. I tried to book my appointment with Bobby, but he was on vacation. So I asked who was good with coloring brunette hair and she told me Rachel. I arrived early because after reading reviews I thought parking would be a nightmare. I had no problem parking and there were many spots available.\nRachel was a doll. She had an awesome personality. And after I told her I really wanted a change, there wasnt much hair cut off at all. The color was beautiful when I left the salon, but the red washed out within 3 days. I was very dissapointed. Also I saw other stylists giving the neck massages forever! However, I diddnt get any such treatment. The only time I got in the sink was to quickly wash the color out.\nI do not love the cut. When I spend that much money on a salon visit. I think I should LOVE it. I will not be returning to the salon. But for those of you who wish to, there is a 20 percent off coupon on arizonaspagirls.com"
"2","Since my first appointment with Brandi three years ago, I won't let anyone else near my hair.  Best highlights ever, and great cuts from short to long and back again.  I have recurring goth phases too, so I appreciate that she doesn't condemn me for being a child of the 80s.  ;o)\n\nThe place is friendly and hip and pretty competitive in their pricing, considering that it gets such rave reviews.  I can't help but notice the lack of haughtiness.  This is a milder version of swank.  Everyone's really friendly (they even feed me tea & cookies), and when I was finally brave enough to treat my hopelessly imperfect body to that first bikini wax, I was really glad I did it here.  Highly recommended!"
"1","This was the place to be! back in 1983 now time has been harsh to this place. Maintaince issues and rough edges detract from this place.\n\nCeiling  lights missing their covers, Tiles on the outdoor baseboards falling off and covered in over spray from a cheap paint job. Staff wearing tuxedo like clothing that on paper looked good but in reality was wrinkled and a thin facade.\n\nThe food here too lacked any unique presentation or flavor. The bar did seem to have decent prices, and to add to the class the urinals in the restroom have cup holders so you can bring that drink with you."
"1","My garage door opener died a few weeks ago. This company came out and replaced a part. Was working for 4 days. Then died again. They came out a second time and fixed it again. It broke down 3 days later, same issue. Called for a 3rd time and was told a tech was coming. They didn't show. Mix up in the office apparently. Rude receptionist didn't want to make things right and said a tech may come in 3 days. Techs were nice. Who knows whats up with my garage door opener. But geez...horrible customer service. Note: my home warranty company chose this company. I did not. Having someone else come tomorrow."
"2","This may be the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food I've ever had.\n\nI found this place on Yelp after searching for Mexican restaurants in the Sunnyslope area, and was expecting a lot after all the rave reviews. My boyfriend and I have been there for dinner twice now, and attempted a third time but arrived too late because I forgot that they close at 8pm :( One of the only negative things about the place so far. I think they should stay open until at least 9PM, but oh well.\n\nI've read numerous comments about poor service but both times I've been, service has been just fine. Maybe a little on the slow side regarding the check, but I can let that slide as I was not in a hurry to leave either time. The ambiance is not romantic or necessarily inviting, but it's charming in its own way.\n\nI found it a little strange that they charge for chips and salsa ($1), but it's a small price to pay, as the chips were very fresh and the salsa (both the salsa served with the chips, and the bottled hot sauce) was quite good. I think both times I've eaten at El Bravo, I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner special served with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, tomato and rice and beans on the side. The chimichanga was AMAZING. Flavorful, juicy, tender shredded chicken and a very fresh and crispy flour tortilla. The toppings were a little overwhelming, next time I may ask for them on the side. The rice and beans both had good flavor and I was very satisfied with the whole meal. I thought the little crispy flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar which was brought with the check was a very nice way to end the meal.\n\nEl Bravo is a little nondescript and can be easy to miss while looking for it, but it's totally worth it!"
"1","I liked that they offer respray if you find critters within 21 days of spray, but after 3 months of service, have had to have re-sprays EACH month. Paying extra to treat for scorpions and there are now scorpions galore and worse than prior to exterminating...\n\nAnd to make matters worse, they give a 2-3 hour window to be home and twice now, have not met that window or bothered to call to let me know they were not going to make their time slot, leaving to to reschedule and play the \""wait around for the bug guy\"" all over again.\n\nDo yourself a favor and find a more reliable company."
"2","I have used Lee Collins for AC issues for the past three years. They are always thorough, prompt & very reasonably priced. They just left my house after I called them early on a Saturday morning, here within just a couple of hours & issue repaired immediately! They will always have my business!"
"1","I ordered a pizza and salad for delivery from GrubHub. While my delivery showed up on time, my order was wrong. The pizza was missing 2 of the toppings I was charged for and was under-cooked. Additionally my salad came with the wrong dressing. The experience was disappointing. It's the small things that make a difference and Streets of New York dropped the ball tonight."
"2","i love, love, love the high level of customer service that paul and his staff provide at central car care.  i recommend them to all my friends.  good service, nice people, great prices, reliable.....  what more can you ask for?"
"2","Got me in and out fast, inexpensive, and friendly."
"1","I'm sitting in a pedicure chair now. I called for an appointment for a pedicure and manicure at the same time since I am on lunch. They said sure come at 12.  Got here at 12 and they said they can't do them both at the same time. One after another. I said no I am on lunch, that's why I called.  So I said fine just pedicure.    They have been chit chatting in some language for the past 20 mins and my pedicure is barely even started.  So rude.  If they would stop talking and screaming across the room- maybe they could get more done."
"2","So, I am new to the Sunnyslope area and work nearby. Choices when you have a half hour lunch are pretty slim around here. We have Jack in the box, McD's and a Subway. I had never seen this little place because it's so well hidden. A friend who lives in the area recommended I try their sandwiches. Since I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things I walked on in. The deli is quite the interesting little place. Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark. They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home. The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza (sold by the slice) and spaghetti. I settled on a salami sub. Wow, I have never realized a sub can taste SO good!! The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub. While waiting for my sub to be prepared I did grab an orange Italian ice from the freezer. Once at work, I found it had no taste. It was just orange colored ice. All in all, great experience! Can't wait to try some more sandwiches!"
"1","Good selection, usually helpful people working out in the plants, but customer service falls apart when you get to the counter--very slow. Bought a 15G tree last time, paid for planting, which was all fine initially. However, the tree lost nearly all its leaves within a couple weeks. We called them and they told us not to be concerned. Well, we waited for the tree to recover but it ultimately died; so called them back (now a few months later). They scheduled someone to come out to \""check it\"", but they were a no-show for the scheduled appointment. Called again, and the run-around started. NOW they needed an invoice number (provided) and were supposed to call back. No call back. Called again to check; no call back. Called to complain--no call back. We've just given up, on getting this tree replaced, as well as ever going back to Whitfill. Buyer beware."
"1","My dog ended up here after being hit by a car (I was on vacation and someone was watching my dog for me) , because it was the closest option.\nLong story short , I felt ripped off.\n\nThe review by Mike W. is very familiar to me. I was misled , and  they were performing procedures just to increase the final bill. After 2 weeks in their \""care\""  my dogs condition deteriorated and my dog had to be put down. \n\nI do not want to relive the experience emotionally so I'm keeping this short."
"1","I thought Gallagher's was a sports bar?  I had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare ASU baseball broadcast on national TV.  I arrive first, and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the many TVs present.  (I'm sure none of the other 3 people in the bar were watching Jeapardy).  Another patron (one of 3 already there) had asked previously, he told me later, only to be shot down by the manager.  So then I asked if I could actually listen to the game, too?  No such luck.  Did I mention this was the home-town ASU baseball team, nationally ranked, fighting for their post-season?  And a sports bar opts to play 80's hits, instead?  I quickly called BS on that, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived, we left.  If you want a \""sports bar\"" near Squaw Peak, I suggest trying 16th St. Sports Bar n Grill, instead.\n\nI've been to many Suns games and other events at Gallagher's, so I assumed they would have a local sports team on tv with audio.    The food is OK, the prices are a bit steep for pub-grub.  When I was there, a Monday during happy hour, there were about equal number of wait staff to patrons, and it still took 10 minutes to get a drink.\n\nI'm very disappointed in the service, and the lack of understanding by the management.   The food isn't enough to get me back, and the prices are higher then average.  I'd give it less then one star, if I could."
"1","Normally I love this place but today management failed. They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons. Its not like the Derby came as a surprise.\n\nNever coming back for a special event here. I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience. Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again."
"2","Haven't ate here in years due to location but decided to have hubby pick this up for dinner last night.\n\nMu shu pork- amazing!\n\ncrab Rangoon's- Amazing\n\nChix and broccoli- pretty good broccoli a little mushy\n\nReally enjoyed dinner! check it out for some good eats"
"1","The Saturday after breaking my liver and recovering from a hangover, I decided that pizza sounded great! I love supporting non-chain establishments, the mom and pop shops of my hood. I decided to order a pizza from Stumpy's. \n\nMeh. It wasn't awful, it wasn't inedible, but it didn't knock my socks off. The sauce was a little plain and I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got just enough cheese to cover the sauce.  I am willing to try Stumpy's again because the service is so friendly and the pizza is prepared right in front of you. Maybe I should start with a plain pepperoni before going into the sausage and onion realm. Maybe I got a little crazy on my first trip. No...I don't think so, but I'm willing to give them another shot."
"1","I'm staying at the squaw peak resort and had a free breakfast voucher for this place. I waited for 15 minutes. No waiter. Finally flagged one down and ordered an omelette. Nothing fancy. 20 minutes later no omelette. Finally flagged the waitress down an said I had to leave. She said she would put it in a box for me and went to the kitchen. Three minutes later, still no waitress. No box. I walked out hungry. Went back for lunch. It was a big mistake. almost no customers there as we arrived at 11:10 am. It took FOREVER. Fifty minutes later my fish tacos arrived. Not once did my water get refilled. No one asked me how my lunch was. I'm never coming back. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
"1","My boss asked for a referral for an interior designer to decorate our new office building so I reached out to the Yelp community and got turned on to Neilsen. I sent all the contact info on to my boss and she was thrilled that I had a referral for her so quickly! Brownie points for me! \n\nNosomuch. While Nielsen might be extremely talented, his follow through and time management were less than adequate. He wouldn't return my boss' phone calls without her leaving him several messages, was 2 weeks late turning in his proposal, and would go out of town for weeks at a time without letting her know he was gone....I could go on and on, but really, I don't want to re-live the embarrassment again. \n\nI know there is the chance that perhaps there were some crossed circuits here, especially since there are so many positive reviews, but honestly, something was amiss with this experience and that's why the low marks (I don't give a lot of low marks normally and it pains me to do so).\n\nI'm not saying don't use this company, because they are probably extremely talented, but I would evaluate the situation you're in before you recommend them to someone so you don't end up in the same predicament I am in."
"1","Because of this Blockbuster..Im now a NetFlix member.. EVERYTIME since Ive moved to N. Phoenix that I have been a paying.. yes, paying customer, you Blockbuster managers.. I have had or witnessed an issue at this place.. scratched movies.. once I get them home.. just to go back and not even get an apology.. wow! you gave me a free movie.. the same one and you act like you did me a favor?! Ugh.. and the attitude and unprofessionalism of the peeps working there.. I mean.. seriously, people.. DONT yell across the store to ask if it was inventoried.. no manners here , whatsoever.. and does the line of people really care that you were completely drunk last weekend.. as you tell your coworker.. No.. we think your an immature slob.. and what the h is that burping sound from the supply room.. Oh wow! ITs a burping coworker.. fantastic"
"2","The Flamingo Palace is my favorite Asian food restaurant.  A great family atmosphere but also a great place for date night.  Great food at a great price, Check it out if your in the area!!"
"2","Finally found a Chinese restaurant in my hood! \n\nWe've ordered take out 4 times within the last 2 weeks if that give you any idea of how much I like this place. I don't know how, but the takeout food is still HOT once you get it home and start making your plate. I personally love this, because who wants to nuke something 20 mins after picking it up? Not meeeee. \n\nQuick service - take out was FAST and the restaurant was packed. Reasonable prices 7-12 range for dinner. LARGE servings (1 order of Cashew Chicken can be 2-3 meals for me. My husband more like 1-2 meals). \n\nWe've been happy with everything we've ordered. Flamingo chicken is my hubs favorite, but we've also done chicken fried rice, egg friend rice, beef & broccoli, kung pao chicken and cashew chicken (mentioned above) and its all awesome. Except the Kung pao - but that's probably my fault because I asked them to not make it super spicy, as I'm not a fan and it was lacking flavor in general. (but like i said probably my own fault.) \n\nCan't wait to try more!"
"2","It has taken me a while to find a good dentist in this city and now I must say I have found the best dental office in Phoenix (.) Dr. Ortale and his staff are very friendly and outgoing. \nThey are honest and straight forward, plus Dr. Ortale does wonderful work your smile will look better than ever, not to mention all the good music he plays in the clinic...not your boring elevator music that's for sure.  My wife and son also loves the office who just started up as new patients. \nLife long loyal patient :)"
"2","Shawn Eric has provided wonderful magic and entertainment for two private events this past year. \nEveryone loved it as usual. He has a wonderful talent, personality and always is making people happy and amazed. This expressions on the kids & adults faces are priceless!\nYou have amazed and bewildered us all !\n\nThank you again!\nJessica Moore Aikin"
"1","ok, let me be straight with you. i hate paying full price for anything. yes, i'm one of those people. i love a coupon. i love a discount. and i absolutely love a bargain! but i don't like to feel dirty when i leave a store. i felt really, really dirty when i left this store. ewwwwww. this is a yucky ross. dirty, dirty, dirty! the floors and clothing racks were filthy. i couldn't have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross - i got black \""stuff\"" on my hand after touching a clothing rack. the floor was so discolored i'm not sure what the original color was. parts of the store's floor were sticky. many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them, presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on. selection was meager, there wasn't a single shoe, bag, wallet, sock or home decor item that caught my eye. the trip was a waste of an hour that i'll never get back. never, ever again."
"2","To quote my previous review: \n\""I'm calling this 3.75 Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask. \""\n\n==\nWell, I didn't get my Mango Sticky Rice, but the Saturday boofay contained a few items not there during weekday lunch, including a wonderful Thai Custard Tart with Apple slices and a seasonally updated version of the fruit salad with tons of ripe mango, strawberry, and pineapple.\n\nThe hot line had a few extras as well.  There were more seafood dishes than during the week,  a unique thai 'salsa' with diced green/red peppers and avocado, and a new crispy tofu number I hadn't ever seen before.\n\nI also got to experience the same level of friendly, attentive service I've grown to expect, but from a completely different set of staff.\n\nConsistency like this points to a very well run establishment.\n\nSo since I promised I'd do it, 4.75 stars!"
"1","Pizza was ok , personally I thought it would blow my mind but it tasted a little better than frozen pizza. And the hot Wings were disgusting , they were literally stone cold and some were hot. It like they were frozen for a month and left in the hot sauce , really dry wings. Never coming back... Btw the guy who answers the phone is not very friendly at all when asking for specials and sounded very annoyed when I called."
"2","I've been going to this pizza place for fifteen years. I use to live in the neighborhood and would visit weekly. I now visit every few months. Best sauce ever!"
"1","I took a pair of shoes to this place.  It was a simple repair, they just needed the straps glued back in.  I was shocked when I went in and there were display cases of watches and only old shoes in sight.  It looked like a fence for something.  I showed him my shoes and he told me the only thing he could do was staple the straps on the outside.  The shoes are Steve Madden Juke and it would have change the entire look.  He informed me that was the look now.  Um no, I'll try somewhere else and left.  I took them to another shop and the owner glued them and fixed them for me for $15.  Would never go back to this place, not even if I were shopping for a watch."
"1","I hate to rain on the love parade for this place, but my husband and I went last night for pedicures.  I called earlier in the day and MADE APPOINTMENTS.  When we got there we waited 20 minutes to even get to the pedi chairs.  My husband waited another 10 minutes before a technician even started with him.  During the service she cut his toe!  The upside of his service was that she gave an amazing leg and foot massage.  \n\nNow back to my experience.....basically my service didn't begin until 25 minutes AFTER I got seated in the pedi chair (did I mention we had appt. for 5pm)!  45 minutes after our stated appointment time, I finally saw my technician.  Unfortunely we had dinner reservations and had to leave in a limited time, so I basically got shafted on the massage!\n\nThe staff was apologetic about the timing, but first impressions are a killer.  I really don't think we will be going back.\n\nSorry Biagio:("
"1","Our AC went out last Saturday in 102 degree heat - called the 'emergency number' and never got a response.  Tried to call the number on Sunday and again, no one called us back.  Makes me wonder if they even check the number.  It took several calls on Monday to even reach a person in the office.\nIt took 6 days to get the AC 'fixed', only to have it break the next week - at the start of the fourth of July weekend.  Its now 110 degrees outside, Let's take bets on how long it takes for them to fix it this time.\nJust tried the emergency number, but I don't even expect a response...\n\n6 days to fix a major emergency I my home, by the end of this second issue, we will be almost two weeks without AC- but let me be late on my rent one day and see how much they charge me.\n\nRidiculous"
"1","My GF and I went to Joey's after driving by it for years, but never taking the plunge.  To say we were shocked when we stepped insided was a mucho understatement-o.  The fucker was empty.  It was a wednesday night,  and it was kinda early (6:30pm)  but I expected more than just us and the smattering of blue hairs that were seated. \n\nI don't wanna come off as an ass hat; the staff was super friendly, but this  place was downright C R E E P Y - some would say the decore inside was dated , I'd say  it felt like I was sitting in my grandma's living room.  The lights were off in half the restuarant ( that's not good) , and the A/C  was on the fritz . (or they don't believe in a/c?)   It wasn't swelteringly hot inside, but whaterver cooling system they had running could not keep my swamp ass at bay :(   \n\nLastly, the the food. While hot and ressembling standard issue italian chow, was off in a \""alternate dimension kinda\"" way.   Like a Bizzaro Pizza.  Yeah.   I  felt oogy after I ate it.   Avoid the regular ice tea, it's olive flavored. olive."
"1","Wow, this place is certainly empty for a reason!\nThe meat in our entrees was way over cooked, or perhaps cooked days before and reheated?  The quality of the food was very poor in comparison to the prices on the menu.  But actually, I would have returned my dish even if I was at a fast food restaurant...which is where I headed after leaving.  \nThe bruschetta was good, and the place was clean but this is about all of the positive comments that I can make on Joey's California Bistro.  Too bad, I really wanted to like it."
"1","My friend and i drove 25 miles to get to a yoga class at 2:00pm, we get there 5 minutes late and they did not let us in.  We did all we could to get there on time and the lady at the front desk asked us to leave and to arrive on time next time.  \n\nI asked her since we drove such a long way to come to this place can we get in?  She still said no.  I felt so hurt at all the effort we put in.  She was looking at us funny because I am Mexican and my friend is Black.  We have both practiced yoga for a while now.\n\nSince then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends."
"2","THE BEST YOGA STUDIO IN PHOENIX, HANDS DOWN!\n\nWhy?\n1. Quality Teachers\n2. Dedication to authentic yoga\n3. Supportive community environment\n4. Variety of styles\n5. Yoga teacher training/advanced studies program\n\nI've been doing yoga for more than 15 years, and have tried many studios in the valley. Yoga Pura, by far, is the best studio in town for an authentic experience of yoga.\n\nI particularly enjoy Eric's classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is a certain focus and concentration, as well as a the overall feeling of peace I experience during his classes that I just can't get anywhere else. He teaches yoga as a discipline for creating peace and happiness in his students' lives...not just fluffy stretching.\n\nSome of my other favorite classes include Nyla's Level 1 & 2 and essentials,  Rachel's essentials class, and for a good restoration class, check out Laura. I also absolutely LOVE the Yoga Nidra (guided meditation) offered here. Nidra is really hard to find in town, and YP is one of the few places that actually trains teachers in the practice of Nidra. \n\nRegardless of what your looking for...hatha, flow, power, gentle, restorative, meditation...whether you are new or an experienced practitioner, you will find something here that suits your practice style. My best advice to you is to try different teachers and different classes. \n\nOnce you start coming here, you may never stop! If you come regularly, you will undoubtedly make friends. It's so nice to come to class and see people I've met over the years. The community at YP is definitely one of the things that makes it so special.\n\nLastly, yet most importantly.... \n\nYoga is about realizing your limitless potential and releasing from the suffering of the mind. It does this by bringing you into alignment with your \""true self\"" and freeing your mind from the lies it tells itself. I always knew that yoga made me feel better. But it wasn't until I started practicing with Eric at Yoga Pura that i started to understand why. This lead me to take YP's Yoga Teacher Training and Advanced Studies program in 2011. It was by far THE BEST thing I have done to improve my life. And for that, I will be eternally grateful to Eric, YP teachers and the YP community.\n\nBut don't take my word for it...Test it out for yourself. They offer 3 free classes for newcomers. ENJOY!"
"2","The best place for a real manicure. And a fun place to spend part of your day."
"1","This was my second visit to this location. I received a lot of food for my money but the food is just okay... I love Mexican food and this place is just cranking it out without any real quality. The service was fine and I did not think it took long to wait for my food. I'm passing on this one."
"2","My family loves to come here for family fun days. It is newly remodeled and with lots of TVs with sports and cartoons. Every time we go it is very clean. The atmosphere is very friendly and the pizza is good too. They have tons of new games and they were all in working order."
"1","Just had the most frustrating experience I have ever had at any shipping location.  All we wanted to do was ship a package from Phoenix to Chicago.  The person we talked to had no idea how the process works or any suggestions to help us ensure the package would arrive next day.  When we inquired about sending it to a FedEx location instead of the home address to ensure someone could pick it up, she was absolutely no help in finding a FedEx location anywhere close.  She just wanted to say here computer would not let her search locations.  Really, you can't search FedEx locations from a FedEx????  We asked about Saturday delivery and she had no idea how that worked or what would happen to the package if it couldn't be delivered on Friday.  She wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package.  It was almost like she couldn't hear because she paid no attention to the questions we were asking.  We finally get a price and it is outrageous and she quotes a time different than what we filled out on the slip.  I came home and found a FedEx location very close to where we were trying to ship the package in about 60 seconds on the FedEx site.  We were quoted $160+ for overnight.  Per the FedEx site we got a quote for $110 using generous measurements.  We also got a quote for $77 for Saturday delivery which the store person couldn't even come close to figuring out.  Ultimately we took the package to UPS and shipped for Saturday delivery at $75, less than half of the only option the clerk could come up with.  I have shipped thousands of items with FedEx, UPS, USPS etc. and you do have to ask questions or you can be disappointed.  This gal clearly has not been trained and I don't have enough time to do their job for them.  We were there 30 minutes and finally left because we couldn't get anywhere.  Ultimately we also saved $85 or more than half so the extra hour to get it all done was worth it.  That will be the last time I use this FedEx."
"2","Major Upgrade to this gym!"
"2","I'm definitely not a fan of the customer service, but the place has gotten pretty sweet after the remodel. (the ellipticals have TVs on them, and iphone/ipod hookups for charging while working out and using it)  The store next door went out of business or something, so they opened that up and and put the weight equipment in there.  They bought a whole bunch more elliptical and stationary bikes, and now it's quite a bit more cardio.  I'm kinda proud of them for it, honestly.  \nParking can be a little rough during the crowded hours, but if you don't mind walking a few extra rows, you'll be okay."
"1","Though staff seems friendly, they are not knowledgeable about shipping valuable things, how insuring a package works and completely overpriced. \n\nI used their services to ship a sewing machine. They charge $25 to put it in a box and wrap it with bubble tape.  I was charged $136 for postage and insurance (though not enough insurance to cover the machine if it broke while shipping because she didn't know how).  I felt that I was paying way too much but was in a time crunch so I accepted and left (did not get an actual copy of any shipping forms because she said she had to keep all copies including the one that says \""customer copy\""). \n\nOnce my package arrived my feeling of being overcharged was confirmed.  Of the $136 I paid for postage and insurance, it only really cost $77 to send. Upon contacting the owner, I was told there was no error and the +75% markup was the retail price because they have no affiliation with UPS and thats how they earn money to stay in business.  Had I taken my package to the US Postal Service  up the street at Cave Creek I would have gotten better service and paid over $50 LESS for my shipment. \n\nI would give this store 1 STAR because of my experience and feeling that they are extremely overpriced and \""shady\"". I gave it 2 STARS however because the item that I sent, did arrive in 1 piece and in the amount of time I was promised. Just feel bitter that I was so severely overcharged for their services. \n\nWon't do business here again. Would recommend using the USPS or the UPS store at Bell and 32nd St - haven't had any issue there before."
"1","Would give a zero, this Indian lady wants to talk on the phone more then help customers and was quick to say \""my computer is down\"" popcopy!"
"1","Thoroughly disappointed in their business practice. The sign said $79, I said I'll buy it, a guy comes up and says we have the footboard in the back. Next lady changed the price to $299. They raised the price nearly 40% right in front of me after I already said I would buy it for the listed\nPrice. Shady business!"
"1","We decided that Tutor Time was just too expensive and their policies SUCK so we decided to switch and heard good and bad things about Susies Mama Bear. We looked at a few places and for the price ($33 a day) we decided to try them out!\n\nThe facilities arent state of the art, they arent very large and the school is kind of tucked away but none of that bothered us in the least. My son is 18 months and as long as he has fun and is safe thats all we cared about, besides the place isnt a dump.\n\nWe have been going for 2 weeks now and have already decided to pull our son out. When my girlfriend picked him up last week the person was changing his poopy diaper and left poop on his butt, then when my GF told her and asked her to wipe it up she was given attitude and a smirk! Everytime you go and pick up your child you are given a \""security\"" coin that you give to the teacher to get your kid, when my GF gave the teacher the coin she said \""whats this?\"".....really....\n\nThe next time she dropped him off she asked what they were going to do today and the teacher said \""I dont know I wasnt given the schedule yet\"". We drop him off later, around 9-10 usually.  My GF tried talking to management and they didnt seem to do much, though we were only there 2 week maybe thats not long enough for them to implement change or maybe it was just one complaint and they dont do anything until they get 5, I dont know. \n\nSo I dont know if they are between teachers or if we just caught them in a bad time or what is going on but thats just too much bad mojo for my family. Not sure where were going next but were leaving here."
"1","If I could gives this place 0 stars I would! Worst experience ever! Horrible customer service and the lady who cut my hair messed up my bangs so bad! I can't believe she has a license to cut hair. Beware of the chola lady with red dike hair!"
"2","Dined here on Friday night. They had a singer and piano player, nice atmosphere. \nThe stuffed mushrooms and antipasto platters were delicious. The cioppino was perfect, nice fresh shellfish and perfectly seasoned marinara. Tiramisu was home made and a great finisher. Large portions and reasonable prices (they throw in the salads with the entrees gratis). Service was attentive but not overbearing. \n\nWe'll be back...."
"1","We have been going to Salute for over 10 years.  Has been our favorite place to go.  Went there for New Years Eve last night, never again.  Still great food, service questionable depending on the server but the owner/boss whatever she is has to be the most ignorant, uncaring, un-service oriented person I have ever met.  We merely questioned the menu re the lack of potato with a steak, the lack of Caesar salad at an Italian restaurant and she more or less told us too bad, the chef is working hard.  She told us that is the way it is, no apology.  We wanted to use a gift certificate from Restaurant.Com, wouldn't accept it.  Finally agreed to take a plain gift certificate.  We told her that we were not happy and would not be back.  She blatantly said, \""I don't care\"" .  They will be out of business within 2 years.  Too bad, great place.  We talked to both staff members and other patrons on the way out and they totally agreed."
"2","A few weeks ago I came here to have an alignment, because someone hit a curb in my car and my tire was wobbling pretty bad.  they did the alignment but that didn't fix the problem.  Well as it turned out I needed a new wheel because the old one was bent.  I drive a mini cooper, and they didn't have the wheel for it so they told me to go ahead and buy it (I bought it online) and they would install it for me.  What I didn't realize until I took it there for the installation was that they were going to do it free of charge.  I think these guys are great.  I will continue to go to them in the future!"
"1","This is the worst experience I have ever had in the Auto service industry. I made an appointment for an oil change with a Groupon coupon I had purchased. My appointment was at 9am and I arrived on time. I asked how long it might be and was told an hour. I sat down in the waiting room with three other individuals who had arrived prior to me. The one gentleman was in for a tune up, one gal to have her breaks checked and another woman to get her brake pads replaced. Two hours and fifteen minutes later the four of us are still sitting there with no news or updates on our vehicles. The breaks checked gal decides she will need to come again another day and when she tells the clerk this he says, \""Are you sure? We are about to pull your car in now.\"" The break pads woman left after 3.5 hours. At 11:15 am the clerk comes to tell me that they did not have the correct oil filter for my car so they have ordered one but he doesn't feel comfortable letting me leave with the current one installed and asks if I can wait another 15 minutes. I reply by stating that I don't feel that I have a choice. At 12:54 he comes to tell me my car is ready. (What happened to 15 minutes?) He offers me six free oil change coupons for the inconvenience and states that \""it doesn't normally take this long.\"" Yet everyone else in the waiting room had been waiting nearly as long for their minor services as well. Four hours for an oil change? No offer to take me home, no communication as to what was taking so long, no honest apologies - just an offer to come back for free oil changes. Free or not, my time is worth more than that. I was not pleased when I left to get into my car to find my keys were dirty with a black residue and so was my steering wheel, emergency break and shifter. Yuck! I had to clean me and the inside of my car after my visit. I was sorely disappointed."
"2","Great restaurant for family, friends or even date night! Each time I go, I'm treated like family.  Excellent service and excellent food at a great price.  My favorite is the Mama's Spinatos Signature Fresh Calzone with Ricotta.  It is out of this world good!"
"2","This is our favorite pizza place...we probably go once a week and enjoy ourselves every single time. The pizza is AMAZING!! We always get the same thing,  a large (cause we always want to take some home!) thin crust pizza with green olives, feta and salami... and it is literally the best pizza we've ever had! Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good. Very family friendly (sometimes too many families...) but the patio is always a good, chill option. Def dont pass up an opportunity to experience Spinatos!"
"2","Yum. Signature Mama all the way. This is a great place, no matter how you slice it."
"1","Great food, bad management and service. Get take out!"
"2","I absolutely love this place. I just moved back to Arizona from New Mexico and was really excited to find a local pizza place. There is a perfect amount of garlic in their pizzas. Its just fantastic. I've never gotten a bad pizza ever.."
"2","Just love this place. My family is hooked ;) Someone FINALLY brought Chicago to Arizona. Dream come true. Fabulous food!"
"2","The pizza here, phenomenal! They have a sweeter marinara sauce, it's to die for. Their appetizer 3 meatballs in vodka cream sauce, ahh melt in your mouth amazing. I tried the spaghetti calzone in vodka cream sauce this last time, and it was great! Service is always good. If it's busy, which it always is, food can take a little while to come out, but it's worth it!! Oh and you get a free canoli on your birthday :)"
"2","These guys are great. I get all of my vehicles aligned here and its always done quickly and properly."
"2","When I have to go to Starbucks (and because of my girlfriend's Caramel Machiatto with too many shot addiction i often do) this is the one that pisses me off the least. I have had a string of bad luck with service and drinks at other locations but the people working at this location really have their shit together. \n\nThe espresso is hardly ever even burned! Almost everyone who works here is sweet as daisies and they even occassionally let me out with my black coffee for free. \n\nThe location is generally quiet and well behaved as far as patrons go so I don't even mind hanging out for a bit to work on my crosswords.\n\nThis location does a great job of reminding me that Starbucks was once a neighborhood coffee house with good business values."
"2","Don't judge a book by it's cover! I recently started coming here and from the outside it looks small and corner-ish; almost like a diver bar. However as soon as you walk in the door you feel as if you have walked into a Costo. I could almost play basketball in the store. The spaciousness is really important to me and you can pick a good seat and survey the entire store. The wall strip of never ending outlets to plug in whatever electronic device is more than useful. The staff are all really affable and cater to your specific needs. Def a great local to read, study, or just get some work done!"
"1","TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.. long review but worth the read. Don't make the same mistake I did. \n\nI actually signed up for Yelp to write this review because my experience was so off putting. AVOID MIKE MARTIN. He was a very nice guy to start, I explained my situation; First time buying a car, my price range, I was already financed, knew the exact car I wanted. He suggested we take a ride, however, before we got the keys I mentioned it seemed a little out of my budget, but he insisted we drive (good sales tactic) Long story short after we got inside he became the aggressive car salesman we all stereotype. He raised his voice   ripped off his glasses, threw both elbows on the desk and told me \""I clearly have never bought a car before\"" (which was one of the first things I told him) After that I mentioned how I still think the car is out of my price range and he told me that I would have to get financing through the dealership and called it a \""stupid idea\"" to get financing any other place. What shocked me the most was when I told him I didn't want to low ball nor do a back and forth sales negotiation. If the price works we have a deal, if not lets not waste time. His response was \""It's because of people like you we have to do this\"" After a comment like that I walked out. Tried to resolve with the manager a few days later (he tried to sell me another car...what?) and I was assured it would be brought to Mike's attention. All in all its a nice dealership, decent selection but horrible buying experience. If you are looking for a great no B.S. car buying process I recommend taking your money elsewhere."
"2","Great dealership and one of the easiest car purchasing experiences I've had. Nathan was great and seemed as though he was an old pro despite learning he had only been working there a short time. Fair prices, low pressure, will definitely return"
"1","Ok, if you like canned chicken, no spices and little flavor, this is your place!\n\nThe chicken Tortilla soup was good, and the chips... The salsa and everything else was processed, canned, pre-made garbage!  Fuck this place and it's food!\n\nMiguel was very nice and the bathrooms are clean, but beyond saying hi to a nice waiter or pissing on clean porcelain, don't bother!"
"2","Delicious. This was our first visit since Thai Rama has been closed and we were not disappointed.The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Tom Kah soup was some of the best I've ever had and the lemon infused water was a nice touch. We also had the sweet and sour chicken which was kinda meh but everything else was quite tasty. We will be back for sure."
"1","Wanted to get a sectional reupholstered and ended up with a nightmare of an experience."
"1","Worst Customer Service and follow-up appointment.  I traveled from North side of town to view Design Center.  Location was not the best but I thought it would be good once inside.  Man was sitting at desk and never bothered to greet.  Sales Person came over and I made appointment for one of Team Members to come to residence and get ideas and work quoted.  It NEVER HAPPENED.  So Disappointed that they did not even call me back to say they were too busy.  Glad this happened as I cant imagine if they actually got awarded for contract work; their follow-up would be horrible.  BUYER BEWARE!  Customer Service and Follow-up is what gets your business relayed to friends."
"2","I like this place. It's clean and big, and always has a ton of staff. They are incredibly friendly and do fast, great work. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Plus they always accommodate you to make sure you can get in, even as a walk-in customer. They'll even stay late to make sure you get taken care of."
"2","My dog is 86 pounds of pure chicken. She's a rescue who is still very nervous around strangers (and vacuums, doorbells, and wood flooring), and her size can make her a real monster when she's scared. Yet she still needs annual checkups and booster shots, and Lookout Mountain is the lucky winner. The front desk was very cooperative at shuffling her right into the exam room when we arrived so that she wouldn't have to sit in the waiting room (with all those scary strangers). The vet tech and the vet were both very patient and so very sweet to her throughout the visit. My dog responded very well to their kindness, and actually behaved better for them than she has with any other stranger (even though the mailman has never tried to put a thermometer in her butt!). I'm very happy with how they handled my dog. (Though, from experience, it helps to schedule the first appointment of the morning and call them en route to warn them that a big scared dog is on its way.) They also see my cat, which has also always been a positive experience. (But he's always well behaved at the vet. He's just glad he gets let out of the evil plastic box inside the evil metal box on wheels. He doesn't care what the vet does to him, as long as he's out of the box.)"
"1","This place kinda sucked. We went araound lunch time so it was almost at full capacity I fig it would be ok since it was full and all. It looked like there was 2 people working here. I give props to the mex girl cooking all the food. It's cafeteria errrr um Subway style mexican food they ask you what you want and add it to your burro or w/e you get a tray and sit. I had a veggie burrito which was basically rice and your choice of black or pinto beans they did have 3 tortilla's to choose from. It was a pretty big burrito and fairly good but nothing special. The kid had a chicken quesadilla which was tiny they put like maybe a tablespoon of chicken in it with a side of cinnamon chips they gave her like 4 chips and a small ftn drink not very much for the 4.25 kids meal if you ask me. Their Salsa bar was disgusting with wilted cilantro, salsa's, limes and lemon's. The only plus here is the drinks! They serve good beer here Modelo, dos XX, Cuervo rita's, and even 99 cent margaritas everyday which I did not try. They also had fountain jugos. I may go back next time but more for the drinks."
"1","HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Beware when ordering they will not even attempt to correct there mistake! I ordered the shrimp and vegetable dinner combination. To my surprise when my food arrived it was just shrimp and vegetables not the combination. I called the store back, explained the problem, and told them I would pay for a full size fried and egg rolls ( to match my huge potion of shrimp and veggies). The girl on the line said it was no problem that they wouldn't charge me. About 3 min later a women with a heavy accent called and explained that I did not say I wanted a combination and they are too busy to come back. I was so appalled! I barely knew what to say! Too busy to come back and correct there mistake, especially when I offered to pay for it?! I ended up ordering from another place and will never order from this shop again. I would give them 0 stars if I could!"
"2","This is our favorite Chinese restaurant!  Been going there for about 3 years and they did get new owners about a year ago.  We've dined in and taken out food.  It is indeed a hole in the wall but the service is always good and great sized portions - we always have leftovers!  My personal favorites are the crab puffs and the shrimp egg foo young.  My son really likes their eggrolls (I'm just not a fan of eggrolls at all).  The only problem I ever had was on a take out order - they forgot to include my crab puffs!  When I called to complain, they apologized and said they would send them over with their delivery person.  They arrived in about 5 minutes!  So I would definitely recommend Dragon Bowl..."
"2","With as much as I eat here, I'm surprised I haven't given them a review. Whenever I feel like pizza I always order from here. I order online because I have a daughter who likes to yell and scream and it is just so much easier. The order time is always accurate, I LOVE the tracker, and the delivery men are also so nice and polite. I used to go to pizza hut, but after having tons and tons of problems with the pizza-cold, gross, and skimpy toppings; I convinced my husband to let me order dominos and we have never turned back... he just wishes they had a better deep dish crust- which i dont mind either way :)"
"1","Apparantly after 10 years I've been removed from the delivery zone and told that they have never delivered to me because they have no delivery history. Hmmmm.... I've got 10 years of order history from this store but they have never delivered to me. Never, Never, Never go to this store if you can help it. HORRIBLE customer service!!"
"1","I will NEVER go to this salon again to get any service.  I have been a customer of this nail salon for over a year.  Last week I called to schedule an appointment.  After waiting 20 minutes with feet soaking & water now cold-I asked how much longer it would be.  The lady beside me said she would be doing my pedi & it would only be a few more minutes.  I understand a delay, but what's the point of making an appt. if you wait that long?  Once she began my pedicure she seemed to be rushing.  I have 3 places on my feet where she rubbed with the pumice so hard that she burned skin off like an abrasion.  This was on Sat, today is Monday & it still hurts & has not healed.  I will find a new salon.  Wish I knew the ladies name & I would post this!!!  I told her it was hurting so she stopped rubbing so damn hard.  After she painted my toes, she put antiseptic on the worst burn-that only made it burn more!!!  Terrible service...unsatisfied"
"2","We could not be happier with what Desert Gardens did for us. We completely relandscaped front and back and (much to my surprise) added a waterfall that we just love. They were incredibly adaptable and their follow up excellent. Our place looks fabulous!! A great experience!"
"1","what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all.\n\nNext day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. \""Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look.\"" Fine.\n\nCome Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. \""So it leaked since Monday?\"" I asked. \""Monday?\"" \""Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge.\"" He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.\n\nSo here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.\n\nIf you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me, I have a district manager to write."
"1","Terrible service. Stopped here 26 minutes before closing time for a pressure check, said they could not do it... Ugh, terrible tire place. Not recommended. Went next door and they checked and filled all tires, two minutes."
"1","Been here 3x hoping that it may have just been the time of day or server but ALL 3x we went the service was horrible, bathrooms unusable and food just gross.  On our final visit both my wife and I were sick the rest of the night.  Approach with caution... you have been warned!!"
"2","ATD has always gone way beyond what is normally expected to help me with my automotive repairs.  They were able to fixed the AC in my truck and get me back on the road within one day during the middle of the summer when I was traveling from Southern California to Utah and then through Phoenix.  They also do great work on the fabrication and repairs for my sandcar.  They are knowledgeable, helpful and honest.  I highly recommend ATD to anyone for automotive repairs and off-road fabrication. Thanks Craig, Shannon and the rest of the crew at ATD for the great work you do."
"1","I don't expect much from any fast food restaurant.  Truth be told, no honest person does.  It's fast food.  If we wanted a lot, we would just make it ourselves.  What I do expect, and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\n\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30, and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55, and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday, this location is open until 12:00AM, and on the weekends, they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\n\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off, they would be aware because the signs are off, the exterior lights are off, and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\n\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight, but because of the unreliability of this location, I spent my money elsewhere.  \n\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said, the sign-lights were off, the drive thru lights were off, the interior lights were off... on the whole, the place screamed, \""Don't spend your money here!\""), then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\n\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell, but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location, I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \""This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\"""
"2","Me and my wife come to this place all the time. She needs a lot of coffee, that's why. Anyways, we like to come here and get an black tea for me and an Americano for my wife and then head on over to Petsmart to look at puppies and kitties. Next we go over to Ross and try to score some sweet deals so we look like high fashion. That's basically how every weekend goes and it's all started by this very awesome Starbucks. A+"
"2","I'm a total blimpie head so of course I loved this. The blimpie employee here treated me like a regular customer and put extra mayonnaise on my blimpie as long as I wouldn't tell. So happy with my blimpie experience and am ready for whenever i get a blimpie craving again."
"1","The store itself is OK, but the bathroom is DISGUSTING! (See Photos)"
"2","while I didn't purchase anything here the service was super fantastic!   I was looking for a specific item that they did not have, the lady that helped me out spent about 10 minutes looking online to help me find someone locally that might have it.    Thank you and well done folks!"
"1","I like Dr. Desantos. He seems nice and caring. I cannot stand office staff. They seen arrogant and occasionally rude. There is always really long wait time. It is infuriating, considering that they Require you to come in 15min before appointment time. I was refused to be seen ( by office staff, not MD) because I was there 10min prior appointment (not 30 as they required for 1st appt. It was not justified medically, girl on the phone did not verify Why I have made an appointment, could have had an emergency)\nLooking for another obgyn now."
"2","It's a Whole Foods. They are all the same! Which isn't a bad thing for Whole Foods considering the awesome food and product selection!"
"1","I hate this store .. the salad bar is always cold and dry , the Workers are rude and not nice .. over  priced.. Called the corporate office talked with a Debbie , She was as RUDE as the workers , i can see why the workers act like they do ...\n\nSo many other places you can go to get GOOD healthy food for less the price and be treated alot better"
"2","My son's had a great time. The place is not too big where it would be hard to keep track of your kid(s) and it's not too small where you would feel like you are packed in there like sardines. Fortunately, we got there early in the morning when there were not many people there. My boys enjoyed all the playhouses, toys, cars, and train table. I will definitely be taking them back there for more fun times."
"2","New owners within the last few months have brought this place back to a top hot spot for me. The owner is very nice and up forth with his future plans for the establishment. Currently updated is the paint, carpet, small reorganization of the under 1 area, and additional slide to the \""jail\"" area. He has plans to renovate the other half of the building including the cafe. \n\nMy little one loves it here. We enjoyed bringing our lunch in and playing afterwards. The rate has stayed consistant at 9$ and memberships or packages are still avaliable!"
"1","Went based on the great reviews and was a bit disappointed. The play area is small and dirty feeling. This maybe because most things are old including the benches for parent seating and the toys. The cashier was rude also. Was on the phone while taking payment. Won't go again."
"2","Love this place. The new owners have really made it so much nicer. We had my 3 yr olds birthday here and they were so accommodating and the made the entire event wonderful. My 3 and 4 yr old love coming here. The little rooms are adorable and the new jailhouse slide is a huge hit."
"2","Awesome place! Clean, creative, safe, great music and environment for imaginative kids to have a blast. Our little one just turned 6 and we were visiting the area. We weren't sure if this place would be fun for kids older than say 4 or 5. She had sooo much fun! Reminded me of sweet days when I was in kindergarten. This is a great play experience:) So glad we went and at a great price!"
"2","Awesome place kids are tired from all the fun and grandma feel safe watching them have a blast. Second time here shop small local own. Try this place out the instead of a chain the owner is on site. Btw I had a fig and arugula salad pretty good. Also handicap accessible I brought my quadriplegic aunt with  me."
"2","Got my haircut here for the first time here, and it was great. Donald cut my hair and he was great. We got along as if we known each other for years and he cut my hair exactly the style I wanted."
"2","Stopped here to pick up a case for my new iPhone.  An employee immediately came over to help me out.  He showed me a few cases and had samples so he could show me what the felt like and looked like on my phone.  After I picked out a case, I browsed the ear piece section.....picked out a new Jawbone ICON.\n\nI was in/out in 10 minutes.  Great service.....forgot to get his name, but he was very helpful.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
"2","Aqua Touch is one of the few retailers that I frequent to stock and replenish my salt water system. I go here because the store is always impeccable, they have an incredible selection of fish/coral/inverts that are always good looking, healthy and priced reasonably. I come here to stock up on pre-mixed water and frozen fish food. Aqua Touch I am a big fan!"
"1","Sorry guys, but 3.5 hours spent waiting for food that was borderline mediocre simply isn't acceptable. I realize it was Christmas and you were obviously overwhelmed, but our first experience there did not leave a good impression at all. I simply hope we caught you on a bad night."
"1","I have to warn everyone to stay away from doing business with this Regus office! They are owned by a large International firm and will nickel and dime their clients. Just google Regus and you will see what I'm talking about. The employees at the office are very competent and nice but they are not empowered to make any decisions. I just had to deal with a situation that cost me a lot of $. I was a tenant for almost 25 years at this location and I was treated like dirt when I left."
"1","Home of the incredible exploding burrito. This place is awesome if you want to wear your food. Actually, that might be better than eating it. :("
"1","This place was the only thing that was open in the area at 11pm. I was starving and I figured I'd give this place a try. This was a HUGE mistake! I ordered a shrimp and steak quesadilla to go. By the time I got home the quesadilla was not only swimming in fatty oil but it was drowning in it! I was disgusted at the pool of grease that laid atop my food! I tried to save it by blotting it with napkins but it was no use. I was NOT going to put that in my body. It was just not worth it."
"1","The rudeness on behalf of some of the employees at this Walgreens location is profound. One particular visit to this Walgreens I clearly overheard employees laughing at my expense because I couldn't find an allergy medicine. Meanwhile, I was waiting at the counter for service. I now avoid this location on principle. I left fuming, and who wouldn't in my shoes, seeing as all I did is ask a benign question about where a brand of allergy pills is and I don't think that is deserving of a humiliating response."
"2","Five stars for their new happy hour menu, which they call their \""economic stimulus package.\"" \n\n4:00-6:00pm and 9:00pm-close: Domestic drafts are 75 cents. Pitchers? $2.99. Small pitchers are somewhere in between. \n\nI'm really, really easy to please."
"2","ONLY GO IF YOU ARE HUNGRY! We just moved to the area and were intrigued by the sign & the fact the place always seemed packed. Plus we have an affinity for locally owned joints. I ran into to get a couple of cheese steaks one day for lunch...the \""WHOLE\"" cheese steak is like a loaf of bread. Totally worth it, but we ate them for like 3 meals. Very very good. \n\nSo decided to dine in the next time. The large pizza is plenty...really. The wings are above average. We will order them again, but not the best I have ever had. Beer is cold & the soda refills just keep coming. Lots of people having a good time both times we have stopped by so far. \n\nStaff was very friendly & very efficient. They move you in & out quickly.  It is a bit pricery than I expected, but good food & great service.  We will be back."
"1","I think it is a bit pricey for a super casual family restaurant.  The kids meals are like $6 each!  Also, as a vegetarian that doesn't care much for pizza the choice was EXTREMELY limited.  I had a dinner salad and a cheese hoagie.  Would much rather eat somewhere else."
"1","I have eaten at Uncle Sam's periodically since 1991. Today was my last time. We attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser. I handed the server the card when I ordered. Only after we were done eating she came over with the check and informed us that we couldn't use the card as the single Pepsi didn't count towards the \""food order.\"" I had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the \""owner's orders.\"" I asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amount but being just $2.00 short in the \""food cost.\"" He essentially told me that if that was how I felt he couldn't do anything about it \""owner's orders.\"" If they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as I couldn't read the fine print even with reading glasses, and the server should have informed me of the fact when I ordered not after the meal was consumed. Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business. (The soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them, so the inflexible policy is inane.)\n\nOn another note the sandwiches are quite good although I can easily make a better Philly Cheesesteak at home. The pizza and wings are merely average. If you want far better wings go, to Sardella's."
"1","I have been a regular customer for years, but tonight put me over the edge.  Walked in and got seated, waitress took my drink order while I was waiting for my friend. My friend arrived and placed his drink order, his beer took a while to get to table, we both ordered on separate bills, he ordered a 1/4 sandwich and I ordered a half sandwich, His sandwich came 10 minutes before mine, but they brought him a half instead of a quarter, She apologized and said she would only charge him for the 1/4 sandwich.  My order came the food was good but she never brought my side of hot peppers, I also did not get a refill on my tea.  When it was time to get the bill, she told my friend if he took the other part of his sandwich home with him the manager said he would have to be charged for it.  We were stunned, they would rather throw it away instead of giving it to the customer which you gave the wrong order to in the first place, also on his bill they put the wrong price for his beer, that was corrected.  This is not the first time in the last couple of visits that the service was off, or the wrong orders came.  I will take a long break before I go back into Uncle Sam's again, the same with my friend, we probably average going in there about 5 times a month, not anymore, I guess we should have requested one of the waitresses that we know are good servers there like Tiffany, we probably wouldn't have had a problem, but the wise manager I guess does not want our business anymore so we won't spend our money there for a long while.  Maybe they will get their act straight or either we'll see Jon Taffer in there soon.\n\nP.S. On one other occasion I walked out because after waiting and not getting my drink after 12 minutes I decided to go somewhere else, So it is my fault for giving them another chance too soon."
"1","Not impressed with the service or the pizza.  \n\nI was craving some wings and pizza and we were in the neighborhood. We have been here before because we loveee the wings and I thought we loved the pizza.  So we order a small pizza, wings and an appetizer, which was fried zucchini.  We let our waitress know, Aubrey was her name, that we wanted the appetizer first.\n15 minutes roll around and no appetizer! Plus my husband was out of water and she hadn't come around. Finally a different waitress comes out with our order, minus the appetizer.  I mention to her we haven't received it and our waitress shows up just in time to hear this and basically scolds the other waitress helping out, like it was her fault that we didn't get our appetizer.  So we ask for a refill as she leaves, no problem, or at least we thought, 5 minutes into eating their suicide wings (which are by far the hottest hot wings I have ever tasted) my husband is really in need of that water. Finally I see her come around but with no water, she almost makes it to the table when I see that she realizes the same thing and she does a complete 180, and a few minutes later...daa daa!!! Water!!!  Other than the service completely lacking, and the pizza pretty blah, I enjoyed the wings and zucchini.  Unfortunately it did kinda ruin that satisfaction I was going for since after all I was really craving something more than what I got."
"1","The doctors spend barely any time with you after making you wait forever then rush you out without hearing you out. The staff is incredibly abrasive, and unhelpful."
"2","Used to come to this library often while I was in school.  Haven't come here many times after 2007.  But still come here once or twice just to vote for City of Phoenix elections.  Very good location right by PV Mall and near SR-51 and Loop-101.  I believe the city cut the library hours, so this location doesn't even open on Fridays anymore.  But I would agreed on the good librarians working in the library."
"1","Not really impressed with David's Bridal overall, we mainly only come here because the bridesmaids dresses are so cheap. I guess my expectation of someone owning a bridal shop or hiring people that work there, would actually be happy for the brides-to-be, but most of them seem like they loathe their jobs. Maybe they deal with too many bridezillas, but whatever the reason, when someone comes in and you work in retail and they are polite to you, you should just be polite back. The level of service is not that great. They seem very rushed to get you in and out as quickly as possible while doing the least they can to help you before moving onto the next customer. We called to try to schedule an appointment for bridesmaids dress shopping, but I didn't receive a call back so we just stopped in and ended up buying one of them. Then I got a call about a week ago (after already ordering my dress) to schedule the appointment. And they couldn't understand that I wasn't the bride, but merely shopping for my bridesmaid's dress for my sister's wedding. We were told it would take about 2-3 weeks to get the dress in, and I never got a call about it arriving. I had to call them, plus they even have a note on the receipt that if you don't pick it up within a certain amount of time, they will send it back. Good thing I called, because my dress had been in already and we never received a call. The girl that helped me when I came in was polite, but looked annoyed that she had to get up off her chair to run to the back to get my dress. Good thing it's cheap there, otherwise I'm not really sure how any David's Bridal stays in business"
"2","I will always trust them with any car I drive.  They are trustworthy and honest!   I have been their customer for years, but there is one time that Gab wanted to take a little extra time to ensure he diagnosed the problem correctly and it ended up costing me a lot less money for an extra 30 minutes of time for him to validate the actual issue."
"1","This place is the worst for loans. It took four times for them to get my auto loan correct. Of course its always someone elses fault too, I never really got a straight answer as to why I had to come back 4 times to close the loan... Its enough for me to switch banks & I've banked w/ them for ten years."
"2","I come to this location for shared branching. The service here has always been great and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nI'm also happy they are open on Saturdays!"
"1","My hatred for this walmart burns with the fire of a thousand suns.   The ONLY saving grace of this craphole is that they carry quite a bit more inventory than some of the other walmarts.\n\nThere are always employees everywhere but where you need them.  There's a multitude of them milling about the store, except in the paint section, the camping/ammo section, the cash registers...you get the drift.\n\nAnd, while my expectations aren't terribly high as it's a Walmart, holy white/black/brown/olive trash Batman!  They should just go ahead and put in a meth section and make a few extra bucks.\n\nIt's dirty, it smells, the customer service is nonexistent, and you have to wade through the tweakers, but it's cheap and they have a lot of stuff."
"1","This Walmart is the closest to me, so this is the one I have shopped at for years. They recently remodeled it, so now it carries groceries as well as the normal retail section. \n\nI have to say that this store has the worst customer service I have ever seen. The employees are not interested in helping customers. They seem to only be focused on stocking the shelves and going home to their lives. \n\nWhile the prices are fantastic, it is always difficult to find what you are looking for, because they keep changing where everything is located. \n\nAlso when it finally comes time to check out, you should be prepared to wait for at least 10-15 minutes, even if you only have one item.\n\nOverall, it could be a lot better. However the store is pretty clean and you still go home with what you were expecting."
"1","This Walmart sucks, always filthy and never zoned. Produce has rotten fruits n veggies, grocery had out of date products. Management is full of jerks. How do I know this? Oh because I used to work here. They treat the associates like robots who have no feelings. So glad I went to school and got a real job. And to think I almost became the backstabbing piece of garbage with no life manager. Yes fixing cars is a REAL job compared to this place. Oh and I've been shopping this store since it opened and since I was a child, has been disgusting ever since and always will because the hillbilly white trash neighborhood. Why do I keep shopping here? To remind myself of how better I am, I guess."
"2","Was a little reluctant to try Jiffy Lube as opposed to my auto dealer for a basic oil change. I was afraid of the upselling etc. Since I was  overdue on this and hadn't made an appointment anywhere else I decided the (possible) expense of a burned out engine outweighed the annoyance of a \""shark\"" telling me there were multiple things wrong with my car. It turns out they were straightforward, friendly, efficient and I just needed an oil change. I was in and out and on the road."
"2","Great place with best book prices.  Some of the books are not in the best condition but they are a fraction of the original price, all of them are.  It's amazing.  I'll go in there and spend and hour or two looking through different books.  \n\nThey've got everything I like there, photography, nature and some technology.  I also love stopping in there so I can grab those free bookmarks they have at the register.  Also have a cd, record and vintage book section there that is always fun to look at.  Of all the books I've bought there there were under $20."
"1","This place is a dump .... mold everywhere toilets.sinks.showers in cabinets would not deem reasonable for a prison let alone an apartment complex"
"1","I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund. I have lived in rough places but this was by far worse than living in the projects. Please think twice about renting from this place save yourself some headaches and look elsewhere."
"2","It's hhhuuuuggggeeee (that's what she said).\n\nYep, that is just what I said. This place is ginormous and yet it is always so organized that I can find what I am looking for, grab it, and skedaddle before I find something that I wasn't looking for and purchase it anyway (ugh, dang XX chromosones).\n\nAnyway, aisles are broken down by colors, gender, and themes. You can find anything and everything you could possibly need or didn't even know you needed for a party or event including: invitations, balloons, napkins, table cloths, straws, table ware, party favors (they have a candle aisle ), tiki torches, etc. Of course, Halloween time is ridiculously fun here, but they have these costumes year round which is great for those awesome theme parties you may encounter November - September. Need  a fog machine? They have one. How about a gallon of fake blood or liquid latex because you need to go balls to the wall for Halloween? Boom, done, Party City has it and their prices are pretty competitive!"
"2","Friendly people great prices!"
"2","I don't know what I would do without Sally's! I love the professional hair and nail products they offer to the general public that you can't find at Ulta or similar stores. They carry profesional hair color brands such as: Wella, Ion, Clairol, as well as other hair needs such as extensions, brushes, shampoo, conditioners, and removers. One can also find anything and everything you need to give your self a professional manicure or pedicure. Color brands that they carry include China Glaze and Fingerpaints. You can also find other manicure goodies like buffers, seperaters, clippers (and other tools), and nail art/jewelry. There is also tons of artificial nail systems including acrylics, gels, and wraps. \n\nThis location always seems to have what I'm looking for in-stock, which is nice because the two Sally's store closest to me are really far apart.  I also find that the staff here is more friendly and willing to help you with any questions you might have while also letting you do your own thing. I've noticed that they also have a pretty decent selection of Gelish nail colors, but the price for the size is pretty pricey."
"1","Ordered a pizza and their pizza fries for pick up tonight. Ordered pizza at 7:12pm. Email says it takes about 20 mins. Get there about 7:40ish. The girl says we're just waiting on the fries. Oook. Fast forward 20 mins after seeing people come and go. I ask where our order is at. She says matter of factly: \""I gave your order of fries to the wrong order and he's remaking them now.\"" Not an apology nor did they think to tell me this. Now I'm irritated. Fast forward ANOTHER 15 MINUTES...HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE FRIES?? The manager (believe or not) calls my name finally. I asked why did this take so long, it has been well over an hour after I ordered.  Mumbled something about the fries, again no apology. I asked him has our pizza been sitting there this whole time then, getting cold?? He said \""well it should still be FAIRLY warm but I can make another one for you\"" -_-. After waiting so long I didnt want to wait another hour for warm pizza...and so that my fries would get cold anyway. On top of all that I paid for ranch...of course they didn't give it to us and I had to ask for them. Got home, pizza was stone cold. Never again Sardellas!!"
"2","Stopped by Discount Tire to get a nail taken out of my rear tire and filled. As soon as I walked in a gentlemen came out from behind the counter and welcomed me into the store. He assessed my tire and entered all of my info into the computer and said it would be about 30minutes. He was extremely friendly. I waited outside for about 25min and another gentleman pulled my car up front and said everything had been completed and they checked the pressure on my other tires as well. When I asked how much he smiled and said \""Free, we hope that you come back and buy tires from Discount\"". I absolutely will! I bought my last set from Walmart and they were a nightmare. What an exceptional experience."
"2","I used Creations in Cuisine to cater for my wedding reception and the food was fantastic, it was a few years ago but I can still remember the awesome ravioli dish we had and the chicken dish was very flavorful.  I also love their shrimp cocktail, the cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it.  I also went to a Christmas party that they catered and they had prime rib & some of the best mash potatoes I have ever had.  The owners are also very nice and sat with us and took their time to help us choose our dish items, their location is nice with a great display everything and you can see their whole operation.  They also have all the rental stuff for a complete dining experience.  I always recommend them and rave about how their head Chef was a 5 star from the Boulders Resort!"
"2","We rented my son's 4th grade band trumpet from here and his 5th grade french horn.  I can say I'm now a 2 year loyal customer.  This is a family business and it shows in great service and concern for customers' satisfaction.   It is a friendly, no pressure store.  Jon the owner seems always available to answer questions.  Every repair issue was resolved no fuss fixed that same day in store or they provide us a loaner.  The musical instrument tutors at Harmony House were wonderful with my boy and reasonably priced.   The store encompasses several sections of an older strip mall.  There is a guitar/strings area, piano sales - instrument rental area and one with sectioned booths for individual tutoring.  The antique/collectables area is currently being eliminated to create a larger performance area, so items there are 60% off.  (aug. 2014)"
"1","Avoid Sprint if you can. They have the worst cell reception out of all the major companies.\n\nI am in scottsdale, right next to scottsdale rd and macdonald and cannot use the phone at my house. Even when I am traveling, the phones reception is always poor. I would use anyone but this provider."
"1","I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.\n\nTonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.\n\nSome employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but \""if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait\"" Ummmm ok, rude.\n\nHe told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.\n\nSprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless."
"1","It's a real shame when I go to apply for a job and I get spammed relentlessly with Sprint emails now. After this type of behavior, not interested in employment with this company."
"2","Got the gyro, a little peppery but overall very good. Food came out fast and with the sale on their original gyro the price was more than fair."
"2","Sabas has been around forever,  and the quality has always been consistently good.  Their $5 gyro pita deal is insane for the great gyro you get.  The tzazilki (I know I spelled that wrong) is delicious.  \n\nTry the lamb too, its veey good. The owners and staff are always very nice.  Good local spot."
"1","They once were good...not any more. Charged me $17 to do a full wash and interior dressing. They did a half a$$ed job, never put the interior dressing on, left my antenna on through the wash and lost my cupholder ashtray. They must be too cheap to run the A/C in the waiting room, it was hotter in there than it was outside. Lousy place, poor service. Pass them by."
"1","I try not to go to Best Buy at all cost because I'm accustom to receive poor customer service when I go there.  Every now and then, I find myself going there because there simply isn't any other retailer who sells certain items.\n\nToday, for example, I ordered a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard online to pick-up in store.  The Website said that the item was in-stock at this local Best Buy.  I like using the pick-up in store option whenever possible because I like knowing ahead of time that they have the item and that it's waiting for me.\n\nI made my order first thing in the morning and never received a confirmation email.  Typically, you receive a confirmation email no more than 1 hour after you have placed and paid for your order online.  I decided to go to the store to find out that they had my item in the back but that I couldn't have it yet.  When I explained that I had plans this evening and that I wouldn't be able to pick-up my item later, they simply stated that there was nothing they could do.  I asked them why they couldn't just go in the back of house to grab my item that I had already paid for but they said they just couldn't do that.\n\nThis is frustrating for 2 reasons:  1.)  It shouldn't take that long to purchase something online to pick-up in store and 2.) I don't understand why someone can't simply go in the back to grab the item that I've already purchased.\n\nI think I would have been a little more forgiving if the customer service had been better and felt that the person I was speaking with had an ounce of empathy.  Then again, this is Best Buy.  What did I expect?"
"1","Perhaps certain places don't deserve the lowest rating because the person doing the reviewing is not a good fit for that particular kind of place, and so, cannot review it accurately. Because of this, I gave this place an extra star just in case I am biased against these types of places.\n\nNow I will paint humanity with a wide brush and put us all into two camps: \n\n1) Those who would rather play with a dog outside on the lawn on a nice warm afternoon.\n\n2) Those of us who would rather slip outside the backdoor of a rock club in Berlin to snort a quick line.\n\nLet me just say that in my camp we have no use for, nor desire to ever return to, this Outback Steakhouse type of establishment.\n\nWhat I truly think about this place is not suitable for public utterance, but I will go so far as to say the food was dull, the drinks were mixed as if they were for a teething child and not a grown man, and the atmosphere looked as if the decorator was commissioned from the school of bathroom design.\n\nIf you died and went to this place, you would not be in hell, but you would not be very happy."
"2","Came in last night for FREE Blooming Onions. We went straight to the bar area and ordered our onion, mushrooms and two side salads. \n\nFirst off the Blooming Onion is always looks fantastic but that sauce is horrible. I get that some people like horseradish but to me it's a taste that I can never get out of my mouth. I don't know who you folks are that like horseradish, but I just can't trust you. \n\nThe mushrooms were awesome as always! We even took half of the order home and warmed them up in the oven for a snack.\n\nHowever, the salads were kind of pathetic and not worth $3.99 each. I loved the croutons though. But, the salad was very small with cheap iceburg lettuce. \n\nService was top notch. We never went without a refill and he checked back after everything he brought us."
"1","Stopped in for lunch, waited over 45 minutes from order time to entree delivery, Manager indicated he thought performance was unacceptable and offered a step ped up beverage ( what can you do to iced tea?) or a free dessert, We declined dessert at lunchtime and really just wanted to receive our order in a reasonable amount of time. Manager's apology and offer felt scripted, except he said \"" no worries\"" about 10 times. When the entree's arrived my guest's side item was missing.  It couldn't have been much worse and no genuine attempt at service recovery occurred. No rules, just wrong..."
"2","This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \n\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \n\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \n\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.\n\nI was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect. \n\nBetween Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!"
"1","No, we just stopped serving breakfast.\nThe only vegetarian lunch item is the cold veggie sandwich.\nWe're out of wheat bread.\nI *guess* we could toast the bread.\nAll delivered in a forced-friendly-but-really-irritated manner by an extremely bored woman.\nOK, at $18 for lunch for two (1 full sandwich of the day, 1/2 veggie sandwich, two pops) I would hope that you are fully stocked, friendly, accommodating and apologetic, and don't intentionally assault my eardrums with shitty country music while I have to wait forever for very simple food. \nThe food was OK, but our conclusion was that something like Subway would have been faster, better, and less snotty at half the price."
"2","Haven't had a bad meal here yet. The salads are large. Large enough to share or have half and save half for later or lunch the next day. My favorite is the Thai chicken. My husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich. They love the Parmesan pesto spread that have on it. I bring home a tub of the spread (sold sep) and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when I have company. The baked goods are also excellent. All fresh and baked on premises. My favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie. Darn. Shouldn't have told you. Now they will be out when I go!"
"2","Did a lot of shopping around, his prices were the best. Josh does excellent work, though not always in a timely fashion. He seems to have more business than he can handle & could probably use help."
"1","I put in an order in early April, was told by Angela that I would have a proof the next day.  2 days later I called back looking for my proof, was told I'd get a call back the next day, still nothing.  1 week later I called yet again looking for the proof, Angela said I would get a call back that day, nothing.  Finally yesterday I received a proof for the wrong type of sign, I asked them to correct it, they then sent me the correct type of sign, but with the wrong name and wrong phone number.\n\nThey do get 2 stars instead of 1 because I've used them in the past and they do make a quality sign.  I don't mind waiting as long as I'm given an accurate estimate.  Also Josh really is a nice guy, he just needs some additional help."
"2","I have to like this place.. this is where my engagement ring was bought.. well, it was put together.. because the story Im told by my very creative fiance, is that he wanted a particular princess cut diamond with high clarity..+VS or above... and a particular setting with channel diamonds.. My ring was given in the dark of the night.. :-) AND it was huge on my finger.. Jared has an onsite inspector who could tell me if bringing my ring down 2 , almost 3 sizes would mess up the diamonds in the sides.. \nMy one downside.. appraisers are not onsite and only there certain times of the month.. OH make that a two downsides..I was to pick up my engagement ring after the sizing at a particular time.. I called to see if I could get it 40 minutes earlier..Just being impatient and antsy and had to get to Scottsdale.. NO call back.. Even though the receptionist said it should be ready and theyd call back.. Most annoying thing is when someone says they are going to return a call.. and they blow it off.. \nAll and all .. I love Jared:-)"
"1","Wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true?  It is.  \n\nI went in on a Thursday afternoon.  Two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store.  One employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone.  I shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me.  \n\nThe moral of the story: no one will help you if you are standing by the $79 frames."
"2","Went back, still perfect service and staff, still great food, still huge rooms for a fair price.  Love the walking trails.  Going back again!"
"1","So I've come here multiple times. I think the only reason I come here is for the Horchata drink to be honest because it's made by a machine (not them). They take FOOOREEEVVVERRRR to get my food. This is supposed to be fast food. Quick! I'm not in a full service restaurant that I have to wait 20 minutes for my food. The place in the kitchen is a dump. I know since they leave the door open on my way to the restrooms (which you should stay away from). Chemicals next to prep table (near food!!!)  NO BUENO!  Meat was sitting out in the back. I'm not sure how long that was there. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n They have terrible, terrible service. It is always a girl with no uniform wearing regular unprofessional clothing . I'm not judgmental, but she has bracelets and rings on. When you work in food service, you are NOT allowed to have jewelry anywhere near your hands. She could pass on germs and bacteria from the jewelry onto the food. Ok fine. But when someone touches their face and hair and then goes back in the kitchen without washing her hands? I kind of shutter. I've worked in restaurants for so long, that it's just hard for me to NOT notice bad hygienic practices even if to the average person, seems pretty picky. Hey, at least i know the Maricopa County Food Code!\n\nShe always takes my order like, \""Ugh, I can't text and I have to take your order????\"" \n\nI once ordered tacos and it was filled with guacamole. Don't get me wrong I love guacamole, but when I order carne asada tacos, I want to taste the meat, too! So I told the girl, excuse me but...these are waaay overpowered by guacamole. She says \""sorry, I cant make you new ones.\"" WHAT? Seriously? You served me bad food, and I came here for a decent meal. She said, \""do you want me to pick off the avocado? Well, actually, you can do it yourself?\""  Well.Okaaaaay? Thanks....I'll eat disappointed. I don't know why I deal with terrible places that don't care about the customer. I think it's just become it's the norm with fast food. Anyway, it's not really worth coming here."
"1","Driving in the area and hungry, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order:\n\nCarne Asada Burrito, $5.59\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ#MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ\n\nBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $2.98\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg#d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg\n\nThe service here was brutally slow.  The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.\n\nWhile waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw#VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw\n\nThe food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\n\nI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\n\nNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\n\nThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of \""spicier\"" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....\n\nThere are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.\n\nReturn Factor - 0%"
"2","4 legged friends gets 10 stars. Dr. Ferguson and all her fantastic associates are outstanding individuals. I have been going there a very long time and they continue to exceed all my expectations. Thanks for being so caring with all of my 4 legged friends.\n\nPhil and Lynda Saladino"
"1","Bought a mattress and delivery was scheduled a week later. We changed our mind to cancel it next day itself but they won't cancel it even though delivery date is still few days later. Avoid this place, there are so many good places where we can return/cancel if not satisfied."
"2","This isn't a place that you go a whole lot - but BOY are they helpful when you need them!\n\nI brought in my cordless phone that has some special battery internally that was slowly dying to the point that I could only talk on the phone for about 10 minutes per charge.  Not so fun.  I brought the phone here and the guy was super helpful to find the right battery that would work.  While I was there I saw folks getting batteries for SO many amazing and unique things. \n\nSo if you're looking for something a little more complex than a Duracell AA, you should give them a call.  And even if that's all you think you want - if you're in the area you might want to go by because based on what kind of product you're using it for, I heard them suggest different brands/types of AA battery.  Not something I normally want to think about - but handy to know."
"2","I love this place, I come here allot all the food is amazing and well priced. Karaoke every night! and now comedy on Wednesday nights and I believe one other night and it is funny!!!\nService is good, most of the time and the people are all sorts from skaters to bikers to vocalists, if you wanna have a good time and not spend to much this is where you go!!!"
"1","I really don't know what people see in this place. One thing, it does have that old crusty bar feel. We went as a group for drinks and food. The initial drink service was pretty quick and the experience diminished from there. I ordered one of the starred items off the menu, the Reuben. Three words best describe the sandwich ... greasy and tough! Another person at the table ordered chicken fingers, they were so dry she only ate half of one. The last person at our table had a cheese quesadilla, it was cold and looked like it had been microwaved.  The astonishing thing, the waitress actually pocketed my change from my food order.  They do like their regulars though and seem to treat them well. I can't say I would recommend going unless you are dying to find a karaoke bar.  I know I won't be going back any time soon. Actually, the sandwich I ate didn't sit very well with me either."
"2","I Love this place! Its around the corner from my house and reminds me of the dive bars in San Diego. \nTheir happy hour is really cheap and they do karaoke every night, which my roommate loves. I could pass on that part.\nthey also do trivia night and play every major league game usually. \ndefinitely a spot to check out if you're in the area. Good for after dinner drinks, or as a meeting spot after work.\nThe people that come here are all very social and everyone seems down to earth. \nTheir sliders are good but a little on the greasy side (buns covered in oil), but their tacos are to die for.\nThey have two pool tables and video game machines, so you don't have to just sit around and drink, except that's what I like to do. Hahhaa will definitely be back."
"1","This place was HORRIBLE! It's extremely small I am almost sure it was a Mc Donald's \nBefore it was a Denny's. On a busy Sunday there is no place to wait in comfort. The AC sucks & they don't accommodate seating for large families. We waited more them 25min for them to say it will take longer to seat us cause it would be a fire hazard. Sad thing is NONE of us are over weight. They could not accommodate a seating for the baby in a high chair."
"2","One of the best pedicures I have ever had! My nails are beautiful, really appreciated that Don made a suggestion and showed me what it would look like before putting on my nails. Only slight irritation was that I made appointment but I still waited 30 minutes. Because everything was great, I am able to over look that."
"2","Pretty nice despite the location. Very quick to get me in a seat and get started. Not to welcoming though. Presented a nail design and they did everything they could to match it for me. Also did a good job trying to match my gel polish color to my regular polish color for my toes. Did a great job with the gel, very thick and covered entire nail. Lasted a long time, about 2 1/2 weeks maybe. The pedicure was one of the best I've ever had! The had many options for the pedicure. You could pick what you wanted at decent prices. I get pedicures for the massaging. Longest massage I have ever gotten without paying extra. With both the sea salt and lotion. It was amazing and just the right amount of pressure. Did a nice job painting my toes as well. They were a little mad I didn't have cash for a tip though, I never carry cash. I will defiantly be coming back here!"
"2","I LOVE Theresa. She's the best! She is always happy to meet any request I have for my nails. I like designs on all of them usually and she is always spot on in doing the design I want. Not to mention the quality of the actual acrylic nail is awesome, my nails never lift, chip or break, and I wear them fairly long. All of her nail art is pretty and she is never rude or rushed when doing my nails ( I have gotten that reaction many times at other salons when requesting nail art ) another thing I have gotten a lot of at other salons when I ask for certain things is \""oh no I can't do that because...\"" Theresa always does my nails however I want. I won't go to anyone else. Her pedicures are amazing too. Love this place."
"2","Delicious, delicious, delicious...from the wine, to the bread and garlic butter...the entrees and on to the desserts! Nice atmosphere and great service as well. This is a must go to restaurant!"
"1","We have eaten here many times over the years both at the original 40th St and Bell location and this newer location at 40th and Thunderbird location.  Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious, plus the service was always attentive.  My only issue with it was I considered to be a rather pricy restaurant.\n\nThe last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing.  I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what, but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy.  The prices are still as high as before.  The service we had the other night was abominable.   The server, Jenn, was one of the worst servers we have experienced in a long time.  There were two occupied tables when we arrived (and two other servers) and we had to wait for over ten minutes to be acknowledged and for our drink order to be taken.  The specials she told us were not the same as another server was telling his table.  The meal went downhill after that.  We had to ask and re-ask for just about everything.  The one bright spot was the bus girl who was so attentive.  Jenn kept telling us how busy she was (at her busiest she had three tables) yet she had plenty of time to talk at length to a table about what was happening on the TV show \""Big Brother\"".  It even took forever to get the check, which was finally handled by another server.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing, expensive meal that was ruined even further by a terrible server."
"2","My friends are regulars at Roma Garden and I've joined them there several times now. The service is good, the food is great. Huge portions and they'll custom order for you when they have the ingredients on hand. They don't rush you through your meal and have a nice balance of attentive but not intrusive service. The free Amaretto at the end of the meal is an added bonus."
"1","I've finally been there enough times to realize that I don't like it. \n\nThe beans are bland and the rice is salty. The salsa isn't right, either. They have all of the typical tacos, enchiladas, and other stuff you'll find in a similar Mexican place, it's just not as good.\n\nThe service is sub-par. I've noticed that the bussers do their thing right; refilling water, cleaning up, etc. The servers are happy to take their time with everything and leave you hanging.\n\nThe last few times I went to this place, it was the decision of someone else. I'm not going back."
"1","After years of enjoying this place, from Camelback road to here, I will never go back.  The waiter took 10 minutes to return our Visa, the place was empty, so we asked the mgr what was the holdup. He lost his temper so badly! \""Are you accusing my staff of stealing?\"" he asked us. We expected him to say, \""hold on and I'll go check on it\"" not to go off on us for a reasonable question.  Our jaws dropped.  He was so nasty and borderline unstable. He invited us to never come back, thought we were on Punked.  God forbid someone actually complain, he might throw them out. Still waited longer for the credit card after that.  We were too stunned to ask to see another mgr, just left in shock.  Bad attitude and average food, skip it. Too many nice business owners to give hard earned money."
"1","i really hate to do this, but i have to. service was slower than slow. my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese. turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been. the staff seemed gloomy and sad. it just wasn't a good experience. it really is too bad, i haven't had lunch at a einstein's in forever and i was hoping it would be as good as i remember it."
"1","This is consistently the most unorganized Einsteins we go to. We try to avoid this location but when we find ourselves here our hopes are that they've improved. Year after year we've found they they stay consistent: unorganized and confused."
"2","I have been coming here on and off for a few years.  I will only have May do my eyebrows - she's great!  They always look good even when I go too long without a wax!  I recently let her do my nails.  I never have them done because I leave them very short for typing.  But she did a great job and I think I will keep them!"
"2","I agree with a prevous poster who says this Rubios is the best in the area. The employees are super friendly and nice. Between my kids and myself, we usually make tons of modifications:( hold this, add that etc.)...I always order the chipotle ranch chicken salad (minus chicken and cheese w/ dressing on the side)..they always take my order without batting an eyelash and ALWAYS get it right..my salad is always crisp and fresh and we probably take out from Rubios 3 times a month..."
"2","The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced . My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone yesterday and I rushed her there hysterical of course. They gave her immediate attention and saved her life . That let me sit with her as she woke up from sedation and also stayed with us as she came to. Dr.Isom was right by our side and couldn't have been more comforting through my hysterical crying. After all was said and done I returned home so grateful with my girl Jazzy. Thank you Indian Bend"
"1","If I could give this location a zero star rating, I would. \nI took what use to be my beautiful miniature 5lb maltipoo to be groomed at Petco. Worst experience EVER! Left her there at 11:30 in the morning and at 3:45 she was still wet!  Chris, the \""so called-groomer\"" was trimming her... I questioned why he was doing it basically wet and he looked annoyed by me.... that's when I walked out into the store, as she was clearly not ready to be picked up, and could hear her screaming... I evened asked the retail clerk if this guy ever worked with small dogs.... 30 minutes later... she came out completely chopped up! Nothing about her cut was even and she was completely shaking. Bows would not stay on because her cut was so choppy and you could tell that she was never blown out! The guy must have seen my face as he said he wouldn't charge me. .. but he did say it was \""her fault\"" because she moved a bit!! I am so ticked off as the only thing the manager said to me was that I was the only one who's ever complained about him! ...SERIOUSLY?!?! NEVER TAKE YOUR DOG TO GET GROOMED AT PETCO (unless you like the scruffy mutt look)... I am so regretting this choice. The worst part about the whole thing... nobody there ever offered an apology... just a whole bunch of excuses. =("
"2","I love this place! The ambiance of blaring music and Mexican soap operas on tv is awesome. The food was shockingly fresh for being in the middle of Arizona.  Couldn't be more authentic even if you were in Mazatlan. I had seafood served in a hollowed out young coconut. Not only delicious but the presentation was beautiful. It could have come out of one of Jean-George's kitchens in NYC. No Joke. That was the last thing I was expecting when I pulled up to this kinda run down little strip mall. Go. Enjoy."
"2","We go to Arties all the time and have never had any issues and love it more now that they have a post office in the back, so we don't have to drive to the post office. It is a little cramped, but the staff has always been great in helping me find things. I also love the fact that I can take my dog. She loves to go in there but I won't take her during very busy times."
"1","Awful customer service from everybody there (including the post office people). Very rude, inconsiderate, and unhelpful.\n\nThe prices are not good.\n\nIt is a pain to return anything here.\n\nWe live just a few blocks away, so it is unfortunate that we can no longer go to this store. However, after numerous visits (we kept trying to give them more 'second' chances), we have come to the conclusion that it is just better to go to Home Depot a couple miles away.\n\nOur advice is to go to Home Depot just two miles up the road at Tatum and Bell. The prices are better, the customer service is friendly, and the return policy is great!"
"1","Went to this bar last night since it was close to my apt. and rec'd decent reviews from Yelpers.......NOT!! I have never been so obviously ignored since my days in Southie (a well known anti-black area of Boston). I paid for my drink and the bartender placed my change in front of the guy sitting next to me. Ok, simple mistake, I thought. Watched the game and once my drink was done I saw her talk to her cadre of friends for over 20 minutes before I got another one...and it was the guy sitting next to me who bought me one and apologized for the now noticeble slight. When my drink arrived, I questioned the delay (4 people at the bar and maybe 9 in the whole place), the bartender asked me to leave. I walked and will NEVER return. Don't know why this place is rated so high. It sucks..."
"2","Usually come here when I feel like getting away from my immediate hood. Laid back crowd and atmosphere, awesome outdoor patio and the drinks are reasonably priced. My girl Laura always takes care of me. Always a fun place to go (literally) tucked away from the P.V. Mall area."
"1","I got a coupon in the mail for this place which offered several deals. I chose to call and make an apt (preferred by them) for Sunday. That was easy. I arrived 15 min early was greeted and seated on time. Those are the reasons I gave 2 stars. \n\nI failed to give 3 more stars because all the nail polish was overused, but more importantly, I did not feel the cleanliness like i do at other nail salons. I watched after the tech used the tools on me, she went to a sink behind a wall and did who knows what. I assume she washed with water and soap if we're lucky!! She then went on the do the next pedicure. I did not witness any chemical cleaning of pedicure bowls in between people either. \n\nJust doesn't excite me to return!"
"2","This is your basic Ulta- not the big one with every bell and whistle.  BUT-- they are in the neighborhood and there's a lot to be said for convenience.\n\nThe employees are friendly, and generally leave you alone.  If you need help, however, they are genuinely helpful.  \n\nIt's clean and well organized.  If I need a last minute \""emergency\"" gift (translate: teenage girl birthday)... I can count on getting something that will be a hit.  \n\nPlus:  LOTS of sample size / mini items, great nail care selection, almost always have my salon haircare products."
"2","Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was very happily surprised at my dining experience.\n\nThe hostess was friendly, waiter funny and attentive, and other staff said goodbye to us as we left.\n\nHad to have edamame to start of course, and for the first time ever at a Japanese restaurant, they were steaming hot and not over salted.\n\nI had the salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll. Tasty and fresh.  ---sorry but I'm not a fan of shashimi, so I stick to rolls.\n\nHad another dish called \""Dragon Tails\"" which was chicken stir fried in  a spicy, almost buffalo style hot sauce. Huge portion.\n\nWhen I peaked at the other diners across the room every portion looked really big! I mean at least two if not three portions per serving.\n\nOur entree was out a few minutes earlier than the sushi, the waiter came by a few times and kept us updated, but it seemed as if he knew the sushi would come out later so why not wait 5 min then turn out order in to the kitchen?\n\nNice yummy, hassle free lunch.  Thank you Shogun."
"1","How is this place in business?  Seriously!\n\nI'm still angry over how bad this place was.  My brother who was with me agrees.  So here is what happened...\n\nWe sit down, look over the menu and instantly notice that the place is super expensive, even for lunch.  Then my brother points out that everyone sitting down seems to be over the age of 50 and eating huge piles of colored salads.  I'm guessing this is the turkey salad.  \n\nMy theory is that for the price everyone went for quantity.  We skipped the original plan for sushi and rolls because at $12 - $15 at lunch this place did not have the atmosphere or the token chefs to warrant those prices.  We decided to start easy and try the Panko Udon noodle soup with tempura.  \n\nMy false expectation:  Thick udon noodles, in a nice translucent dark broth, with tiny green onion bits floating on top, paired with a plate of assorted vegetables covered in a light fluffy batter.  Add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place.  All this would then combine in my mouth into that great saliva generating Udon freshness that I have come to love.  \n\nIt arrived...\n\n-INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE-\n\nThe not even joking reality:  Placed in front of me was a white bowl of soy sauce with a pile of store bought rough spaghetti noodles.  Floating in this disappointment was a horror show of deep fried unrecognizable straight from the freezer bag vegetable shapes.  I say shapes because vegetables  usually have flavor which is the whole reason for including them in a dish, these could have been cardboard cutouts soaked in grease.  I wish I was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles.  It tasted like something a Home Ec student from Beverly Hills would have made first day of class.\n\n-INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE AGAIN-\n\nWell we didn't find the hidden camera and only got a few bites into the mess before giving up.  Here is the best part, the bus boy was not at all surprised when he picked up the plates mostly unfinished.  Weird wait staff aside, Shogun is absolutely hands down the worst Sushi place I have ever eaten at.  If you can't do Udon Soup don't put it on the menu.  They should be ashamed for taking that much money from innocent people who don't know what good sushi tastes like.\n\nAvoid the disappointment and save yourself some money.  You're better off at East Wind 1 mile north at Thunderbird and Tatum.  Better yet head to over to Hiro Sushi at Shea and the 101, its absolutely worth the drive.\n\n-INSERT FINAL EXPLETIVE HERE-"
"2","Not sure where all of the other reviewers on this site go for sushi, but I found Shogun to be right in the middle of the road for pricing.  Cheaper than Sapporo, Ra & Ah-So but a little more expensive than your traditional mom & pop sushi.  I say if you want to be seen in your micro mini with your gel head boyfriend than head to one of the aforementioned places.  If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun.  I have been going here for nearly 20 years, well before they bought out the other side and built the bar area.  The sushi bar is always the way to go as you can be in and out in 20 minutes.  They have a fun little patio for groups (when it's not 115 outside).  I'd much rather support this establishment that has been locally owned forever than head out to another cookie cutter sushi chain."
"1","Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards. \n\nI was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.\n\nI would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.\n\nCheers,\nUntil then, get the beers in...\nJust not at Shogun."
"2","My girlfriend and I have been Shogun fans for a few years and when we can, we'll take in a few of the monster-sized rolls, some edamame and Saki and call it a night.\n\nToday I went for the lunch special and was very pleased with the portions and the price.  The Katsu chicken was crisp and not over cooked and the roll was right on target. \n\nWe usually feel like we've been well fed, well served and reasonably priced.  The fish is alway fresh, the sushi chefs always accommodating to create a special version of a standard roll and the wait staff kept our glasses filled.\n\nI read some of the other reviews and feel that over the long run, some are off base - this is my perspective from over more than a few years of being a semi-regular dinner."
"1","The food was just okay. Super greasy from the lard in the beans and meat was not of good quality. The tortillas they used were very good though. But because if the grease pouring out of my burrito I couldn't eat it."
"1","RIGHTS VIOLATION ALERT!\n\nMy wife had an appointment for a blood pregnancy test. We walk in for the appointment, and they refuse to do the test. Then they wouldn't allow me back there with her for her appointment. They  also forced her to recount events that happened several years ago, which threw her into a full-blown panic attack/PTSD attack. They still wouldn't allow me back there with her. So if you care about your loved ones at all, don't bother with this place."
"1","Very poor customer service. Hostess was rude and ignored us when we arrived. When seated finally she had a bad attitude. Also, our server never showed up and we ended up leaving."
"1","We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.  The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor.\n\nIf a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will."
"2","I love Dillards, this location at PV Mall is smaller than the one I usually go to, but it does a decent job still putting out labels in their tiny Contemporary section , just in limited styles and quantities. The shoe department here, as previous reviewers have mentioned, is pretty awesome. This Dillards has a MAC makeup counter which is rad and today I noticed they have a  \""The Edge\"" beauty section. I was immediately attracted to the Too Faced brand displayed on the wall and noticed they also have Studio Gear, Murad, and some Philosophy products as well. This new addition is a big plus as I am always going between Ulta (which is across the street) and here for MAC products. Now I have the brands that I love all in one department store! Go Dillards! The children's and men's departments are rather large and of course they have a junior's and women's section."
"2","This is the only Chinese place I order from. They are very good with delivery, always on time, and always have the exact thing I order. This place should have more stars, they don't have five star food by any means, but you get the good value you pay for. Best Chinese delivery in the area. Ordered from \""Yang House\"" twice, and was very disappointed they never delivered what I ordered, so I looked else where and found this nice little gem.\n\nBY THE WAY, this place is real NY style Chinese; if you order chow mein (like our friend Nicole H. here) you will get no noodles. If noodles are included in the dish you want, read the menu, and order lo mein."
"1","Machines are very old - many out-of-order. Premises not very clean.  A tacky place.  Will not go there again."
"1","Went there for 2 problem the main problem was fixed but costly. Second problem said a/c composer need to be replaced 1200 dollars so had second opinion was actually the fan 165 dollars.   Nice that they checked for the real problem never going back there."
"2","Very nice chill bar in ne phx, bartenders here know how to pour a drink & are very easy on the eyes. Great place to hang for a few after work. A+++"
"1","This is the second time I've ordered from them. First time the pizza was awesome!!  This time it was very soggy!  Wigs on the other hand where delicious. I also go a slice of cheesecake to go. I paid $.85 for cherries. When I went to dive into my cheesecake the \""cherries\"" that they gave me turned out to me ketchup. Gross. I called to tell them and their response was, oh let us give you $.85 to reimburse you for the cherries. What?!!  Ha ha. Probably won't go back."
"1","Totally messed up my order did not care it was crazy how much they did not care was kind of like hey you drove here so might as well take what we got"
"2","Responded promptly when emailed to set up appointment. Salesman was very helpful and installer professional. Got the screens up quickly and neatly. Pleased with their services."
"1","BARF BARF BARF\n\nQuite possibly the grossest food I have ever eaten.  The chicken lo mien was made with spam-ish meat product-- Does that make is Spamish meat product lo mien? I ended up eating just white rice and soy sauce with egg rolls--- can't mess up fried egg rolls right?  I did have to salt them though, they were pretty taste-less. \n\nThe ambiance is less than desirable as well, our plates never got cleared and the amount of unshowered people sitting near me made me want to go home and take a hot bath with all the soap in the world.  \n\nI will not return to Lim's and I suggest you not go either."
"1","Lim's Chinese Boofay is a throwback china boofay.  If you want seafood and spring rolls and vegetables and no MSG, you'd better head elsewhere.  If you remember going to a china boofay in 1979, back when nobody knew or cared that Chinese people never eat this stuff, and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food, then Lim's is your place.  I'll bet that the recipes and decor are the same as they've been for the last 30 years.\n\nYou've got your requisite fried rice, lo mein, beef/broccoli, sesame chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, eggrolls, fried chicken, and maybe a couple of other items beyond that.  Everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum, but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing feel when I left.  Not a taste, a FEELING, left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine.  Blech.\n\nThe Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken, but instead of honey it was flavored with syrup--cheapass imitaion ''maple'' corn syrup.  Still, I must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken, and was my favorite if I had to pick a poison.\nS&S pork looked lean, with large chunks of nonfatty meat, but the insides were a little gristly, and each bite in had about 20% come back out onto the Discard Pile.  Seems like they tried to keep it lean, though.\n\nIn the entire boofay table, there was hardly any color from veggies.  All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section, plus brocolli in the beef&broc, carrots and onions in the S&S, and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.  That's about it.  Oh, the egg rolls had cabbage inside, too, and Are the old school thick skinned, bubbly deep fried and mushy, not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind.\n\nLim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile, so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg, using honey instead of syrup on the chicken, and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix.\n\n$6.25 lunch ($1.50 more for a soda) was not worth it, no matter how much volume you shove in.\n\nStill buzzing from the weird msg high.  No sir, I don't like it."
"1","We were looking for a different chinese place but when we got there it wasn't open yet so we gave this one a try.\n\nThis is an older place, kind of a hole but I noticed that the staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. The waitstaff was friendly.  The food was ok, it wasn't exactly good but most of it was edible.  $7.25 for the buffet on the weekend but I think it's cheaper during the week, $6.25 or something like that was on the sign.\n\n2 drinks, 2 buffets came to $19 and some change.  \n\nI wouldn't really recommend this place, they didn't do anything \""wrong\"" but they don't do anything right either."
"1","One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere."
"1","The food was passable. The dining room was nearly empty at 7 pm on a weeknight. Not that I crave a crowded and noisy dining experience, but it would've been nice to think we'd made the right choice eating there by seeing other diners voting with their wallets.\n\nI don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.\n\nThe food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out)."
"1","Went there after hearing about the Arizona Cardinals promotion, if the Cards won, you get a free medium coffee the day after the game.  Well, I went, didn't know about the app for the smart phone.  Was told that I need the app and the phone wasn't with me.   Didn't get the coffee, walked away unhappy."
"1","Before I talk about the food I must say that this place is crazy expensive.  We tried this place because it was close and got tired of driving down to 7th Street for Pei Wei or Flamingo Palace. The pork fried rice was decent,  the house chicken was not at all good and the chicken lo mein was simply terrible  And for this less-than-mediocre food you pay more than Pei Wei and approaching P.F. Changs.  Next time I want typical chinese fair, I'll drive the extra few miles to Flamingo."
"2","So far I have had only good experiences with this practice and the doctors. The office is brand new and very clean, modern, and big. The staff including the doctors has always been very accomadating and friendly. One thing I really like about this office is the built in lab, anyone who knows what it is like to to have to drive to a lab for your doctor knows what I mean. Although I hate going to the doctor I have been very happy with this office, and I would reccomend it to anyone."
"1","I had been to 40th St. Cafe a few times previous to my last visit and thought quite highly of the place, however, my last (and final) visit was a total nightmare...I got food poisoning for the first time of my life and have finally been able to keep solids/liquids down.  I would not wish food poisoning on my worst enemy. \n\nFWIW, I had the ultimate skillet for breakfast (I know - it sounds gross just saying it), so I'd surely recommend to tready lightly with the meat if you visit this spot.  \n\nAdditionally, the service was lousy and there were a lot of weird vibes/negative energy around the place.\n\nI opted not to report this to the health department and decided to post to Yelp instead."
"2","This isn't a bad place to go and get a beer and some grub.\nAlthough I'm not really sure why it's categorized under pizza\n(Since pizza isn't even on the menu)\nThe menu consists mainly of burgers wings and sandwiches \nThe prices are reasonable \nStaff seems friendly \nThe decor looks like every guys idea of a bar in his garage \nI'll definitely be back again"
"2","What great customer service!  I needed to purchase straw for a pumpkin patch we were putting together for an event and I called back several times with questions and changes.  Each time, the lady on the phone (wish I had her name) was so patient and I truly appreciated that.  Their driver Chris was amazing and so kind!  I would recommend Western Ranchman to anyone!  Thank you for delivering excellent customer service!"
"1","OMG~ generally I like Massage Envys.  It's a hit or miss whether you get a good or bad therapist and you have to learn to ask for specific ones~ the good thing is you can almost get an appointment last minute.\nBUT at this particular location, the staff seems to have forgotten they are a massage place and not a used car lot!!!!\nI came out of the massage not entirely happy since the guy that massaged me was a bit I don't want to use the word weird, okay, weird, okay, to be kind~ not to my liking.\nBut I decided I would still be pleasant and pay for the massage . . . at the counter, the girl checking me out just would not let me go without arm twisting me to sign up for membership!!!!\nShe told me they were offering a membership special that was for THAT day and if I walk out the door, the special was expired.  Even after I said no I was not interested multiple times, she continued to strong sale me and would not return my credit card to me!!!!\nI left feeling upset and very tense, which totally negated the massage that I just received AND I also did not get my credit card back!  I had to go back to get my card.\nWhat a hassle.  \nI felt like I should have been PAID to have been there instead of PAYING for the service it was THAT tortuous!!!!"
"1","Is this place still open? Their website has been down all week, and no one is returning my messages. We wanted to sign our child up after hearing such good things."
"1","Very unaccomodating and expensive!  If your kids cannot make it to camp one day of the week, they will not allow a makeup day and the price stays the same.  They charge a \""late fee\"" if you want to come the same day, and don't seem to care whether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more interested in money.  Gold Metal Gymnastics in Chandler, although a bit further, is a better option.  They are friendly, kind, and know that with children and our lives, things don't always work out exactly as we want.  Save your money and go to another camp that cares about families and kids, and not about nickel and diming you."
"2","This is our regular breakfast spot, food and service are good and consistent.\nWe usually get coupons in the mail.\n\nThey get 5 starts for their crispy bacon, it is awesome.\n\nOne of my favorites is the chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the King Kong for dinner. They have good sandwiches too."
"2","So this place is a diner and you get what you would expect,  burgers,  chicken fried steak,  breakfast all day, and of course shakes.  Can't complain if that's what you're looking for.  It's a great place for families with kids."
"2","If you like Cherry Blossom in Central Phoenix, you should thoroughly enjoy it's counterpart, Eastwind. Eastwind is one of my lunch go to spots because it is delicious, fairly-priced (you can get some of the same dishes as Cherry Blossom for cheaper) and has a friendly staff. \n\nMy list of must tries is simple. If you like Japanese curry, you gotta try the curry, rice and chicken katsu dish; it's fantastic and filling. The udon noodle soup is next on my list and is especially good if it's chilly outside; and I can't forget to say how good it is with shrimp tempura added to it. The best part about it is that it doesn't feel heavy or bog you down after eating it; you leave feeling re-energized. Last but not least is the lunch bento. Good lawd, it's scrumptious! Think of it as a sampler of sorts: you get your fish, your katsu, some miso, a salad and some rice. For $9 that's a lunch that'll fill you up and keep you full the rest of the day (unless you're not human of course, you pesky alien, you).\n\nGo here, eat the food, be nice to the staff and be prepared for a pleasant experience. It's a great place for a small group if you're into good atmosphere and Japanese cuisine."
"1","Not a good place for nigiri. I broke my rule of never eating sushi in a place where you can't see the fish before... well they reminded me why I have that rule. The portions were good but the fish didn't taste fresh."
"1","ouch they went WAYYY down in my ratings,\n\nservice was horrible, it took 10 minutes to get seated and it wasn't busy and there were empty tables everywhere... server took 15 minutes to get us waters, server forgot what i ordered and didn't even remember my soup till prompted that my food should come with it. (20 minutes after everyone else got theirs)\n\nfood under cooked, they served some of the steak strip cooked black and blue style...\n\nfood served COLD, not hot, not warm..but.. COLD!! gross\n\nwasabi is the crappy powder kind"
"2","There are two things here that I love that you can't really find anywhere else. The fried rice and the hakata ramen. I know you can find fried rice everywhere, but their's is just ... different. The ramen is my absolute fave ... I find myself craving it all the time. The service can leave something to be desired sometimes, but all the servers are very nice and you can usually tell they're trying. Nice little neighborhood place. :)"
"1","Wow, after reading everyones reviews, I know I'm right about our experience last weekend.  We've been going here to eat off and on over the past 7 years or so.  We've always enjoyed our meal. It's been about a year since we've gone. \n\nThe menu has changed somewhat so we couldn't order what we normally use to order.  Wow, terrible choice.  We decided to order light and just order a  spicy tuna and salmon roll for each of us.  They were so hot we couldn't eat them.  My husband didn't think the rice was made that well.  My husband and I never go home with take out when we go out for Sushi.  Out of 12 pieces each, we each ate 4.  What does that tell you?   I told the waiters working at the counter that it was to hot and they said that we ordered Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon.  No one said,  \""we're sorry, what can do we do for you to make it better\"". \n\nMy children who are in their 20's tried it and also agreed with us.   They are both avid sushi eaters.  I called the owner and talked to him personally that evening.    He said he would check into it for me and get back to me with what he found out.  He never did.  I called him a few minutes ago.    He said that his workers made it normal and that is the way they make it. They didn't put any extra hot spice in it.    I guess the customer is always wrong.  We will never step foot into this establishment and give them our money.  There are to many other sushi places  in the Scottsdale area to go out to eat.  The sushi rolls at Safeway are better and more enjoyable."
"1","I was using this cleaner for a few months, but not really sure why. The staff is rude and even worse, they jacked up my clothes. I asked for some repairs on two pairs of suit pants. Instead of fixing them, they sliced the butt of one of the pants and did not repair the other, while still charging me. Stupid me for not checking them before paying and going home. I don't trust them to fix it so I took them elsewhere. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."
"1","Had a few bad experiences unfortunately in just one visit. The associates had no intention on being courteous, they even seemed to run away or roll their eyes to avoid me. I had to walk to the cashier to ask for help,  she willingly helped me,  answered my questions.  When I was about to walk out, the alarm went off and I was NOT even close to the door, one of the associates quickly pointed me out,  and loudly said \""Can you come here I gotta check if their is anything in THERE\""  meaning my bag.  He gave me his back the whole time, and didn't even look at me to say I was good to go. He just said your fine. That's it. So rude."
"1","eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions."
"2","I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place!  \nSigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is $22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is $25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. \nThey also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. \nWhat I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. \nThere you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!!\nWell, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!"
"1","WORST AIRLINE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. \nWOULD NOT LET ME ON THE FLIGHT BECAUSE THEY OVERBOOKED IT, AND THEN REFUSED TO REFUND ME AND MY FAMILY....EVEN THOUGH I HAD A REFUNDABLE TICKET. \nBought flight tickets in January for a trip down the Grand Canyon that left the following morning at 6am. They canceled our flight in March and rescheduled us for a later flight. Then 3 days prior to our flight they told us they overbooked our flight and could only take 9 out of the 11 people they booked. After more than 15 calls to them including the corporate headquarters they said they absolutely would not compensate us for having to drive to our destination now, there was no way they could guarantee our flight unless arrived onsite 24 hours in advance (no more no less), and that they had no idea if or how they could refund our flight. Despite us having to miss our entire trip that cost thousands of dollars by telling us 3 days prior to our departure that they are unable to take us to our destination. They are also unfortunately the only airline that flys into this site. We arrived 3 hours before the plane took off, but they would not let us on the plane, and refused to refund our tickets. We lost all of the money, were stranded in page, and had to spend 400$ on a one way rental care to page. I would rather drive anywhere than deal with this airline ever again. Worst customer service. I can't imagine a less reliable company....in any part of the world."
"1","The tortillas are worth 4 stars, but I think the rest is overrated. The machaca always struck me as bland.  Same with the tamales.  I'd much rather go up the street to Ranch Market/Tradiciones.\n\nAnd the hours are frustrating. Closed Sundays and shuts down too early the rest of the week.  The Cactus location is open later, but the food is no better and the dining room is depressing."
"2","When I lived and worked in Phoenix, I had my first experience at Carolina's as a lunch trip with a coworker. She told me that they had the best tortillas and was fast enough to fit in our lunch break.\n\nI cannot tell you how delicious all their food is...flautas, enchiladas, combo plates, tacos. chimis, etc. Even though I'm back in Chicago, I dream about this place. I recommend it to my friends when they head to Phoenix area, and I hope that when I visit next, I have time to drive out for lunch.\n\nThe sauces are delicious and everything is homemade. They take pride in their food and are quick with the service. Delicioso!"
"1","Definite dive but the food was good.  They dont have carne Asada??!  That is weird to me...  Only green chile or red chile on the menu.  I was thinking- maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive- but then; there was tons of people in there so how can they NOT afford the meat when Filibertos has it??  Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but that's way too long for simple taco truck orders.  The salsa cups are like the size of a THIMBLE so I had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town and if it wasn't daytime with my stud of a BF, I would be concerned for my life and purse.  okay- back to the food.  The burrito was good.  The gauc is good.  It was all good but  the menu isn't something to RAVE about.  Im mexican so I could have made all the items on the menu by the time my ticket was called."
"2","it took me awhile to actually find this place.  but it was well worth the wasted gas.\n\nthe burritos, tacos, beans, rice are all good.  the food is top notch.\n\nif you go during lunch on a work week be prepared to wait in line to order and fight for an available table.  the food is worth the fight."
"2","Dumpy place, DELICIOUS food. Honestly, who cares what this place looks like. We ordered our food, sat at a table and waited for our number to be called. My kids were skeptical at first but the waft of greasy, deep fried burritos reached their nostrils and all sense of doubt faded in the blink of an eye. Mmmm, mmm, mmmmm....chimichanga heaven. Even though this place is clearly not a 5 star restaurant, I highly recommend it to everyone."
"2","Bring your cash and get the green chile!!! Good stuff!"
"2","great flavor\ngreat price\ndont let the 'atmosphere' scare you off"
"1","The food here was cheap and awful. The restaurant itself is poorly kept and uncomfortable. I will never eat here again. I would suggest only getting tortillas here if anything. Avoid the burritos and enchiladas honestly just a salty goopy consistency mediocre at best. I would not recommend this food to anyone."
"2","So far the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona, HANDS DOWN.\n\nI've lived in Arizona for 39 years.\n\nGo, go NOW.  Stop reading this and go, NOW."
"1","After an awesome experience with Lo-lo's, I thought I'd expand my horizon by trying out other soul food places in the area.\n\nBobby C's seem like a cool bar....but unfortunately, it wasn't so cool a place for dinner.  \n\nWe ordered fried catfish, fried chicken and country fried steak.  They came with sides of dirty rice, corn bread, green beans, collard greens and mac & cheese.  All the fried stuff were decently crispy, but somewhat unseasoned and not particularly memorable.  \n\nThe sides stood out more...but not in a good way.Rarely do I wish that a restaurant would use Kraft's blue box for the Mac & Cheese, but in this case it would have been an improvement.  The \""fresh\"" green beans has the distinct taste of a tin can.  Corn muffin was dry.  \n\nIt'll be hard to get me to stray from Lo-lo again"
"2","Bobby C's is what a neighborhood pub is all about.  The fact that it serves up soul food and hosts some amazing music is icing on the cake.\n\nBut what makes the family owned and operated bar & lounge stand out is the fact that, from the minute you walk it, until you leave, you're treated like a member of their family. with in minuted we were joking and kidding around, a few minutes later, we were being given a tour of the facility, including their overflow seating next door.\n\nUntil now, it's been a hidden gem with a loyal following of people into live jazz and R&B, or this looking to sate their southern food cravings.  However, with a light rail stop outside, I predict it will be getting a whole lot more attention, (Hint: it is a must stop venue for any Light Rail pub crawls)"
"1","We had an Appointment Saturday 04/26/14 for a estimate, no show no call. BS no customer service!!!"
"1","I only live about 15 minutes from the airport, so typically a cab is the easiest way to get home without hassling someone to pick me up.   I got into the cab and saw a credit card machine which was good because I only had $24 on me.   I told this to the cab driver and he got onto the freeway informed me that the machine doesn't always work, but  if it doesn't I'll take you to the closest ATM.... As a girl, it's not the most comfortable situation, getting cash while a cab driver is waiting in the car... with your belongings!  Unfortunately the cab fare was $28 and the machine wasn't working... so there I was at the ATM.  It ended up not being the most convenient options since it added about 15 minutes onto my trip and the $2.50 ATM fee.   The driver was nice, the cab was clean, but don't advertise that you take CC and not have the machine work!"
"1","TERRIBLE, DISGUSTING, THE WORST CAB COMPANY!!!\n\nIf only I could give this Zero or negative stars. I have used their services a few times while traveling to and from airports. I have ALWAYS had problems with their credit card machines. And the drivers refuse to acknowledge it.  They are never polite and courteous.\n\nBut today was the limit! First, like always the credit card machine could not read my card. After I tried two credit cards and it still didn't work, he said \""this is what all customers use, your card is bad\""...yeah sure! like my cards were faulty or something!!! Told him this is the same card I use everywhere else and always works. Then, I paid a 15% tip and he is like \""you guys don't know how to tip a driver???\""...I was shocked and disgusted. I replied that I had paid a 15% tip to which he started yelling at me about how drivers were hardly paid anything blah blah blah..and finally he yelled at me, \""go get your stuff yourself\"". I jumped out and pulled my luggage out of the trunk. As he drove by, I could see him swearing at me.  This is just unacceptable and very very unprofessional. Even if I had paid him a zero tip, which I should have, he had no right to talk like that to a customer. Please stay away from this company, they hire a bunch of jerks as drivers. I am DISAPPOINTED."
"1","Horrible, awful service. Was told a cab would be at my house in 20-25 mins. Called back after 30 to find that the driver had gotten lost, and so drove off to another pickup. Nobody shared that info with us. Was told that another cab would be along in 15 mins. Called after 20 minutes had passed to find that there was no cab designated for us. To top all that off, everyone we spoke to on the phone was rude, and sounded as though we were inconveniencing them."
"1","Prior reviews are right - if you want to take a cab ride home from Phx Sky Harbor you will end up in a yellow cab and it will be a shady experience.  There were yellow cabs lined up as far as the eye could see, it was 3am London time and I just wanted to get back to my car which I parked at my place of employment, corner of University and Mill - that's 5.16 miles for those who care.  Driver never started the meter (I expected the $15 flat rate, see prior comments) and when we arrived he wanted cash only and wouldn't tell me what I owed, instead saying most people pay $16 or $18.  I opted for $18 since this is exactly what I had paid going the other direction trip + tip.  \""Why not $20?\"" he says.  For the love of God, let me out of the cab!!!!!  I seriously don't want to dicker over the cost of the fare.  I'm still waiting for the $20 charge (yes I acquiesced in the name of ending the dickering) to clear my bank and am honestly petrified that some crazy alternate charge will show up instead.  What a racket!

"1","I must be one of those \""chumps\"" because I just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible. First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. \n\nWhen you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. \n\nProbably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type \""grilled steak\"" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?"
"2","Cheap and awesome.  Pulled pork is the way to go.  No Kool Aid, missed on that one.  Overall one of the best lunch spots in the area"
"1","I was not impressed with the sauce. And the beef seemed real greasy. Im use to sliced beef instead of shredded. Corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when I took it out of the wrapper. I just wasnt impressed at all. The people were friendly and was a clean facility."
"1","What a dreadul experience.  I had reserved and prepaid via Hotwire but all these folks do is PUSH PUSH PUSH for extras and more money.  I could hear it all around me. My agent took the cake (think her name was Angela).  I was in Phoenix for a little over a day, and was running late (good old USAirways, landed early but the gate was not free and we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour) for a tight business deadline.\n\nWould I like an upgrade - \""we have a really nice BMW for you\"" - how much is that? An extra $99 per day on top of what I had paid - no thanks.  Well I can get you something more comfortable, or fun like a Jeep Wrangler.  NO thanks, I just want what I paid for.  How about an SUV - No thanks.  I just want the car I reserved (mid-size).  Well sorry - it will be a long wait - the ONLY car available (I was in a hurry) was the darned Wrangler (noisy POS that I totally did NOT want but she was determined to put me in) and then talked me into insurance before she would let me go - with taxes etc $85 for 28 hours.  Never again - I guess I'll book directly with Avis next time in Phoenix.  I never want to use Budget there again.  Thanks Angela"
"1","Okay, the car rental hullabaloo often seems to pretty much suck. So I want to separate the whole aspect of renting a car (and the fact that for some reason the PHX rent a car place is about three hours away from the actual airport or something) to what was specific to Budget.\n\nThese guys are upselling sons of... you get it. I am so cognizant of this behavior and am pretty much an expert at declining all 3,456 things that they offered me or even pressured me into getting. However, even though I got into the type of car I'd expected without the supplemental insurance, and so on, my bill for the car the next day was TWICE THE COST of my quote from Egencia (the business travel version of Expedia). How is that possible?! It's always very spot on. There were SO many hidden fees and costs, way worse than all the other companies that I've rented from, that I will never rent from Budget again. :("
"1","Received a functioning car, drop-off was smooth.\n\nCheck-in, however, was ridiculous. Despite NO line, and half a dozen bored counter staff, it took a full 30 minutes to process an existing reservation and procure me an actual vehicle. For the first 10 minutes there was no indication of a problem. For the second 10 minutes, as I looked increasingly impatient while watching the staff member apparently program the space shuttle or possibly update his Facebook status for the 17th time, no indication of a problem and no apology for the time-wasting. For the third 10 minutes, there was a grunt about finding me a car of the appropriate reservation class, followed by an additional grunt about \""this would have been a lot easier if you hadn't made your reservation in Hotwire\"". Really? So if Budget accepts Hotwire reservations but has trouble processing them, that's the customer's fault?\n\nAlso - apparently the counter staff communicate with the car moving staff via push-to-talk cell phone. That's fine. Apparently the counter staff also do not know where the charger to said phone is, and spend lots of time yelling at each other about where it is. So, if that cell phone loses charge, does that mean nobody gets a car?  \n\nThis is my second poor Budget experience in a row in two completely different states. Lesson learned."
"1","Rented a minivan for a week online for $470. At pickup they tried every bait-and-switch and salesman trick in the book to increase the cost. They first claimed they had a Kia reserved for me (apparently because many people hate Kias and are willing to pay to upgrade) and I had to say \""no thank you\"" to upgrade requests about 6 times before they finally admitted they didn't actually have a Kia for me anyway but rather a Dodge Caravan. They initially charged me for extra insurance even though I said \""no\"" (be careful not to say \""basic\"" - that means the \""basic\"" level of extra insurance). The pickup was time consuming because of all of their tactics. They quoted me a higher price for adding an extra driver than what was stated on the Budget website. After finally rejecting all of the extras, they gave me a bill for $540, which I had to insist be recomputed because I would not pay more than the $470 I had been quoted online.\n\nThe vehicle I received was nice and clean but not well maintained. The windshield wipers were shot and the wheels were not well balanced (the steering wheel shook at highway speeds).\n\nI would rather pay a higher price elsewhere and not have to feel like I am defending myself against attempted scams."
"1","This place sucks lines are long and the people have no sense of urgency 15 minutes to process one customer and when they finish with the customer ,they walk out\n\nThey can pay two people to stand around and do nothing but call out numbers ...yes you have to take a number but they can't staff the desk with enough people so you don't have to stay in line for an hour"
"1","Stay away from this company! 60+ wait while other companies actually knew how to quickly do the job. Use any other company! Rude employees also!"
"1","On May 22, 2014 I agreed to rent a small car for 3 days. I was quoted a rate of $170.67 and the vehicle was priced at $36.00 per day. I returned the vehicle on May 25, 2014 only to be charged $415.75 and was being charged $44.00 per day. When I called to figure out why I was being charged an additional $245.75 I was told that the blonde lady who rented me the car up sold me on services I did not agree too. In fact, the whole time I was there I told her I could not afford more then $200.00 and she assured me that $170.67 is all I would be charge. Every question I asked she lied about costing me an additional $245.75. She lied about what would happen if I returned the car early and the amount of the rental. This was my first time renting with this company and it will be my last. They are completely negligent when it comes to customer service and will be deceitful when it comes to billing your account. Please be careful when renting from this company, they will drain your bank account."
"1","There was a 40 minute line for a car... And so many people waiting. I would anywhere rather than wait that long... Not recommended"
"1","The great thing about the New Times is that it is free. So, it's perfect for lining your pet bird's cage or puppy's kennel.\n\nThis \""paper\"" is so biased that I can no longer read it. I'm not affiliated with any political party and it is completely obvious that this is a total left wing publication. Any article I had read recently does not give a fair portrayal of its topic, thus not allowing the reader to make an informed decision. Instead, they infuse the liberal agenda into every story they run in what feels like an attempt to dumb down the city's population.\n\nIn my late teens I actually enjoyed reading the paper while waiting for the bus or whatever I was doing. In my early twenties I still humored myself with an article once in a while. Now, as I am approaching thirty years old, I will not even pick up their \""Best of Phoenix\"" editions."
"2","Got a craving for fish and chips? Best place in town I think. Great Fish and Shrimp."
"1","Just ok overall.  The hush puppies were OUTSTANDING.  Best I've ever had.  The fish, fries and zucchini lacked seasoning and were a bland - although I used some hot sauce to fix it."
"1","I'm sorry, what? This place was the worst! First of all, it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street.) The food is horrible! Horrible! Thick, bland, raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found. $4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder. Fries were soggy and bland. Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
"1","Ate here on a Friday night with a friend. When I drove up, I was a little worried as the area is very questionable. There was a sketchy-looking fellow just sitting waiting in a big SUV in the parking lot, so right away I was a bit unnerved.\nOnce inside, I felt a little better. The place was busy which is usually an okay sign.\n\nI ordered the 1 shrimp, 1 fish and chips combo. The shrimp was big and pretty good, the fish was your typical battered fillet without much flavor. I doused it in lemon juice and tartar sauce which helped a little. The fries could have been better. They kind of tasted like Ore-Ida fries from a frozen bag. So really the food part of the experience was just so-so at best, if not a bit bland. \n\nI do have a bone to pick with the presentation of the restaurant though. What's the story with the handwritten signs covering almost every empty space of the wall? 'Do this, don't do that..' it's like they are so afraid of being sued that they came up with every possible less-than-desirable scenario that could possible take place whilst eating out and made a sign for it. To me it just came across as grumpy management. And then there are the sub-par pixelated photos slapped on the back of the booths. It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, \""that works.\"" \nAs a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.\n\nDO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity."
"1","this place blows. how many shoe and embossed Jesus picture dealers do you need? if you're in the market for bootleg stuff and grey market goods this is the place. Could count on one hand how many used stuff dealers there were. save your $2."
"2","I brought my Moen white/ brass roman tub spout to be refinished brushed nickel to match my recently updated bathroom fixtures. Unfortunately, I discovered after leaving the tub project for last, Moen no longer makes a replacement for older spouts. My only options were to replace the entire tub and fixtures for $1000, keep the old fixtures that clashed with the new ones or have the spout re-plated.\n\nI was reluctant to use Papago Plating after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, but went ahead with the order anyway. If you are looking for immaculate antiseptic office\nthis may not be the place for you. However, the business looks like a typical small job-shop one might find anywhere. The lady that waited on me was very pleasant, knowledgeable and accurate with the final cost and completion date. It took one week and only cost $42. \n \nWow! Papago Plating did a fantastic job. The spout matches the new tub handles perfectly."
"2","OKAY...\n\nSo on my connecting flight home, i once again landed at Sky Harbor. \nI had a great weekend, i was exhausted, and i suppose I didn't have much energy to hate on everything.\n\nSecond look at Sky Harbor, it's not so bad.  I suppose i wasn't in such a grumpy mood for having to stay here for 5 hours again.  Although I do still hold up to my previous statement that seating is a bit limited and that there aren't many food choices...but an airport is an airport right?  \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get an opportunity to check out the Art Museum suggested by a fellow yelper (yes, they have an art museum!) but I was just glad to be on my way home. \n\nAnd this airport is HUGE. I was lucky enough to have landed in A second time around because my connector was in A, but last thursday, i landed in B and trekked all the way to A to reach my connector. It was quite a walk."
"2","Flying 10+ times a year on average, I couldn't do it out of any airport besides Sky Harbor.  Using terminal 4 exclusively, I've never had a wait longer than 10 minutes going through security (Flying out mainly on Friday afternoon or early Monday morning.)  Food choices are plentiful around the terminal inside and outside of security (I am disappointed Burger King doesn't have the BK Stacker there.)  People movers are a quick way to get around or you can tip the guy to drive you right to your gate.  The decor is nice and warm compared to others (SFO.)\n\nGetting here is very easy and the Cell lot is a great place to wait for arriving passengers.  The $2 for parking is worth it sometimes just to meet people at security so you don't feel so rushed to get baggage and say hello.  All and all, good job Phoenix."
"2","unlike some airports where you have to pay for wireless *cough, sfo, *cough...sky harbor offers it for free.\nthat being said, they had me at free wireless.\nin addition, they also have a wendy's...\nso not only can you write a yelp review, and/or update your facebook status, and/or tweet (twitter?) ; you can also do so while enjoying a chocolate frosty. with fries. not that that's what I usually do....\nglad that's been established. \n\nanyway, they also offer stores where you can purchase crucial items such as a cactus shaped lollipop or a magnet that says: someone who loves me went to arizona and brought me back this magent...\n\nthank you sky harbor for being the best airport on the west coast."
"2","This is one of the better International airports in America.  The baggage unloading can be a slow process at times, but security lines, especially in the Delta terminal, go by in a flash!  My flights have always left on time, and I really, really appreciate the free WiFi!\n\nPHX is great!"
"1","I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times."
"1","Watch the signs for rental car return it is a little confusing.Took me 40 minutes to get from Hyatt place airport to rental car returns."
"1","Had a layover here....3 hours!!!! Did not enjoy it. Bathroom floors are sooo sticky and dirty. There are no really good places to eat. When you book a flight advice is to avoid this airport!!"
"1","Oh I am spoiled with the small-town feel of Tucson International--now if they wold only get some quality flights!!\nI've never flown out of Sky Harbor.  Seems like any other large-scale airport on the surface.\nSo why only two stars?  The driving around to find where to park is horrible.  They need to remember that most people don't frequent the airport.  So they should be obvious and deliberate with the signage.  \nAlso, the elevator from the parking garage to the terminals is a little confusing.  It literally went from floor 3, to 2, to B, to A, to 1.  Alpha-numerics embedded within themselves?  Again, keep it simple for us dummies who don't live the commuter jet-set lifestyle."
"2","\""I'm goin goin back back to Cali Cali\""...ok, I HAD to do that...moving on...!\n\nThe last thing anyone wants to do is be at the airport on the morning of Christmas Eve, hungover, and with a little less than three hours of sleep. However, Sky Harbor Intl. Airport made my absolutely horrendous morning bearable and then some.\n\nI was expecting long lines when I checked in my bags at Southwest but it was surprisingly fast and efficient. I felt that my things were in good hands. I thought, \""this is too good to be true! Security has to have crazy long lines!\"" Nope,  I was wrong. Security was a breeze. No lines. It all went by quite smoothly and it was nice of them to high-five me and wish me a safe flight. I think they could tell I was hungover and on zero sleep, but nevertheless, it was a sweet gesture.\n\nYou'd think at 8 a.m. there would be millions of people at the airport but it was surprisingly very quiet. Stopped to get some food and a much needed cup of coffee and before I knew it, I was on my way back to the bay. Thank you Sky Harbor for making my trip from AZ back to CA effortless and stress-free!"
"1","I strongly dislike this airport. I had to catch a connecting flight from Phoenix to Maui in another terminal. I had no idea I had to leave security, catch a bus, and then go through the TSA line again to get to the other terminal. I have an especially bitter taste in my mouth for Sky Harbor because this is where I lost my college class ring! In my mind the only redeeming part of Sky Harbor is Bar Fly, the coolest airport bar ever."
"1","Your basic airport. Nothing special to get excited about."
"1","Phoenix Sky Harbor, I've seen your plans for light rail connecting the terminals and the rental car center and they look glorious. 2015 can't come soon enough though --- the rental car center transportation (and the rental car center itself) as it is now is the worst I've seen.\n\nWhy is it the worst you ask?\n- the shuttles from the terminal to the RCC and from the RCC to the terminals wait until they are mostly full to leave which means you could be sitting on the shuttle for 15 minutes before it even gets moving. Other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move.\n\n- there are a lot early flights out of PHX (like get to the airport no later than 4am flights) and there are hardly any staff around at that time so everything us slower than usual. The last thing I want to do is get up even earlier to deal with that...\n\n- the garages are massive and not well signed... You keep driving and driving in it trying to leave or return your car thinking, did I miss it? Until 8 minutes later you see a sign with tiny lettering pointing you in the next direction.\n\nAll I can say, fellow Yelpers, is that I wish you luck and recommend you build an extra 30-45 minutes if airport time into your trip if you're renting a car.\n\nThe airport itself is fine. Not a huge airport, the food options are regular old airport food options. The baggage claim/ticketing/security areas are all fine. Nothing special or awesome but no real complaints. The nice thing about flying through PHX is that there are rarely flights delays due to weather!"
"1","The airport is clean and looks like its been recently renovated. I'm not really fond that the rental car location is 10  minutes away though. Also, i dislike how you have to do a full body scan and get your fingers swiped for bomb stuff.. its like... really? out of all the airports ive been to, this is the only one that made me do it. lastly, the US airways employee at the airport booked me the wrong flight.!!! she gave me a ticket but when she put us in teh system, it was to a different place. we ended up staying in phoenix another night since there were no more flights back to so.cal.. NOT COOL! AND, they wouldnt even cover the cost of the hotel. They only offered a discount.. suppppppper lame!"
"1","Poor service, long check-in process and time...total hassle. Will never, ever rent from them again."
"1","I hate this airport more than I could ever tell you. Sure, the wifi is free, and progress through the security checkpoint is brisk, but these are the only positive things I can say about PHX. The food sucks, the buses are confusing, getting out of here is a giant pain in the butt, and if you are a Continental customer you will be relegated to the Continental Ghetto (Terminal 2) which is by far the grossest, dingiest, most run-down of the bunch. The best part of coming to Sky Harbor is flying to another state."
"1","Very confusing airport.  For an International Airport, I would have expected a more luxury feel.  Definitely not the airport you would want to get stuck for hours in.  I flew southwest and Gate C and D did not have great restaurant choices or stores to look in.  You have to walk what feel likes miles to buy a water or grab a magazine, and food."
"2","I'm a Flight Attendant based here, so I'm here quite a bit.  I love how easy it is to access Sky Harbor from the Freeways and 44th St., so it's always quick to get in and get out.  Parking is also easy.\n\nThe TSA folks tend to be fairly nice here, but be warned that the customs area is very, very small and you can get held up for a while when the once-daily British Airways 747 lands."
"2","Sky Harbor is a good airport, it really is, but no match for my beloved Tucson International. I can't recall many poor experiences here, thank god! It's easy to get through, not too massive, nor too small (but Iike small). It's a pleasant airport. But Sky Harbor smells like Cinnabon and Burger King on every corner and every terminal, so I'm sorry, but I'm knocking a star for that! I don't mind the pizza hut smell though :) If Sky Harbor got a little facelift in the food department, I'd be glad to give a sold 5 stars!"
"1","It's an airport, and you don't (ordinarily) spend a lot of time there, so why review? First, on the arrival, our baggage took an INORDINATELY long time to come out. It was just ridiculous. I am accustomed to long waits at DFW (where no one actually works in baggage retrieval). But here it was even worse. There was no organization and throngs of people stood around and then scurried to another carousel as changes were announced. We waited and waited and waited forever. The second gripe is that the TSA seems to be inconsistent with practices followed in every other airport I have used in the rest of the US. That may be the TSA and not the airport's fault, but why here? Overall, my experience was less than favorable."
"1","Putrid. Pathetic.  Podunk.\n\nToo big not to have some method of transportation of from the jets to the puddle jumpers. I check everything except a computer bag and purse so that's fine but God forbid you fly carry-on and don't have a wheely bag. \n\nI was wearing brand new tennis shoes--Saucony--and still it was a long walk after the NY flight landed late. If your destination is Scottsdale and you're coming from LA or SF or SB and don't want to drive, then fine. To transfer through this Third World dump--having been warned--well, you get what you deserve. \n\nWhen I got to SB, I met a Ph.D. in English who went through program after I did but is my age who told me that this was her least favorite airport in America and that the only reason she flew US Air was that it saved her over 300 dollars so she figured she would suck it up. \n\nThe carpet should have been on that famous Dateline segment about germs as it looks like the 1980s carpet which used to be in the outside ladies' locker room at Santa Barbara Athletic Club which caters to swimmers. (Whoever decided carpet would be a good idea in the swimmers' locker room needs immediately to get out of the interior design or consulting biz, by the way.) \n\nThere are no words for how bad this place is. It makes Punta Cana, Dominican Republic look like the Maui Four Seasons. The food sucks. The US gate people suck and they don't speak Spanish and I had to help this wonderful, older Mexican couple get on the plane to SB after they'd missed the connection to Santa Maria and NO US Air gate attendants (NOT flight attendants who might be from anywhere) could speak the language a huge percentage of Phoenix residents do. \n\nI am merely repeating the sentiments of Charles S: \""Old, ugly, worn out and dirty. Time to replace the carpet and the furniture, y'all.\"""
"2","Crazy busy airport with long wait times at security. Plan ahead! \n\nThat said however, this is a pretty decent airport. There are plenty of food options with both local and national chains, there are cute stores to buy Southwest themed treats, toys and take-homes, and the walkways (once you're through security) are pretty wide. I also found the bathrooms to be tidy as well as the carpets in the gate areas. I know that's odd to mention but dirty carpets really gross me out and this airport seems to be nicer than many I've been to recently. Go PHX!"
"1","Wish I could have avoided this airport not going to lie...  doing the 3 total hours I was here I heard over 5 different delays on arrivals and departures.  the pictures help out ALLOT....  it sums it up long hall ways with nothing to look at in them halls either...  it takes about 10-20 minutes to walk from 1 end to the other and during that walk, i'd like to at least listen to some music or something but they had nothing...\nMaybe its because I'm so use to Denver International Airport \""DIA\"" but this airport doesn't even compare.\nJust Saying"
"2","I mainly fly out of Terminal 2 and 4 (guess my alliance... ha!), so that's what all my opinions are based on.\n\nTerminal 4 is larger/newer and now has the SkyTrain from the economy parking to it, which is surprisingly more convenient than I though, so maybe it's not a complete waste of money. Although, you still need to take shuttles to the rest of the terminals.\nThe signage is rather clear for the most part, but if you are part of any of the premium boarding groups, sometimes the signs are either not very clear or missing. Seems to have gotten better lately though. Baggage claim area has large screens telling you which carousel has your flight's luggage (foreshadowing for Terminal 2 right here). If you are being picked up by someone, remember that there is both a North and a South side of the arrivals area, so be clear where you are going to be right away, besides just naming the door number.\n\nTerminal 2 should just be a regional airport of its own. It sure got the conveniences of one. The signage for initial security check point is Flight Crews, First class and the rest. Do note, First Class is actually for most Premier flyers and TSA PreCheck as well. Not that anyone can tell you that.\nThe 4 baggage claims carousels (in theory) show the flight number of where the luggage is coming from, but so far it at best displays late, or more often is announced over the speaker and for most fun occasions, on the wrong carousel altogether. At the very least, there is only one side to the terminal, so you don't have to tell North/South to your heat stricken friends when they pick you up.\n\nFood/entertainment choices are nothing exception in either of the terminals and are typical airport food."
"1","Awful place to have a layover. This airport is always overcrowded, hence, there is little seating and you'll likely find yourself squished between two strangers until your flight. To avoid the crowd, I recommend grabbing a book and finding a restaurant with bar seating to enjoy some quiet and a few drinks before boarding."
"1","Been flying in and out of this airport for the past 6 yrs.  The only positive thing about this place is that it's right off the freeway.  With that said, they have the ABSOLUTE worst check-in process at the security gate.  There's no getting around it.  You'll be in line for a solid 45 min to an hour so plan accordingly."
"1","This place just brings the rage out in me. It NEVER fails..whenever I have a layover here, my flight gets pushed back three times for an average delay of 3-4 hours...so you don't get out of there till almost 1am!! For a DOMESTIC flight! Thanks, US Airways! \n\nThe food court is pretty gross, still. The staff at the Starbucks over by B15A is pretty rude and then the departure screens don't update when your gate has been changed. I usually end up extremely stressed out by the time I'm outta this hell hole. Sadly, PHX is ALWAYS the place I have to connect through to get home because US Airways seems to love torturing their guests with this location. And...for an airport in an extremely hot place, how do you not have your HVAC system working properly?!"
"2","Our flight was on time! That right there is enough to give any airport at least 3 stars. On top of that, we ran into no problems with anything! Even the TSA agents were friendly, which is totally unusual yet very much appreciated! There's not much as far as food is concerned if you go in the morning; make sure you aren't even the slightest bit hungry before going because there's nothing really to eat. Both my dog and I had a positive experience. Way to go, Phoenix!"
"2","Dropped off my cousin here for their flight to California. The parking is not a hassle and a lot of things has changed since I remembered back in high school. Everything was under construction, caution tape everywhere, and just looked unappealing. Taking the time to actually tour around the place it is pretty nice and impressive. You got a variety of stores, lounging areas, and of course the restaurants. Very nice because it is still improving and still building more restaurants there. \n\nThe baggage and check in stations are very easy to do and don't need much help. That is a big part for me because airports can be very busy so the less time checking in the better. So, overall, I'd have to say even though I haven't been to a lot of airports Sky Harbor by far has to be one of the best in categories ranging from being clean, exceptional service, and having a variety of stores/restaurants."
"1","Worst airport for baggage claim. They move carousels all the time and take forever to deliver the bags. Should be so much easier than what they make it."
"2","Big airport.  Reasonably efficient for its size.  Way better than O'Hare for general amenities"
"2","Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is passable and they do a good job as expected, however it is a typical airport. No muss or fuss."
"2","On more than one occassion I have had to park here. It is not a bad price, but now I see they have coupons, and I am going to have to start getting those.\nWe are all into not spending too much $4 lately. \nWell, at least this week, hee hee.\n Anyway,  had cut my time short on my last trip. So I did not think that I would be able to make my check in time for my flight. But, I got there parked ,got to level 3 and thru security with time to spare.\nGreat I know~!\nFast ,quick and easy. I just need to get those coupons and fast."
"2","Okay, this was my first time at Phoenix Greyhound Park and my first time watching dog races (unless I can count watching All Dogs Go to Heaven - because I have seen that countless times). Any ways, I would definitely go again and I would totally recommend Phoenix Greyhound Park. \n\nLike I said, I have never done this before - so I had no clue how to bet or what to bet on. There was this VERY helpful man named Chuck who broke down the beats to me and my friend and really helped us get started. I won 5 times, but still walked away $6 short from when I started...it takes real skill to be that good... :o) At first, since I didn't really know what I was doing, the races were a little confusing to me, but after 4 hours and a few wins later, I was yelling my dismay and excitement with the rest of the crowd! At about 10pm (when my friend and I assumed the old folks home buses came and packed up their clientele) The atmosphere was still lively and it was still fun! Though, I would say that's because 99% of the people who were there were probably also pure blood Hockey and Nascar fans...so they know how to have fun (in their own way! :)) \n\nTo say the least I had a blast with the betting, dog races and family friendly environment - the reason for my mid-rating has more to do with the quality of food service. I think we saw our waitress about 4 times the whole 5 hours we were there...when the food finally came it was really good (don't waste your money on the desserts), but I was thirsty pretty much the whole time. I'm giving them a little bit of a break because I think for the whole room (200 tables) they only had 2 waitresses, so they were spread thin and we were up and down making our bets any ways. \n\nOh, and by the way, when you go, be a big spender and pay the $3 bucks a person and go up stairs, that's where all the fun is (and you get to ride the escalator)!"
"1","Wow, what a horrible experience. So bad that I had to cancel my reservation for my stay on the way back.\n\nI stayed here with my two children for one night in March. We got in kind of late and checked in around 9:30 pm. Check-in was fine. We let the clerk know we needed a ride to the airport in the morning and it turns out that you can leave your car there if you're planning to stay on your return trip and the stay is 14 days or less (I asked after a friend informed me you can do this--beats paying for airport parking!). We were flying to Hawaii and would be gone for 10 days, so this was a good deal.\n\nOur room was on the ground floor and was not nicer than a Motel 6 as far as I remember Motel 6s being from when I was a kid. It was hot and humid in the hotel so I turned on the AC. That clanky piece of crap managed to wake me up every single time it went on during the night. A HORRIBLE night of sleep.\n\nTo make matters worse, there were a bunch of college-aged drunk kids staying in the hotel who showed up around 10:30 pm. They hung out right outside of my door and were up and down the stairs laughing and being obnoxious until 1 am. I typically am not shy about sticking my head out the door and telling people to be quiet, but since I was alone with my kids, I didn't think it was the best idea. I called the front desk around 11 pm and they said their driver (who doubles as security) would drive back there when he returned from the airport, in about 20 minutes. It was not 20 minutes, that's for sure. Considering we had to be up at 5 am, waiting ANY amount of time was infuriating. They should have had someone on the premises who can act in the capacity of a security guard or something. I heard the van drive by around 1 am and that's when the inconsiderate a-holes finally went up to their rooms.\n\nIn the morning (at 5 am) I couldn't help myself and as we were heading to the front desk to catch the shuttle, I knocked loudly on one of the doors of the worst offenders and called them jerks. Passive aggressive, I know, but whatever. In the lobby, while waiting for the shuttle, I heard other guests complaining about the loud jerks, too.\n\nThe shuttle ride was fine; the driver was a nice guy. There was no way in hell, though, I'd be staying there on our way back. I was worried about my car the entire time we were gone and I didn't cancel my reservation until the day we were supposed to leave HI and stay there again. We got into PHX around 10:30 at night and we waited for the shuttle with about 5 other guests who were staying there. Shuttle after shuttle came for other hotels and ours didn't show up until 11:20 pm. I didn't want to draw too much attention to us since we weren't planning to stay so I didn't complain much. When we got to the hotel, I tipped the guy well and we booked it to the back of the hotel to my car. Thankfully, my car was fine and we made the 10-15 minute drive to a much nicer place--the Hilton Garden Inn. That place cost about $80 more and the AC was still not very quiet, but the hotel was quiet and I turned off the AC and surprisingly wasn't hot. Anyway, that's another review.\n\nI will NEVER stay here again. Ever."
"2","Hotel was extremely accommodating and the staff was very helpful. The airline lost our tickets after wed checked out and the next flight wasn't for 8 hours. Not only did they send a shuttle to pick us up bit they also let us check back into our room."
"2","Get the new york strip sandwhich for lunch, awesome. Great business lunch place"
"1","I want to start off with saying that everytime I drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big, plain, white building, I always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground. \n\nIt's totally not.  It is like a rich Texan's house inside.  Cow rug, leather, old cowboy photos on the wall.  So the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel.  We got sat in the main dining room and I also want to add like I felt like the place was \""dusty\"" I don't know why, or what made me feel this way, but \""dusty\"" was what I got from the place.  I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. Travis got a burger with fries. So- my ribs were just \""okay\"" and my potatoes were SUPER SUPER garlic-ey and it was weird how they were plated.  They came out like in a square shaped form of scalloped potatoes.  Like my mom makes potatoes and squares my piece out for me sort of square.  The square was small, but actually I didn't even like the potatoes so that did not bother me too much.  OH! and \""cole-slaw\"" my other side I ordered was \""cole-slaw\"". Notice how I put \"" \"" around this word \""cole-slaw\"".  I do that because it wasn't cole-slaw AT ALL!?!?!? It was literally just shredded up dry cabbage!?!??! So... yeah, didn't eat the slaw.  We finished our meals and got up to see their famour bar that is completely hand carved and the murals on the walls are hand-painted and restored from like the 1900's so the bar was very cool. \n\nGo for a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't do dinner again."
"2","Best family owned company great service. They are reliable and very friendly and I try recommend them to everyone I know."
"2","My husband and I recently used Alaska Air to relocate to Hawaii with our 9 pets.  \n\nWith such an unusual case, we expected difficulties, but they were great.  The reps on the phone were extremely helpful, accommodating, and nice. \n\nWhen we arrived in Chicago the lady was very thorough checking us in, and made us feel comfortable leaving our pets in her capable hands.\n\nThe Seattle airport was the same good experience.  We really appreciated they provide cards for each of our pets to let us know they were all boarded.\n\nThe flight attendants on each flight seemed genuinely nice, and responded to all our inquiries regarding our pets.\n\nWe really appreciated their care towards our pets.  \n\nWe will definitely use them again when we visit family back on the mainland."
"1","I would give 0 stars if I could!  I am in the process of relocating from Phoenix to Seattle and due to the last minute notice of the move, I had initially moved out to Seattle with my car a month prior and then flew back to Phoenix to pack all my belongings and officially move to Washington. I knew that I would be needing a car while in Phoenix, and was really excited about the cheap deal I had found to rent a car with advantage. When I arrived at Advantage, I was told that because my driver's license still had an address of Phoenix I needed to provide a copy of my insurance in order to rent the car, which was not possible for me to obtain because it was located in Washington.  The rental reservation had been made two week prior, and no notice of this policy had been communicated to me. I explained my situation and the service attendant apologized and said that there was nothing they could do, which left me carless and having to go to another company and pay over 5x the amount."
"1","We turned to Greyhound to get from Phoenix to Tucson. We were going to rent a car, but picking up in Phoenix and dropping off in Tucson for 5 days was over $600 at one of the cheaper rental car agencies. That seemed crazy, so we bought one-way tickets on Greyhound for 3 passengers for about $40. \n\nWas there a better deal online? Interestingly enough, the internet special costs more. \n\nWould we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead? No, but Mr. L bought our tickets a week ahead anyway, since the 2:30pm Sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us. He printed out our tickets, which said we were confirmed. That Sunday would be Daylight Savings, but it was Arizona, which didn't have a time change.\n\nThat Sunday when we showed up at 2pm for our 2:30pm bus, we learned that they'd changed the time to 1:30pm. The Daylight Savings in other states affected the schedule. We should have confirmed our \""confirmed\"" tickets. The station agent changed us to a 5:30pm bus, and we were bummed that we'd have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with Mr. L's parents. And they'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot.\n\nLesson learned? Buying tickets ahead with Greyhound isn't the best idea. If you do, confirm them, as the schedule may change.\n\nWith hours to kill in the Greyhound Station, my son started playing video games at $1 a pop, and Mr. L and I gathered our thoughts. There was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the Cactus Caf\u00e9. We rented two lockers to stow our luggage for $3 each for 3 hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station.\n\nWhen we returned closer to our new departure time, the lines for the buses were confusing. The line for Tucson was not the line for our bus. It seemed like everything was backwards here. Luckily we asked, or we might've missed our bus again. By the time we boarded our bus, many seats were taken. Ichabod headed to the back of the bus, and a kind gentleman cleared the 3-seat rear spot for us. \n\nThere was a bathroom near the back, which Mr. L suggested I avoid entering. He said it was a basic hole (outhouse style) with an empty jar of hand-sanitizer. Good to have the bare-bones bathroom if you really need it, but ick.\n\nThe driver made a bunch of announcements in English, then in Spanish. He meant business. I was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music, since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music. Now we only got to see his seated dance moves, which were actually pretty good. \n\n+2 affordable prices\n+2 capable driver\n-2 changing the schedule after had a \""confirmed\"" ticket\n-1 for only one agent working the line \n+2 having a bathroom on bus\n-1 condition of bathroom\n+1 lockers in Greyhound station\n-1 for the clusterf*ck of confusion of lines to get on buses - advanced degrees don't help here, be ready to ask questions\n\nGrand total: 2 stars\n\nOverall, we were glad not to spend over $600 on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride. We learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets last-minute like most Greyhound riders. Hanging out in a Greyhound station is not my idea of fun. We would ride Greyhound again, but proceed with caution."
"1","the fist time ever ridding a bus......st Los Angeles statio where i was leaving from was great. But when i arrived to phoenix i had the most horrible experience. The lady name Elsa or some thing like that was ordering  tacos while i was in front of her face. I was tiring to get  to Tucson Arizona i just wanted to buy a ticket and the lady did not listen she was really rude.... not riding grey hound ever in my life again the bus was nasty, smelled bad, to crowded, loud ,GHETTO."
"2","We only go here for their Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich and cookies. I should probably reverse the order of that because the cookies are the real treat and we always take advantage of their two for one cookies.  A pet peeve we have is that the staff is trained to remind people that they already get a chocolate chip cookie with their sandwich  when they order an EXTRA chocolate chip cookie, so it is always like a \""who's on first\"" banter until they figure out we really do want EXTRA chocolate chip cookies. Their staff seems to turn over a lot here so it is hard to deprogram them. We stop here EVERY time we are headed out of town anywhere near lunch time. Paradise is like a treat we look forward to before we get on an airplane. If we are running late, we just get it to go and eat on the airplane and make everyone jealous that they did not stop at Paradise too...especially when we pull the cookies out of the bag! Yum! They have recently opened another satellite location in Terminal 4 out by the C11-20 gates. We usually stop at the main one on Level 3."
"1","I love the idea of loving this place.  I really do.  And to be honest, if I was reviewing this place on it's own merits and not the clientele - I'd probably give it 3 stars as it delivers what it promises.  \n\nThis place is an old horse track through and through.  Fun way to waste an afternoon and decent amount of money on sucker bets.  Beer is not overly expensive and if you catch it on $1 hotdog night - you can add gluttony to your list of sins for the day.\n\nThat said, this place is an old horse track through and through.  Desperate need of a face lift when it comes to the grandstand / restrooms.  \n\nLastly, I really wish this place was 18+ or at least had rules about children being left unattended.  As it has neither (or least doesn't enforce either) this is a playground for FANTASTIC parents who let their children go Lord of Fly's while they gamble away their afternoon.  But alas, drink enough - and they're just blurs in the background with makeshift spears."
"1","I was not feeling the crowd (waaay out of my age range and I'm old *Yikes* ) maybe it was the day we chose to come? Who knows... \n\nService sucked. The waitress forget our order and 45 min (YES, 45 min) went by and we had no food until we stopped her. Nothing was comped. We ordered Salad's and Sandwiches. Wait, I think...Ugh, what does it matter won't be going back. \n\nThis place needs a remodel.."
"2","I called Monday morning during a heat wave and said that our unit was not cooling down as much as it should a hot afternoon.  They said they either could come out in the afternoon or the next day, which--considering we still had a/c and it was cool at night--was fine.  They did keep in touch (it was the next day), and I found the technician to be on-time and responsive.  (Some freon just needed to be added.)  The service call was $65 and the lb. of freon $25, so it was very reasonable.  He told me the techs work by the hour and not on commission like some companies, so they don't try to sell you something they don't need.  I definitely would use this company again."
"2","We went on a Saturday night in early May. It wasn't too crowed, but there was a good crowd there. A few of the rides were closed. I found out that I'm a screamer on the big coasters, and since I had to take my glasses off I just kept my eyes closed.I also learned that I am not cool enough to drive a bumper boat. \n\nWe didn't play golf or really take advantage of the arcade. \n\nWe got in on a group deal so the price wasn't too bad, and I felt that the snack bar was reasonably priced as well. We decided that we would come back again."
"2","I love the programs offered at Yong Champions of America! They keep the programs affordable while still giving great attention to each member of the class. The coaches seem knowledgeable on the arts, and I trust their abilities to teach. The classes are affordable, but we all know life happens sometimes, and the scholarship opportunity has been a huge help! I am so thankful that the focus of the program is on each student's opportunity to perform and improve, not on creating competition and tension. With karate, cheerleading, soccer, and dance, I know there are plenty of opportunities for trying new things!"
"1","We didn't order from this Domino's.   Southwest Airlines ordered for us and about 100+ other passengers that were stuck at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport for about 5-6 hours.  I believe they ordered 75-80 pizzas and it did turn out to be enough to feed all of us.   \n\nWhen the Domino's people showed up, some were ready to hug them, cause they were hungry.  And I will admit I was one of them.   We had so much weight in carry on luggage that trying to go get food was difficult, so what was offered free by Southwest was welcome.     I believe they sent 4 employees and used an airport cart to bring all the pizzas in.  The pizzas were not very hot, just lukewarm and that's no surprise as I don't think their ovens can rotate over 20 large pizzas at a time and we as a group had at least 3 or 4 times that many.   The pizza also had that signature cardboard smell and taste of the dominos boxes, but at the time it was so damn good.    \n\nThey didn't bring enough cheese packets and no red pepper, but there were enough napkins, people were very civil in line and we had enough to eat for hours.   It was even still acceptable after it was cold as room temp.   And anyone that has ever been in college knows that room temp pizza is just fine.   ;)"
"2","$20 and 20 minutes to get two tires mounted and balanced, as well as some angled valve stems put in (which I provided.. although they provide regular valve stems at like $1-2/pop).  That is just ridiculous.  Excellent service, great pricing, and a super friendly staff make Bob's the place to go.  I'll be sure to come here again for all future parts and services."
"1","I have gone to this Firestone location twice for oil changes in my Mustang.  The first time, I got no sticker indicating the month / mileage I needed to get another oil change at.  I didn't notice until I got home.  It's full synthetic so not that big a deal -- annoying but I just marked the calendar in my blackberry to remind me a few months down the road.  \n\nThe second time, the tech had oil on his boot and when he put his feet on the drivers side floormat to bring the vehicle back around after the oil change, he got oil all over it.  I was on the phone when I got back in the vehicle and, again, didn't notice.  My loss, because it's permanently stained. I had the floormats professionally shampooed afterwards but it didn't help.    Fortunately, it was just the floormat, not the actual carpet.\n\nTwo careless and annoying mistakes in two visits = two stars and no third chance."
"1","Terrible experience. I wish I could give negative stars or no stars. Placed an online order and paid with a credit card recently. The driver was 20 mins late! The pizza and wings were not hot. We called this location advised that our order is late and food was lukewarm. The person that answered advised that they were busy, didn't apologize and supposedly gave a $5 credit for our next order. \n\nDays later, looked at my credit card account statement and was CHARGED AN EXTRA $3!!!! This is CC fraud! Best believe I contacted this location very upset. Supposedly they are firing the delivery driver because we are the second caller to report this kind of incident. Makes me wonder how many other innocent people they are doing this to and other things. Businesses like this do not deserve to be open. If this is a franchised location, shame on the person running this. This is not a way to run a business. Maybe just simply hire deserving, trust worthy people that do their job.  \n\nIf anyone has to order from this Pizza Hut for whatever reason: Words of advise - check your order, keep track of the time from when your order was placed and pay in cash."
"2","I just found something else incredible about Ranch Market, and I'm going to have to up it to 5 stars as a result. Wednesdays are special produce days, which means that tons of different produce items are on special for 3 pounds for $.99. Yes, my friends. $.99. \n\nI had seen the special pricing advertised on the flyers we get every now and then, but had been hesitant to make a special trip there in case the produce was bad-quality or ran out after, say, 10 am. Well, I went today around 1 pm, and I can tell you that the produce is neither bad-quality or gone after 10 am. There were tons of the special advertised items, and 90% looked super-fresh. \n\nI left with 2-3 pounds of bananas, tomatoes, peaches, key limes, and avocados, all of which cost me a mere $5.62. And just think - just yesterday, I spent $2 for 3 tomatoes at Whole Foods. I'll definitely be back at least every other Wednesday to snag some of these special deals."
"2","I made an appointment online the night of a heavy downpour that really started to come in at the damaged roof area.  I selected to be contacted ASAP and indicated PM as the best time to call.  They got back to me the next day at around 1:30pm, asked me questions about the damage, answered my questions and scheduled  an appointment.\n\nThe pricing was tough but for the quality of service and craftsmanship they provided, I think the price was an excellent value.  It's been over a year and a half and I've had no leaks or issues with the repairs.  We've had some pretty bad storms in the past year and everything's held up.\n\nI would recommend them to anyone looking for quality roof repair."
"1","I got food poisoning after eating a chicken burrito from this place about five years ago. I have never been back since. It also made me not want to eat a burrito from any other place. I slowly have eased my way back to enjoying burritos this year."
"1","On a recent trip to the Valley of the Sun (or Hell is what it should be called during this time of year), I thought I would get my Greek food fix by visiting Jay's.  Bragging about their *authentic* Greek gyros, I thought, surely they would compare to our great Greek restaurants in the pacific northwest serving delicious food that will make me want to cry.  Sadly, I wanted to cry but not in the way I had hoped.\n\nTheir servings are huge and you do get plenty for what you pay for.  Their gyros are gigantic and they don't skimp on the lamb or chicken.  But the flavor was a bit off.  It just wasn't up to par with other gyros I've had and it didn't come with lettuce!  I ordered their Greek salad w/chicken kabob and although the chicken was charbroiled just right, the flavor was again a bit off.  Also, I wasn't a fan of their tzatziki sauce.  It was a bit runny and tasteless for me.\n\nWhat really turned me off about this place was that we ate lunch here at 3p and Jay's closes at 4p.  Why did the owner and family begin to start cleaning the tables and giving us dirty looks at 3:30 making us feel like it was time to leave?  With their mediocre salad and inhospitality, I humphed my way out of the A/C and into the outside furnace."
"2","At first glance, my Yelp buddies may be thinking \""Finally!  She's put the lid on that can of crazy and adopted a new pet!  Too bad it needs a neurologist.\""  Well, no I haven't. That shows you what my list of unfinished reviews looks like.  So here's my review from my August 2011 visit.  Rest assured, it was so traumatizing I can accurately remember the pertinent details.\n\nAfter my kitty suffered a severe seizure, losing her eyesight, the emergency clinic recommended a neuro consult as they were unable to pinpoint the cause.    So we loaded up our already deaf, now blind, and extremely pissed off family member into the car and  headed from one hospital to another.\n\nThe facility is in an odd industrial area, but it was very clean and the staff friendly.  We were greeted promptly and had a minimal wait.  Suzi was first thoroughly examined by an resident.  She was minimally cooperative, but he was good with her.  He then took her to another room for a second examination by a neurologist, Dr. Evans.  We were not offered the opportunity to accompany Suzi, but we were not exactly at the top of her list anyway.  Following Dr. Evan's exam, he did meet with us to report his findings.  His best guess was a brain tumor, but in absence of an MRI, he could not be certain.  We discussed treatment options; however, as she was already 19, I was not willing to consider surgery or radiation.  He suggested a course of steroids which could reduce any swelling causing the blindness.\n\nThe only thing preventing me from a 5-star review was the topic of the MRI.  While I did not feel pressured, I was encouraged to move forward with it for a definitive diagnosis even after I expressed concern over her age and current weakened state following the seizures.  I asked if the MRI were positive what conservative treatment was available.  The answer...a course of steroids, the same thing if it were negative.  I fully understand it was their obligation to communicate all available diagnostics and treatments available, but I also understand that I could have easily been swayed to spend $3000 just for peace of mind in my case.\n\nThe steroids did appear to help as Suzi's sight returned and she had 3 more months seizure-free.  Dr. Evans' best guess diagnosis appeared to be accurate, as she did exhibit additional symptoms pointing to a brain tumor just before we euthanized her.  I would not hesitate to trust this facility again should the need arise."
"1","I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity.\n\nThey are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible. \n\nI cannot recommend it for lunch."
"1","Definitely not one of the nicer Hiltons I've stayed at, but close to the airport...so its convenient and the inside of the place is nice enough.  Not the place you want to leave ANY valuables in your car though...the parking lot is dark in a lot of places, spaces can be finicky finding depending how busy they are and it's not in the greatest area of town.\n\nIn fact it was kind of comical...I left the hotel in the evening to grab a bite to eat...and less than a mile down the road was strip club after strip club...if that's any indication of the area.\n\nNext door is a Holiday Inn and honestly I would recommend getting the rates on both and just staying at the cheeper one."
"2","I usually stay at the Hilton Garden Inn on Van Buren, but they were full.  I had never stayed here before but was pleasantly surprised.  The facilities were nicely kept.  I took advantage of the Jacuzzi in the morning along with nice complimentary coffee.  \n\nI was very happy with my room.  It had dinning and sitting area and separate bed room.  I much prefer that.  Most importantly, the manager, Scott Chu, came and helped me out when I had an issue at check in.  Thank you Scott.  I will be back."
"1","This place is terrible! I live relatively close which made it my number one place to go grab little things during a project. The people working inside are very rude and are very unhelpful.\n\nI bought a shop vac that they had on special but sure enough I get it home and it breaks within 24 hours. I took it back and they wouldn't refund me the money. They only exchanged it for another one. If the first one broke why would I want a second one?\n\nThe biggest kicker of all was when I needed to rent a pump to drain my pool. The process was smooth but about a month after I used and returned the pump I had an unauthorized charge on my credit card. It was something unrelated from Ace but this was the only place that I had used my card within 6 months. I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN! I've had nothing but bad luck!"
"2","This is a very clean course not to over the top but what a location.  This area is developing so fast, the course brings increased value to the growth."
"2","One day I'll make it there for something besides breakfast, but I don't know why to bother when the breakfast is so good. They do stop breakfast at 10:30am though."
"1","The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning."
"1","If you care about animals at all, do NOT use this horrible company to go horseback riding. They do not care for their horses at all; they are never brushed, still sporting their winter coats from LAST winter. They are over worked, have saddle wounds, and have horrible mange. The owner, Rex, has a lot of horses on his ranch back in Idaho so he doesn't care how many horses he loses, he'll just bring another one over and overwork that one too. Once they are sick, or can't be ridden anymore, he ships them back to his ranch to have them be put down immediately. This place really needs to be shut down and Rex needs to be banned from owning horses for life. If you go to them, you are supporting animal abuse."
"2","Mystery Castle is the embodiment of eclectic.  The original owner built the \""castle\"" out of anything he could get his hands on, whether it was discarded bricks to empty liquor bottles.  It's really amazing to see the result of years of hard work and the knowledge that 2 years of architectural building school will achieve with just a little imagination.  Mystery Castle is the type of place you would have loved to run around and play hide and seek as a kid.  There are so many unique details that make the house itself a work of art.  Tours are held quite frequently, and you can jump in at any part of the tour and go to another one once your part of the tour is over.  Admission to tour the castle is $10.  Definitely a great place to take visitors for some quirky old school Arizona history!"
"1","I went to Baseline Dental for cleaning and the annual x-rays. The last time I went there was in summer of 2012. I have no issues with the Dr. Payne and the Hygienists, but I definitely have an issue with their communication on charges for something as simple as a filling. \n\nIn summer of 2012 I was told that I needed 2 fillings and that I would only have to pay $48 out of pocket, while my Insurance will cover the rest of it. The amount they quoted seemed reasonable (I also double-checked with a Dentist friend of mine who runs her own practice in NY). I get the work done, and a month later the real drill begins!\n\nI started getting letters from their collections department saying I owed them another $218. This is after I had already paid them $48 that they told me I owed when I got the treatment done. I paid that amount the day of my treatment and thought I was done! Magically, a month later, they realized they needed to charge me more! I called my Insurance company and was told that the Dentist is charging more than the normal amounts, and that the Insurance will only cover what's reasonable! \n\nMy issue is that a) Baseline Dental needs to charge competitive rates, charges that Insurance company won't refuse to pay, and b) If they get turned down by the Insurance company, stop harassing the patient who actually paid the amount they were asked to at the time of the treatment! \n\nOf course, I called numerous times in Fall of 2012 to get this charge off, wasted hours as I got transferred from one department to another. Baseline Dental wants to rip off their patients so bad (either thru the Insurance or directly harassing the patient), that last year they filed collection on my account for the $218. Luckily, my credit history is really good, and this hasn't impacted me much. However, I am severely disappointed at the greed a business can have, and how this greed and their practice of over-charging has turned a regular patient away! \n\nNote: I still live within a mile of this business, but refuse to go back there as a result of their unprofessional behavior. I will be going there one more time in person to sort things out, but after over a year and half of this battle, I wanted to share this with yelp and get the word out!"
"1","There were such mixed reviews that I had to find out for myself. I've been looking for a new neighborhood pizza joint and hoped that maybe this place could be it. no No NOOOO WAYYYYYY!!!\nFirst: I ordered hot wings, all drummies and extra crispy. The rep said that I couldnt have my requested order because the wings come \""pre-made\"", in \""oven-ready containers\"". When someone orders wings, they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up. Therefore, unable to take special requests.\nThe pizza arrived piping hot but I had asked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly. The cheese was melted. I have to agree with the other reviews, there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese. I'm from Wisconsin so I can taste real, quality cheese. This was very odd tasting \""cheese\"". \nThe wings were absolutely disgusting. Barely warm. I put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they still tasted rubbery. The skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy, even after my broiler attempt. Very fatty.\nOn a positive  note, the delivery was quick. I wish they would have taken the extra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy. Honestly, (and my own personal opinion because I'm no expert) I dont think the wings were even at health dept standards. \nThis was the worst $30 I've ever spent. I encourage people to do more research before settling on Gino's. I'll never order from here again."
"1","went after reading positive reviews and craving authentic mexican food. BUT this was HORRIBLE. Staples like chips and salsa were stale and bland respectively. But to make matters worse, my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever. The chicken was fried to the point that I could not chew it, and the veggies were covered in grease, and the whole thing was cooked in Soy Sauce! Is that traditional?? It was a nasty overall experience..."
"2","Love this place! The food is delicious. The salsa is fantastic and better yet, they sell it. Took home a pint and plenty of left overs. Knocking one star off because service can be extremely slow at times."
"2","Considering that finding delivery in South Phoenix is nearly impossible, this place is a gem. We stopped in to get take out because they do not have an online menu, and we were rather pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food, not to mention the great prices... Under $4 for lunch??? Seriously!.  The staff was friendly and the food was quickly prepared and hot when we drove it home.  We would order from here again in a heartbeat."
"1","If you love your pet and dont have any knowledge on how to care for them when they are ill please dont go to this place ! Go to a place that cares about animals and that is knowledgeable on treatment. They told us that our puppy had the begining stages of parvovirus and that it would be 1800 to treat him for it if we left him in their care.(Dont leave your pets with them !) I opted for a second opinion and they still charged almost 50 dollars just for walking in ! (They know what they can do with that !) The service was as if i was a second class citizen which i am by Euro standards but I'm in no way as ignorant as this staff. I got my puppy taken care of by an elderly lady at the pet store on Broadway between central and 7th. Im disgusted by people who are only out to make a quick buck at the expense of someones care for their pets ! (P.S.) They wont even mention that Tamiflu will save your puppy from parvovirus but the humane society will !"
"2","It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner."
"2","One of the most relaxing places that's within biking distance from my house. I, am indeed, one lucky gal! \n\nWhile it's not huge, the farm can keep me occupied for hours on end. I just love the serenity and beauty of it all, and taking time to breathe deeply and enjoy the little things in life. \n\nThe Maya Farm apparently has amazing CSA shares I am going to buy into shortly that include flowers. I buy myself flowers every week, so this is a super fantastic deal :)\n\nThe little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. I spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier. \n\nDownfall is the lack of good places I felt safe parking my bike. Bonus is I just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever I traveled. \n\nI will be back here... again.. and again.. it's a great weekend morning trip. I took some fantabulous photos today."
"2","A unique park-like setting, located at the back of a modest farm.  Many lovely things to look at while you wait.  The brunch is served very casually, on paper plates, which seems strange for what is essentially gourmet food, but maybe it keeps the costs down."
"2","Very nice ambience, especially in the fall. \nLarge, mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains. A quaint \""farm\"" setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings. \n\nYou park across the street in a dirt/rock lot. Once you wander across the street, there is a cute little shack type set up, you walk in, grab your fresh made, plastic packed items. They have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings, choices of sandwiches on artisan breads, delicious muffins and cake slices, all made right there. There are really cute miniature pies that look great, as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good. \n\nYou get your sandwiches (fresh made) in a little picnic basket, after you pay. Grab a seat in the fenced in garden and enjoy the views and the weather (if it's not too hot out). Many people bring their pups and enjoy a walk around the farm.\n\nI love this place, I love that everything is fresh and it always tastes great!\n\nPrices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting."
"2","Sister Sister  does amazing work.  And they are super fast at what they do.\nI recommend this place for braiding and weaves."
"1","Please, do yourself a favor and never rent from these money hungry leeches.  The office staff is horrible and will sleep with your boyfriend in your apartment while they are suppose to be at work.  They will park their blue piece of &#*! car in front of your apartment building and drive your other car as if you (the tenant) would not notice.  But other than all this happening.  The maintenance workers take their sweet time when it comes to work orders.  And this must be the best 5 star roach motel ever.  They don't care about their tenants and have no morals or integrity."
"2","I would say this park could definitely get a 5 star, but the trails I have been on here are more of a 4 star. I went to Mormon trail last weekend and it was enjoyable. My main issue was that there were more than one families that were blasting rap music from their phones on the hike....wtf? That is so inappropriate. I had to run to get away from it. The trail itself was a good hike with nice views and it was challenging and a good workout. The last time I went here I did the Kiwanis trail which I did not care for. It was more of a nature walk with no pay off....you get to the end and you meet a road then you're done. There isn't enough gain in incline to get a good view. I would definitely not hike that one again."
"1","Do not live here! I currently rent here. It's pretty cheap, compared to other places nearby, but that's for good reason. I moved in around the middle of July and have placed a maintenance request at least once every other week. The apartment is full of very out-of-date appliances that break often, and the maintenance crew is not very good at getting to requests in a timely manner. The staff is not very nice, as a whole. I mainly speak with one woman on staff, and she is wonderful. However, I went to get a package tonight from the main office, which closes at 6pm. It was 6:10 when I got there and I knocked on the locked door, just to see if someone was still around and could quickly grab the little box from the back room. A woman I'd never spoken with opened the door, and very rudely and condescendingly told me that they were closed. I told her I was only looking to pick up my package from the room right over there, and she, very rudely again, told me that they were closed and that \""you can get it tomorrow.\"" She kept repeating, as if I were a child who didn't understand English, that I could come back in the morning. \nI'd think that, considering they know that people don't like this complex, they'd at least try to be helpful."
"1","I like their food menu but the service wasn't great and their happy hour was seriously lacking selection! Nothing was very clear and our waitress seemed as though it was the worst day of her life and waiting on us was the cherry on top. My girlfriends and I won't be going back for happy hour."
"1","My family and I have been fans of this Native location for years now, but after our past couple of visits, I'm not sure if we'll be back again.\n\nLast week, the female hostess treated us \""fair,\"" but nothing too bad to complain about. During our dinner, we accidentally spilled a drink on our table, and as we tried to clean up our mess, a female worker saw what happened and walked right on by, acting as if she did not see anything. That is not customer service. We eventually flagged down a different worker, who we asked for a towel to clean the mess, she brought us a towel and we cleaned our table. Just as we finished, the party behind us spilled a drink also, so we handed them our towel as a kind gesture. Just then the same girl walked by, saw what happened to them also, and did not have the courtesy to ask what she could do. Okay, we will give Native another chance next time...\n\nToday, my mother and I went to Native for dinner. As we walked in, the hostess was blatantly unfriendly and unorganized. We told her we wanted a booth, and she said okay. We then sat down and waited for a couple of minutes until my mother noticed that newcomers were being sat down, despite the fact that we were there first. My mom then walked over and asked the female hostess if she took our party name to be seated. She replied, \""yes.\"" My mother then asked what the party name was. She replied, \""Dan.\"" My mother said no that is not our name, and the female then asked what our party name was. Who knows where the name \""Dan\"" came from. The bottom line is that they were unprofessional, and not only that, but she was very snotty and rude.\n\nMy mother worked in customer service for 18 years, and knows that any worker should take their job as serious as possible. It's a shame that businesses hire poor employees, whom ruin the experience of the business itself for customers. \n\nHope this helps, and wish you all luck on your next visit to Native. God Bless!"
"1","Still have giant sewer roaches. Upstairs neighbors, been here 5 years, say it started about 8 mths ago. Although Elna in office implied they came with us! One so big he should share the rent!AC unit dripped from ceiling during humid months. Maintance out 3x for it, told me old stuff just put a pan down. Termite tunnel on living room wall, exterminators had to be called. This place is just old and crumbling down and buggy! This was supposed to be 8 mths while we looked for a new house. Hoping that happens sooner and will happily pay to get out of my lease. $1200 to leave here is worth it!"
"1","My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \""go-to\"" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \""borderline\"" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."
"2","This is my new place for sushi in the Valley.  Went for lunch on Tuesday and the place was busy but service was very prompt.  We ordered 3 different sushi rolls and a salad.  The portions were so large we took plenty home.  The ingredients were fresh and very flavorful.  Had the eel, spicy crab, and Mexican caliente rolls and all of them were absolutely DELISH!!!  If you're a sushi lover, you will not be disappointed!"
"2","After many years of searching(with no luck), I was searching for a nice place to take my wife for a date when i came across Sakana. The site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location. I decided, being the risk taker that I am, to give it a whirl. We arrived at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked into a small strip mall. Outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door... on a tuesday.\n  Sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rush(still makes me chuckle) we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat. Once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by Ramon, not my idea of a sushi chef, but boy was i wrong. \n  Itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level Ramon was on, he was masterful, and strangely I was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversation(I am not a public people person). Ramon you are great at what you do!\n  Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)\n  Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.\n  My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.\n  All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!\n  After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!\n\nP.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)"
"1","This is no longer here. Boo.\nReally needed to go and it's as though it never existed!"
"2","Love the pancakes. Love the coffee. And they make my eggs EXACTLY how I order them. \n95% of the wait staff are prompt & efficient. The other 5%, well, I actually haven't seen them the last few times I've been here (maybe they found more suitable employment). \nMost if the menu items are very tasty and inexpensive but there are a few items I won't order. \nOverall, this is my favorite \""fast food\"" joint."
"1","The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average."
"1","OK i had to write a review because I was very disappointed!\n\nI gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery! Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be \""back in a sec\"" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!!  Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..\n\nAfter that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.\n\nOver all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.\n\n I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer!  They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!\n\nServers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable... \n\nJust dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(\n\n*Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!"
"1","What happened to this place? We have been here quite a few times and this last visit will probably be the last. We had bad service from the get go. No one sat us right away the servers were walking by looking at us but no host came. I had trouble finding anything on the menu that on a hot day in phoenix sounded good. Everything is pricey too for being so-so food. Salads are $10 and up. A trip to the bathroom grossed me out with greasy smudged hand prints all over the black stall doors. Walking back I noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food. Our little boy dropped something under our table and let's just say they can keep it because it was filthy under there. \nNo more rock bottom for us!"
"2","The breakfast burrito never disappoints and the kids love the pancakes. Nice selection of coffee and bagels keeps everyone in the family satisfied. A little pricey but the food quality is good. For Ahwatukee it's probably 5 stars but sine there are better places around Phoenix its a 4. They should expand into a bigger space as this places gets crowded in a hurry."
"1","Very disappointing! There are much better places to go for bagels and breakfast stuff.The service is lacking both in efficiency and friendliness. Actually the girl behind the counter was rude and discourteous.\nThe food was just ok nothing special\nThe best thing about eating there is I don't ever have to eat there again\nCan't imagine they'll be in business for long\nYuk :("
"2","5 Stars for what it is...Dairy Queen! Who doesn't like a Blizzard? Fast and Yummy. In and out with a Blizzard Meal Deal. I was spoon fed a Hawaiian Blizzard on the drive home...it doesn't get much better than that."
"2","Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well."
"2","Great service, friendly staff, great food and excellent atmosphere. Portions are a bit small for the price.  This will be a regular spot!!"
"2","Had a wonderful party at this place last night for a friend.  The back patio is perfect for this time of year with a nice private and relaxing feel.  The food was creative and wonderful and the wine was the perfect temp.  \n\nA musician by the name of Blaine Long was playing on the patio and the guy just blew me away.  All original music, great style and feel, and he knows how to control volume and tone so damn well.  Certainly the best musician I have heard in an Arizona bar/restaurant after living here for 15 years.  \n\nI will certainly be back to experience an evening without the party.  The staff was very good and professional.  They thought of everything the guests could need including blankets for a baby when the temps dropped."
"2","This place is perfect for a date night! Happy hour includes some yummy apps (my fave is the bruschetta) and discounted glasses of wine. There's space to sit at the bar, high top tables, as well as booths. I suggest going on the nights where there is live music to fully enjoy the experience. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about this wine bar. Go try it out!"
"1","Went in a few nights ago. Food and staff was average. The restaurant however is a mess. The tile around salsa bar is dirty and chipped,windows dirty, dusty and sign printed out and stuck on wall. The restaurant to me looks like it's been written off. It's in a hidden location. If the front end looks that bad, I would hate to see the back. Very disappointing to see a good brand let a unit get that disheveled."
"1","I had a DUI a few years ago and based on this law office's great \""client testimonials\"" they could get out of my situation.  8 months later and $5,000.00 lighter in the pocket i was being told by my attorney \""Here, sign this. Your getting 10 days in tent city, paying $4,800 in fines, getting the ignition interlock, and have to take DUI classes.\""\n\nThis law office didn't do anything for me despite having 100% positive reviews on their website.  \n\nWell, i guess its true, never trust an attorney...."
"1","If I have to review the food alone, I will give it a one star.  The service is prompt and courteous so I'll give it an extra one star.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.  We had a reservation and was seated promptly.  The waiter came and greeted us, gave us the menu and everything went well.\n\nAppetizer: We started with the Alp & Dell Cheese Fondue which is a white wine and Gruyere, Raclette and Fontina Cheese Fondue. It tasted two dimensional, exactly garlicky and salty.  The raw cauliflower and carrot which I usually love to eat tasted bitter with the cheese.\n\nSalad: We went with California Salad which is mixed salad greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  The salad came very watery, very very sweet and it was swimming in the dressing. We could not even finish it off.\n\nMain Course: This is the worse of all the courses. We picked the pacific rim cooked in coq au vin broth.  It came with Teriyaki Marinated Sirloin, Citrus Pork Tenderloin, Shrimp, Chicken, Pot sticker, Mushroom, and Veggies.  We deliberately chose coq au vin broth even though it cost more because we read here that it's worth it. Everything tasted bland and that citrus pork and teriyaki sirloin tasted very weird, sour and salty and not in a good way at all.  The chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland.  It really tasted like boiled chicken meat that's a bit salty. Their solution?  Dip it in our sauce: Teriyaki, Sweet and Sour and Yogurt based curry sauce.  The sauces tasted like cheap sauces you can find in a bottle in any grocery stores. It has no character, no complexities,  very very disappointing.  Oh yeah, this is what our waitress said,  just cook everything about 2 minutes or so, don't worry if you don't time it correctly, it's impossible to overcook anything here, just leave it on the pot and that's fine.  This is not just the cooking instruction for  our table.  We can hear that every table get the same cooking instructions from different waiter/waitress.  The problem is not overcooking for us, but it just tasted bland.\n\nDessert: We chose the Smore with Dark Chocolate Fondue.  This is the best part out of this horrible feast.  It comes with Strawberry, Graham Cracker, Marshmallow, Cheesecake, Pound Cake and Rice Crispies to dip it with. First, the strawberry was fresh, marshmallow was great, graham cracker was crunchy.  Now come the bad part, the part that they had to make: The rice crispies was kinda stale, the pound cake was crumbling like a week old cake, and the cheesecake was just meh.  We suddenly realized that the part that was good, they did not have to make( ie: the strawberry, the cracker and the marshmallow).  The part that they had to make tasted bad( ie: the crispies, cheesecake, pound cake).  \n\nWe do not mind splurging on our foods on special occasion.  We realize that it takes a lot of efforts to make special dishes.  This is seriously lacking in everything, cheap basic material for the food, horrible taste, and no cooking method involve at all by the kitchen.  Why are we paying that much again?  I don't mind paying $100 for a meal if it is cooked properly and tastes great.  It's not the price at all, it's just there is no value to this meal."
"2","Loved this date, the food was pretty much what I anticipated as a fondue fan. I was floored however by their extensive dessert menu, where the flaming turtle using dark chocolate was the highlight of the meal. It will be in the potential date night rotation in the future."
"2","With some trepidation after reading other reviews from people who used coupons, we went for dinner to Ahwatukee Melting Pot. We have been there before and were always happy with meal but wondered how coupon would change it all based on other reviews.  This time two of us were on coupon and the third decided to get 4 course.  He says \""what a great meal for $36!\""   Jennifer was our very entertaining server. She was quick on the \""merlot\"" refill. Wink wink (she will know what we mean). Quick service and very fast on bringing generous refills of shrimp and tenderloin which we consumed the fastest.  All in all a great meal and loved the dessert!!  Jennifer earned her 20% gratuity."
"1","Our very presence in their lobby was an inconvenience to them. The manager was extremely rude when we asked for a table w out a reservation. No offer to wait just a blunt 45 min wait along with a snarky comment as we left \""do not take any more people with out a reservation\"". Thanks for the rude interaction were headed to Cheesecake Factory."
"2","I had a shrimp, artichoch pasta dish that was very good."
"2","Good food and good service. Indoor was a bit dark"
"1","Usually good but today was terrible. Ordered eggs basted soft. Got scrambled. Sent back and they came back cold, basted with oil and burnt around the edges. Toast was pretty much NOT toasted. Manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill. They adjusted the check though, so that was nice."
"2","Go for lunch. \n\nMy folks live here, I live at Arribas. This place is delcious. Two item lunch combo and a tall drink makes for a great day with family and friends. Take your parents here, take a date here food is always cooked excellently, always busy, friendly, and great. \n\nNever have had issues eating here. Sometimes take out would mess up which you just have to make sure when you go for pick up to double check, they are busy. \n\nAll and all the food is always good, I like the shredded beef tacos, the chicken chimichangas, Flautas, Dos XX or dare I say Margaritas in small punch bowels that will make you happy. \n\nIf you haven't tried swing by, if you have visit sometime."
"1","The service, chips and salsa were fine then it all went South.  I had the La Bandera (3 enchiladas) and all of them were tasteless and the meat was tough.  I went because I had a gift card.  As much as I love free meals I would gladly have paid double for good food."
"2","Had a great experience at this place. I went during lunch, had the chicken fajitas, and loved them. I definitely recommend this place at lunchtime, as it isn't too crowded and the prices are better. Also, our waitress was amazing! She waited on several tables and even heated up the tortillas. She also gave my family water to-go when she heard we were on a roadtrip. Loved it!"
"1","Delicious food. Horrible service at this location. Go to the Southern and McClintock location for better service and friendlier staff."
"2","My daughter really wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes.  After some prodding, I told her we could go, but I wanted to find out what was behind this instance that we have Sweet Tomatoes for lunch.  What did she hold to be the very essence of Sweet Tomatoes that was driving her to say that we must go?  Here is my interview.\n\nInterview with my daughter.\n\nMe: What  do you like about Sweet Tomatoes?\n\nMira: The dessert and the pizza.\n\nMe: What else do you like?\n\nMira: The food.\n\nMe: But, why do you like coming HERE?\n\nMira: Because .  . . Of . . . the FOOD!\n\nMe: Is there anything else you like besides the food?\n\nMira: The drinks."
"2","Probably the best salad bar restaurant I have been to.  They have a great selection of items and everything is fresh. They have a few prepared salads if you are not in the mood to build or just want to use it as a starting point.  My favorite section though is the soup bar.  They always have a great selection to choose from, no matter your mood.  My favorites are the chili and of course the Sweet Tomato soup.  \nThe staff is usually friendly and not a nuisance like they can be at some buffets.  There is always someone circling the floor with a basket of cookies.  Definitely a favorite of ours when we lived in Phoenix.  I wish they were in PA and MD so we could visit again.\nIf you are looking for a quick healthy meal (with the not so healthy always available) look no farther."
"2","GOOD SALAD BAR\nConsistently, good food. The soup, salad and  desserts are good.\nGREAT value for families with small children under 2 eat free. Ice Cream Machine with the toppings and really good home made biscuits and honey butter."
"1","Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money; they are very aggressive about making future appointments and overcharging when they can.  I would not recommend anyone to this place."
"2","the bomb! and cheap!"
"2","Tried them again with the kids last night and have a few new things to say since my last visit.\n\nI had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla \""wet\"" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.\n\nThe carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.\n\nThe chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.\n\nA word about the \""salad\"" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.\n\nThe beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.\n\nThe staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding...."
"2","Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat."
"2","Wow what a hidden gem this place is!!! Stopped in with my mom and sister. I ordered a bean tostada, pastor street taco and some chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back."
"1","Would not recommend.  Food was good but I feel the refried beans were cooked from a pot of boiled beans that had burnt.  I like *ahumado* flavor but geez.  Bummer the tacos seemed good but i could not get over the flavor of the beans. Disappointed they would serve that"
"1","Food is decent but service makes this place a risk.  They often lose orders or screw up the orders.  So, calling ahead to save time often turns into waiting for them to fix or create the order you gave them 20 minutes prior. You'd think a neighborhood restaurant would care enough to get an order right.  Quality also varies greatly for order to order. Try Burrito Company instead."
"1","Overpriced and uneven haircuts given. Don't waste your money here! It costs more to get a tiny dog groomed than a regular woman's haircut. $55 for a 3 pound dog !! They are crazy..."
"1","From a veg point of view this place was a total flop. The online menu shows a fish sandwich, however in store the menu item was missing.\n\nUnlike you usually Greek esque place, there is no falafel. I resorted to hummus $2.95 and for that price it does not include any pita, so I was forced to order a peta for $.90\n\nThe hummus came in a small Styrofoam cup not worth the $3 and the pita was soft and warm but again worth nearly a $1 I think not.\n\nMost of the menu is beef gyros, gyro meat plats or gyro sandwiches.\n\nThere are a few salads on the menu but I am not a salad person.\n\nI think I miss the pizza hut that used to occupy this location"
"2","Great service, manager honored coupon I forgot; great ppl."
"1","I literally just walked out of this store and was so disappointed. My husband and I just spent 15-20 minutes looking for fun things to buy our dog as its her birthday (yes, we are those kinds of parents). The old man at the register said not a single word to either of us. We were not greeted or even asked of we needed help with anything. He didn't even look up from his computer. We would have made several purchases but decided not to give this establishment any of our money. We will not ever return."
"1","Horrible customer service at this location, out of stock on a lot of items that are on sale.I will spend my money somewhere else."
"1","Not so clean, both the facility and the workers.  This place has been here forever and they do make a good toasted sub.  They should, they were doing it long before toasting was an option at most chain sub shops.\n\nIf you can get past the cleanliness, the food is not bad...although I do wonder about the hygiene practices in the back where they make the subs."
"1","Terrible haircut. She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. Now I have to go back to get it fixed. I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again."
"1","Cacuts Jacks was closed for a while, but it is up and running once again.  Total dive bar in Ahwatukee, it is never my first choice, however a few of my friends love to go there for the cheap drinks and music (live or juke box).  I have never tried any thing to eat at Cactus Jacks, and I don't plan on it anytime soon.\n\nCacuts Jacks isn't really the kind of bar to start out the night, however we have been known to finish our night there, usually when Happy Hour at Brad's Places goes a little long, or when we're headed back to the tuke from some other event and don't want to stop the drinking fun!\n\nWhen we do end up going there, or even suggesting \""How about Cactus Jacks?\"", the rest of the group knows that the night just went from a rank of mild intoxication, to \""might as well call a cab now!\""  Crazy things have happened at Cactus Jacks, lots of good stories and foggy memories."
"1","This place is too pricey for the quality and size of their food.  I ordered linguine with white wine clam sauce and I'm pretty sure they used canned clams.  I would much rather eat at Va Bene which is probably a 10 min drive from this restaurant. The quality of food is a lot better and fresher.  Also the waiter here wasn't too competent and service is incredibly slow for a non-busy night."
"1","The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me? It was like a \""fun size\"" but I was looking for the king size cheesecake. Other than that I don't think I'll be back."
"1","This is one of those rare times that I'm not in line with popular Yelp opinion. Guys, I'm not sure what the heck I'm missing here.  I've tried two Pizzas here: the BBQ Chicken and the Vegetarian. Both pizzas were beautifully presented but they were equally bland as pretty. I must admit the Old World Salad is good but I don't think I'll come back for just the salad \""shrugs\"". I like the location and the dining room is nice but it' LOUD in here.  I'm just not sure what the hype is about, I think I'll pass on the flavorless pretty pizza."
"1","The food was just OK. The miso super super spicy, like noserunning spicy. \n\nService wasn't great. The table slightly smelled like a dirty cleaning cloth.\n\nAnd the WORST of all they had a DJ with super loud music. AYFKM? Who wants a DJ in a sushi bar/restaurant? It was just annoying."
"1","Went to dinner tonight and got horrible service, nothing worse than serving you a semi-warm overpriced beer in a warm glass. Food was ok way overpriced."
"2","Ra is a tradition for us. When I get to \""go home\"" to the valley there always seems to be a girls' night out. Great service and great food, all the time. Try their coconut creme brulee if you're in the mood for something sweet. You won't be disappointed! Prices are best at happy hour- of course."
"2","Best RA location in AZ. Always get great service and great sushi consistently. I can't say that for the Scottsdale locations. Also can't beat the happy hour deals and the specials when you join their loyalty club. One more perk - they are the only place you can find Orion for your sake bomber instead of Kirin, etc."
"1","I keep hearing good things about Neo Tokyo and have driven by it way to many times. I went for lunch the restaurant was empty well waiting for my food I saw everyone was getting take out. The staff was really friendly the restaurant really clean... I ordered the lunch combo #1 Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice I also ordered the 3pcs Shrimp Tempura. The Chicken was pretty good for the price without the hot chili sauce it would have been a D- The shrimp Tempura was not crispy on the outside it was soggy that makes it a D- as well. I will not be going back for lunch anytime soon."
"1","People who work there are full of attitude.\n\nFood is tasteless\n\nIce tea has no flavor\n\nNo point to the place"
"2","Sometimes months will go by and I forget about Rubios. Then I'll have it and I'm reminded how good it is!\n\nThe salsa bar rocks. Chips are free with every meal. Prices are reasonable. Oh, and they have some healthy options as well (the HealthMex tacos/burritos are really yummy!).\n\nMy husband LOVES their fish tacos--the original AND the grilled versions as well."
"1","I'm giving it two stars for the customer service, the staff was super friendly.  There's a fast food Mexican restaurant (with drive thru) I can get better & cheaper fish tacos from. The taco was dry and I didn't care for the red sauce on it (I guess it was salsa?) I'm surprised by all the positive reviews."
"2","So I started this weight lost journey last year, I lost 58 pounds and am still on the losing streak (this losing streak I can handle) now at the apt complex I live in, it had a gym that has been very useful for me, up till 2 weeks ago when they shut it down. Plus to be honest because it was so close to my place I didn't go regularly, I got lazy.  So that was my push to get a gym membership, I looked around and Gold's gym seem to me the best bang for your buck!  I am happy with my choice! Had my 1st work out their yesterday, it was just cardo, but I did get to check out the gym and look forward to making this my new gym! And with my membership I get a lesson with a personal trainer, got my appt all set up for Friday. Look forward to continuing my losing streak and working out!"
"1","knowledge of the people in this store is hit or miss...\n\nI stopped in because my pool motor is making a racket.  I had a picture of the label, showed them it's a 3/4 hp motor.  it either needs a rebuild or replacement\n\nthey don't do rebuilds, so I ask for a price on a replacement.  the guy brings out a 2 hp motor... and quotes me something like $450.   he was pretty clueless, asking me what type of motor I wanted.  umm... I showed you what I've got, why wouldn't you be able to tell me what I need to replace it?  I sure don't need a 2hp motor to replace a 3/4 hp.\n\nI know two-speed motors can be used in place of my single-speed and they're more efficient, so I ask him about that.  He has to call a guy at another store to figure out what I need and how much it is.\n\nlike I said, hit or miss..."
"2","Windy City DJs was wonderful.  Frank and Susan in the office did a wonderful job of sending us all the paperwork and contracts, and setting up a time to meet with us to discuss services prior to deciding on using their company.  Lee, our DJ, was incredibly organized and professional.  He called me the week of our wedding to discuss all playlists, ceremony music and timing, and the nature of what we were looking for at our reception.  The wireless mic we ordered was flawless, and the sound quality and lighting provided were perfect for our venue and guests.  The guests enjoyed the music and Lee kept in constant communication with me as well as our caterer and photographer.  We would whole-heartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a wedding DJ, or a DJ for any other event."
"1","This place is NOT a 4 star hotel as they try to state they are.  We paid $300 a night expecting to have a nice experience at what is supposed to be a guest only water park. The park was just like any other public water park. There was absolutely no place to sit and the chairs if you could find one were cheap with cheap towels.  We never even made it to our room as we checked out as soon as we experienced the pool.  BTW we found out that they constantly run special pricing cutting room rates to about 100 a night.  This is why the water park is packed and for those of us that expect to receive  4star $300 a night hotel service will be out of luck at this hotel. Might be worth it if you get one of their cheap deals."
"1","I am actually writing this review from my room at the hotel now.\n\nVery disapointed in this place.  My wife and I have been here for a week and even with the deal I got on our room I feel like I've overpaid.  In fact the only good thing about this place so far is that it was cheap.\n\n- Rooms are old and dirty.  I was told that some of the rooms have been renovated and are nice but not the room that we were given thats for sure.  Stains all over the carpets, bird droppings all over the balcony and balcony furniture.  Pretty gross.  Not to mention both the TVs were small, old and unwatchable which was actually a problem seeing how none of the pools were worth going to but more on those later.\n\n- Maid service was horrible and non-existant.  We have been for 5 days and have maid service only three times.  On the second time we happened to come back to our room while the maid was still there, she locked herself in our room and had both TVs on a spanish soap opera and was visibly annoyed that we wanted in to our room.  She didn't even \""clean\"" the room and simply changed out the towels and made the bed.  Bags for ice (the ice bucket was too dirty to use without one) were never replenished, garbage on top of the mini-bar was never removed and room service trays were not being picked up.  Our breakfast trays sit outside in the hot Arizona sun until the next morning when our new breakfast is delivered.  The plus side of this is that we had an entertaining bird fight outside our room last night.\n\n- Pools.  So they charge a 30$/day resort fee.  The theory here is that the 30/day gives us full access to the water park, pools, gym etc. which is a great idea although the water park is closed during the week, the gym is ok but the other pools... DISGUSTING.  More bird droppings everywhere and garbage in the water.  There is a pool that advertises a swim up bar.. sure there is something that looks like a bar.. but no alcohol or even an attendant to serve you.  Some of the pools have a phone you can use to order from a limited menu but they can't even get basic orders right.\n\n- Room Service.  Very limited menu and as with most places overpriced.  This plus they seem to not understand basic instructions like \""do not toast my sandwhich please\"".  My wife -- after THREE times asking for it to be made right finally gave up and just ate it as it was.\n\nThis place does have potential but apparently they are understaffed and those that do work here do not seem to care and it really needs updating and cleaning.\n\nWould not stay here again."
"1","Sprawling tired resort with $30 a day resort fee and lots of tipping opportunities. The resort fee was supposed to be waived for those attending the event, and was with restrictions like we couldn't use the fitness center. Only stayed here because the conference was here. We told the front desk that we were there for the conference, and wanted to be with the other Realtors, and instead they put us in a Mountainside Villa that was a hike to get to the event."
"1","NOTE: Our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a Livingsocial.com deal was made available.  We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\"" child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it."
"2","Pretty awesome place. Great pools and kid friendly."
"2","My daughter's high school basketball team comes to the Arizona Grand Resort twice every year for the Nike Tournament of Champions.  It is a beautiful place, centrally located, with lots of amenities at the resort and nearby. This year we had a problem with the wi-fi access in the Mountainside rooms, but the manager made it right by us.  Our team enjoyed themselves, and it is a good value, so we'll keep coming back to this resort."
"1","This resort is in need of serious renovations! The king bed sagged in the middle and was very uncomfortable. The pullout sofa literally had springs popping through the thin mattress. The pools were well over 100* and not refreshing at all. The last night we were there the fire alarm went off at 12:30am for over a half hour with loud pitch sirens to find out someone had pulled the alarm. Nothing about this resort was worth the money. The kids were quickly bored of the slides and all complained it pinched their skin and hurt their butts like a bruised feeling. We will not be back... Ever."
"1","We stayed here for 5 days to visit with our granddaughters from Bay Area CA.  Upon arriving we soon realized that our room had no internet.  I was on the phone with the front desk along with the internet provider for over an hour to no avail.  The next morning they had us move to room C235 (which was a complete inconvenience since we had already unpacked everything!!!).  This room, while directly next to the pool, still had very spotty WIFI and I was constantly getting booted from the internet both on my iphone and my ipad.\n\nWhile the pool was nice and the grandchildren enjoyed the Oasis Water Park ($40 per wrist band for extra guests) there was no microwave in the hotel room and the mini fridge (if you can call it that) was so small that nothing fit, and the few things we did put in it (which were leftovers from the Rustlers Roost) along with our beverages were warm in the morning!!!  \n\nBottom line......this place might offer you a deal on the room rate, but be very prepared to spend a crapload of money at the \""Lobby Bar & Grill\"", \""Rustlers Roost\"" or \""Aunt Chiladas\""!!!  They make sure you can't store or prepare food in your room.  I've stayed at some pretty shady motels in my life and they have ALL had a mini fridge with a mini freezer and for the most part a microwave!!!  We were very disappointed in this hotel and will NEVER EVER AGAIN STAY HERE!!\n\nOh and don't forget the $40/day resort fee on top of your room rate.....then ad $5/day tax to that!! Really??\n\nOh and if you order a movie for the kids it's only good for ONE WATCH, not 24 hours like everywhere else.  Seriously this place is a RIPOFF!!  Do yourself and your family a financial favor and stay in Mesa, then get tickets to Sunsplash for $20/day and put the rest of your money in your back pocket or grab a pizza at 1/4 the cost of that money grabber AZ Grand Resort!  I know I will next time.\n\nTobin"
"2","We recently stayed at the resort for a large dance competition.  the hotel was terrific; staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Our room was clean and well stocked with a beautiful view.  The water park was well enjoyed by the literally hundreds of dancing kids.  There were many lifeguards and the pools were incredibly clean and well tended.  Service at restaurant was very slow, but the food was good."
"2","I arrived with my three year old asleep in her car seat.  She was probably out for the night.  I promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cave.  A few more turns and we entered the restaurant on the second floor.  At this point, we were given the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.  I parted ways with my daughter at this point.  I didn't need The DVD player to entertain her this meal, the slide entertained her till the food arrived.  She came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision, and then went back to sliding.  With some older kids present, letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious, but sipping my water in silence left me unconcerned.  I ordered a kids meal, grilled cheese, for her and I had meat.  My daughter ate her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.  For my part, meat is good.  Clearly a tourist stop, as reflected in the price and by the d\u00e9cor, I've been waiting for some non-vegetarian relative to visit so that I can return."
"1","Very marginal food, service, and atmosphere.  there is a live bill out front, and it really makes the whole area smell like cow flops. Disneyland atmosphere."
"2","We were here last Saturday and had a really good time. The steaks were delicious and the service was good. Hubby had the swordfish and was over the moon about it (it was his first time having it)\nMy only complaint was that the music was REALLY loud for a restaurant but hey, we were entertained. \nWe had a great evening and look forward to returning next time we are craving steak!"
"2","Went here for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding. The food was great, the service was great, the drinks were great. \n\nWe ate outside and the view was spectacular. \n\nI'm a little bummed I missed out on the infamous slide, but next time for sure. \n\nMy biggest issue was parking. Even on a Thursday night we had drive around for quite a while to find a spot. It was tough because our car contained a toddler, and a 7 months pregnant woman and we has to hoof it pretty far. Maybe a shuttle service from lower level parking would help."
"1","they make smaller tables wait longer to be sat and the food is not that great you can get better food at mid level steakhouse"
"1","Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said \""Oh, it will be out in a few minutes\"". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people. \n\nThe food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.\n\nWe will definitely never be eating here again."
"1","I ordered the Big Burger and was sorely disappointed. The burger patty was over cooked, soaked in grease, and tasteless. The fries were nothing special nor were the onion rings. The atmosphere was loud as to be expected, the waitstaff was pleasent enough; however, most barley spoke english. At least the free cotton candy was good....that's about it. Super disappointed and I will not be returning anytime soon. This place needs to focus less on the decor and atmosphere and more on the food."
"1","Be careful of this place. We made a reservation and showed up only to be told that they don't make reservations for parties of our size and that we would have to wait. I even called the morning before to confirm the reservation. Because of this one I our party had to leave before we ate. \n\nThis is completely unacceptable and we will never be back!"
"1","Well, food was bad. My shrimp was TASTELESS....I mean....no seasoning AT ALL. Bland rice. Others at the table said the same thing about their food. Amazing waiter though. For a crazy Friday night with kids everywhere...he was amazing and attentive. Wish I remembered his name. Very tall guy. LOL. This place is geared more for children for sure. A big slide, a balloon guy comes to the tables ect. An adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome. But I would say this place is more for kids than an adult night. That's just my opinion."
"2","Toni has been a god send with a very reactive dog that I had.  We worked hard, did the training and the investment of time, but Toni was the one that was able to talk me through my options.  She is invested in her commitment to what she does and is amazing in how she works with these dogs.  I have referred several other people to her that have been very happy."
"1","HORRIBLE DRY CLEANER. DO NOT USE. \n\nDropped off around 20 items for dry cleaning, and at least 4 came back totally ruined. Buttons were broken, ink stains were on several items (like from a ballpoint pen) that had not been present when I dropped off the clothing. \n\nStains I had mentioned and asked them to try to remove were still present, and they didn't make any notice of this or let me know that they were unable to remove said stains. Several stains looked untouched, like they hadn't even made an attempt to remove them. A few silk items I dropped off came back feeling like a strange texture, like they were very stiff. When I complained, no explanation was offered and the best they could do was take the items with ink for a free redo. They were practically already ruined, so I let them try. Around 300 dollars of clothing was ruined by this dry cleaner. Awful, awful service."
"2","I've never had a bad experience with this location! Of course it's not the best pizza in the world, but it deserves to be measured against its own potential.\n\nThe online ordering process is really painless--don't bother calling. I was hesitant to do it at first, but they really have their system down. You can even watch a little progress meter that tells you when they are making your order, when they are checking it, and when they leave the store with it if you requested delivery. There are always coupons available online as well.\n\nThe orders we've placed have always been correct. We don't just order pizza--at times we've ordered wings, sandwiches, soda, and even specialty items like gluten-free crust pizza. They nail it every time."
"2","It seems the staff here have made a huge improvements recently.  They smile and are polite. Perhaps they let some of the staff go. If so, that was wise. A few months ago, everytime I came in there was incompetence or lack of care. On one occasion,  a lady seemed to be babysitting her granddaughter while working and laughed about her neglectful, wasteful service mistakes."
"2","I am really impressed by this facility. Every machine you could want, Racquetball courts, The best spin bikes anywhere, large arobics room, free weights, TV's on the cardio some with ipod hookups, pool, spa and a steam room.\n\nSure the staff may be incompetent, and the sales people are probably very shady, but luckily I was grandfathered in from PureFiness and rarely deal with either. \n\nOne of the biggest negatives for me is the parking lot. There are more speed bumps in the parking lot  per 100 feet than you will see in your whole day. I do not know why they felt it necessary to put so many of them. I can not drive my convertible here due to them.\n\nI also am unsure about the aroma of the free weight area in back, To me it smells like a barn, but I think it is due to the glue used on the floor. Either way I do hope it dissipates soon.\n\nThe machines are nice they usually have two to three of each type of machine with the latest being the eclipse line that are very smooth and easily adjustable.\n\nThe spin bikes are great, very smooth, digital read outs and so far 100% functional.\n\nA small grip with the TV's on the cardio equipment is the channel selection. News stations sports, E and some anti acne channel. I would be happier with the local mix of channels.\n\nThe pool area is nice with a three lane lap pool, sizable spa, and steam room. They are cleaned nightly but there are some grimy spots that could use a bit more attention."
"1","Waffle House . . . food is good - consistant and good.\n\nCook was awesome, she was able to put a quality product out to her best.  Kudos to ' Alice ' ;)\n\nService was weak . . . shameful.  Only one server and he was overwhelmed.  Ok - Friday evening ( 8 pm ish ) and I can understand trying to cut corners on expenses by letting a server go but NEVER cut corners where it counts.  Service is one area that will break a restaurant or more important bring people back.  ( food of course is the other ) \n\nOne server was unable to get the orders correct, product out to the customers nor clean up.  Given that the cook was doing her job . . . the person taking / putting in and delivery of said orders was the weak link here.  He was overwhelmed with having the entire floor to himself.\n\nI will not go back to this Waffle House again.\n\nSorry, the management is to blame and since they don't care, why should I return."
"2","Waffle House has never let me down and this location didn't either. It was roomier than others I have been to, so that was a plus. Our server was very attentive and so were the other servers there. I really felt the servers provided exceptional customer service, constantly coming by to ask if we needed anything else. The food was delicious as usual. First time we had ordered sausage there, they use the sausage patties. The waffles were phenomenal! They are a must to order, even if you've never been much of a waffle person before. They can't go wrong with baking in the \""toppings\"". Can't wait to go back!"
"1","Quite the adventure.  I had bought a Living Social and Gavin did my hair.  It came out fine (cut, color, and blow out) and since then I have been back three times.  The last time I went, I had an appointment and when I walked in, Gavin was working on someone else.  I waited twenty five minutes before it was my time to get my hair cut and colored.  Not even a sorry I am running late.  Two weeks ago I booked with Gavin for 9:00.  The day before my appointment I got a voicemail asking if I could come at 11:30.  When I called back I said I would change my appointment for then.  I was then asked if I could make it at 12:00.  I said yes.  Got there today and Gavin was NOT there.  First I was told he was out getting supplies, and then after 15 minutes I told Frank, the owner, that I was not going to wait anymore and leave.  He then told me that Gavin was on his way and had gone for therapy.  So which is it?  Supply store or therapy.  In any case, as I was walking out, Gavin showed up 20 minutes late.  I usually don't write bad reviews but I just wanted to warn others as this has got to be the most exasperated I have ever been at a hairdresser."
"2","Seafood lunch red curry plate.  Awesome. Tiny little place but clean and comfortable atmosphere.  As soon as I walked in I smelled good food!  They have free wifi and waitress was really nice!"
"1","The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you."
"2","I have had this place in the past. Never disappointed. Sweet chili wings are very good. The customer service was also great."
"2","My puppy chewed my glass frames and the staff were able to fix them for me in minutes.  It was a welcome surprise.  I highly recommend."
"1","They had 2 people working the lunch rush, no brainer they need at least one more.  I eat at capriottis all the time and it was my first trip to this location.   I was severely underwhelmed and my sandwich was ok at best."
"1","Stay as far away from this salon as possible! I live so close that I've stopped by when desperate even though experience says I should know better.\n\nHere are the main issues:\n\n1. Quality is hit or miss and the hits are as bad as they get! While it's true you may get a decent stylist, the bad ones are so bad they should have their licenses revoked. I got a haircut there once. It was so uneven that people I didn't even know were commenting on it. When I mentioned it to the manager, she said that the girl was new and still \""working out the kinks\"" - there was no offer of reparation or a coupon for the next visit. \n2. Turnover and unhappy staff: it's impossible to find a good stylist that will stick around very long. I've witnessed full force arguments between members of the staff that were loud enough for everyone in the store to hear. \n3. No customer service: if you complain about anything to the staff or manager, you may get an apology but forget about anything else in the way of amends.\n\nWhile I realize that you can't expect miracles from a low end salon that only charges $15 per haircut (no blow dry for that amount) it's still reasonable to expect competent professionals, right?"
"1","DO NOT GO!  I took my Pomeranian there to be groomed.  They were given very SPECIFIC instruction's on how I wanted her groomed, including length of the body, and to just trim the face, leaving her with some fluff and fullness around the face as a Pom should be.  When I picked her up, the groomer had completely shaved her entire body, including around her face.  When I asked why she looked this way the answer the groomer gave me was \""I groom pom's like fox's.\""  This was a blatant disregard for what I (the customer) had specifically asked for.  When I spoke to the manager and told her I was completely unsatisfied with how she looked and that my instructions were completely disregarded her answer was \""do you want me to fix it?\""  Fix it?!  What is there to fix?  There is no hair left!  So I said \""no I don't want you to cut anymore off\"" (she would look completely bald).  Then she said \""well what do you want me to do?\""  I said \""well I'm an unsatisfied customer, what do you do when that happens?\""  She said she would give me a discount on my next grooming.  I said \""I paid for this grooming, which was atrocious, not my dogs next grooming.\""  Then she says \""well it sounds like you just want to complain and not let me fix it.\""  I said \""what is there to fix?  Again, she has NO hair left!\""  So then she says \""well do you want a refund?  Would that make you happy?\""  I said yes that would make me very happy.  Her reply \""well I just can't do that.\""  Ok, so then why was that offered to me?  So, aside from the horrible grooming and terrible customer service, the place is also very dirty and it's more than obvious that the groomers are not well trained in how to groom certain breeds of dogs, as well as the fact that they completely disregard any grooming instructions you give them."
"1","My Wife and I have been going to Arrivederci for the last couple of years. The food is typically fantastic, unfortunately I can't say the same for the service. The service there is hit or miss at best! The reviews that have been posted over the last two years commenting on the service are pretty much spot on, and apparently dismissed by the management. The waiters are not attentive, not accurate in their ability to get the order right and generally absent. I have decided we will not be returning to this establishment any time soon, if at all.  It truly is a shame because the food and atmosphere are great but the service is horrible, with what you pay there should be some level of service.\n\nFood is good service is very poor."
"1","Be careful using a credit card here.  Michael the bartender charged our credit card incorreclty TWICE!  I had to file a dispute with my bank.  If I go back, I will only pay cash!  It's too bad, with money tight these days, you have to watch very closely."
"2","A great Asian buffet. They have a sushi chef in the middle ready to make any kind of sushi roll on the spot. They even offer brown rice options too. (Although my brown rice california rolls were a little harder than I would like)\n\nThey have your typical Chinese food options like Orange chicken, crab puffs, string beans, lo-mein etc... There's a hibachi corner as well where you can make your own plates of stir-fry. \n\nThe dessert here is much better than Pacific buffet in Chandler. They have a chocolate mousse cake that was really yummy. I don't think they're homemade but still didn't taste old like other buffet places I've been to. \n\nThere's a bar as well but I didn't order any alcoholic beverages. \n\nMy husband loved the crab legs which are always a customer favorite so you have to keep an eye out for them.\n\nI would say they refresh the buffet items fairly quickly. I checked in on Yelp and even got a $5off discount!\n\nAverage dinner price is $16-$17."
"1","Nothing gourmet here, greasy fried food. Barely any crab legs.I didn't eat much and I kept throwing good away cause it was nasty. Save your money and go elsewhere.\n\nNot going there again"
"1","The employees at this location always seem to have a latte up their a**. The few times that I have been here, I have felt that I'm bothering the employees and interrupting their conversations."
"2","Very good prices, decent pizza and Italian.  Would try again."
"2","I love Italian. Nothing like homemade Italian food. The owner came out and introduced him self made me feel at home and important. He gave me a glass of Sangria wine which i think is like their signature drink. Pizza is unlike anything else around. It is OK to bring your kids into this restaurant. many families here. I love it. Thanks Mario and family."
"1","Saw Dr. Hetrick..I went to this office for Chronic headaches and neck pains. I felt like they did not care about my health condition and now I have Migraines. I told them I take medication that helps me a bit to get through the day but gets worse to the point where i'm out of it.What's their fix, a bag full of more medications (watch out liver) feels like they thought I was faking or something. Worst place to go really unhappy that I wasted my money and time"
"2","Always good and dependable food and service"
"1","First of all, we only ate here because our hotel was down the street.  Our relatives wanted to go to a different place.  I really don't care about slow food as some have complained about this store.  I do care about food making me sick.  I've been to other Cracker Barrels and I have never had food poisoning.  Two people in our party became ill after eating here on Monday.   Worst of all when I called the store to tell them,  they put me on hold for 10 minutes until I finally gave up and hung up.  I wanted to let you know we think the ham made two of us sick and you get the worst rating possible for this."
"1","Interesting  Closure--- I thought I was the only one who had had bad experiences at Malees!!  We had a terrible time a year or so ago. Rude  unhelpful servers, \nI contacted the management , they apologized , said they were sending a \ncertificate to show their concern. Never saw it.  \nI love the sushi but not enough to pay for awful wait staff.  I wonder if the economy  or the service closed them  down.My husband and I used to go here frequently before  the problems."
"2","Love this place. Great service and always fast. Not super busy for the times I've been here and always quiet which is good. I've tried a bunch of their pizzas and they're always amazing! Their salads are good too. Wish they had a bigger desert choice though. The Chipotle Chicken Pizza is a little too spicy but it was very good. I'd definitely go here again and recommend it to people in town for a visit since it has very simple but a expansive choice of foods."
"2","Good food, good salsa choices.  The fish taco's were really good.  Just wish they could have come baked, broiled or grilled in place offried.  Still, very yummy."
"1","I had some time to kill and stopped in here on an impulse to try a gel manicure. I've done gel manicures myself at home and love how they last at least two weeks. Since I was treating myself and having them done, I figured I'd go for the french manicure since I'm not that coordinated to do that for myself. \n\nI was the only customer in there, until a woman stopped in to have a nail repaired. Having nothing else to do, the rest of the staff sat around and talked and listened to their ipods and played with their phones. The place wasn't very clean and a fine layer of nail dust seemed to coat everything at my nail techs station. \n\nShe shaped my nails kind of square-ish, which is not really my preference, but they look pretty good. You have to \""cure\"" the polish under the UV light for each layer in order to set it. This just takes a minute or two but my nail tech proceeded to use her phone during this time. I find this annoying.  I paid $35 plus tip for the french gel manicure, and they charge $30 for a regular gel manicure. \n\nMy disappointment as I look at my nails one day later, is that there is a chip already. Gel nails aren't supposed to chip and they are supposed to last at least two weeks and just sort of grow out as your nails grow. So what's the deal? I guess I'm better off doing them by myself at home."
"1","Will never return. Worst manicure ever, chipped the next day. My manicurist kept shooting snot rockets and picking her nose in the sink between clients. None of my nails were the same shape. My friend with me got a French gel manicure and her girl took over an hour and a half to do them, and they started chipping the next day! Never going back."
"1","I have to find a new friend to go bike (Schwinn, not something cool like a Harley) riding with. This is the second time I have been dragged to a Paradise Bakery at breakfast time. I can't take it anymore. There was a review for another location where the reviewer says it looks when you step in the door that Paradise has promise. That is so true.\n\nWhen you first walk in and are looking at the bagels, the baked goods, the menu, the purple lights, you almost forget about your last, horrible experience. Have no fear, once the food is served, you quickly remember. I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham, and a medium coffee. Seems simple enough. They brought me the sandwich WITH ham. I didn't know when I first bit into it. This ham is still alive, it is so tough, I am sure this is what Wilson rejects for their footballs. What is wrong with you Paradise? Why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant. A croissant that wasn't even toasted. Which brings me to my next comment. You stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant? Even Dunkin Donuts toasts the croissant. You have no clue how to make anything. Even after Panera acquired you, they couldn't impart any wisdom into you? And coming from Panera, that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu, which you made worse.\n\nIt was good to taste the same bitter mud, er, coffee, that Panera serves.\n\nParadise, you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me, but why can't you try to improve? You clearly can't think this food is good? You remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her, she had a cute face just to get some action out of her. Someone once lied to you and told you, you had a cute face and you believed them. The fat girl was fat and being used, and you don't have a cute face."
"2","Super big and nice location! Have a very big variety of different shoes for all genders and ages. Staff is super nice and helpful. Went here looking for a certain shoe in a certain size and color and they did not have what I was looking for. Found someone right away that could help me and in a matter of minutes he had looked up what stores had what I was looking for! Super nice and great customer service and even when it is busy!"
"1","Me and my partner has been bringing our adorable dog here since she was a pup and every time it has been pleasent except for today.......... Usually one of the nice girls cleans and trims our dog's nails and never once has there been an issue, but today some guy done her grooming and when we got in the car her nails look like they were butchered and she still smells the same........just for future reference they have lost my business"
"1","I found myself with an hour to waste last week while I waited for work on my cell phone. So I decided to go in for a bite to eat since it was dinner time and the smell in the parking lot was good. \n\nI ended up having a nice time as I set at the bar and conversed with a senior couple that comes in frequently. We both ordered appetizers since they were half price at happy hour and we all had a drink. I had a bottle beer. They only offer a dollar off drinks at happy hour and they are still overpriced.\n\nThe food was ok. The bartender that basically ignored me and had 3 others assist me kept talking to the couple I was talking to also. She never spoke to me or made any eye contact. Hmmmm\nAnyway she said on more than 3 accounts how she loved the cheese fries and onion rings we were sharing. Maybe she wanted some? Well the orders were bigger than the 3 of us could consume and we trashed the remaining. LOL\n\nI thought the Onion rings were grand, but was not impressed with the cheese fries. At half price they are a good deal for either but at full price I would rethink before spending 7 bucks on fries."
"2","We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night after 7pm.  It would have been a 30 minute wait for an outside table which would have been preferable to us.\n\nWent with my son and husband.  I ordered a Mangorita and enjoyed it.  My husbands Pina Colada was also very tasty.\n\nHusband got pork tacos and was happy with them.  Son got a teriyaki burger and loved it.  I had a Hula veggie burger and it was good but I was wishing I had ordered the Teriyaki one also.  I ordered the french fries with cheese and scallions on them.  At first they tasted good but then they started to taste fishy.  (The likely fry them in the same oil?)\n\nGreat place to bring the kids.  Service is good and the ambiance is fun.  The kids meals are a great size.  My two littlest ones could easily share one meal if we bring them next time."
"1","Meh... the only reason I even stepped foot into Rock Bottom is because I had a lunch meeting and it was at the suggestion of my dining companion. I used to go to Rock Bottom in Atlanta every now and then and it was ok... especially if you go for beer / happy hour.  I going to be blunt here right now though:  this place sucks!\n\nLuckily, I enjoyed the company of those that I dined with, otherwise, it would've been a miserable experience!  Thanks for that, Miranda and Ken (if you happen to read this!)  \n\nI had their cobb salad and it was pretty average although the turkey in it was nasty.  Our waitress was slow as hell.  The atmosphere (keep in mind we were there for lunch) was nothing special.  Rock Bottom is the reason that I'm not big on chains.  I don't think I'll be returning.  Even if I'm stuck at Desert Ridge, there are plenty of other dining options that are far superior to Rock Bottom (CPK, Yardhouse, Rubios, and more).\n\nSorry, RB - had to do it..."
"1","Food is mediochre at best. Service is slow even by geologic time. The micro brew is typical and unimaginitive. On the good side the patio is dog friendly. One star just for that."
"1","The food is a tad better than okay. The service is somewhat mixed, it depends who you get for the evening. Some are more motivated than others. The manager, Summer :-), is awesome. Ask her if you need anything or have tips for her to inspire you to come again. If I do a food business, I will\n\nWe love the free wifi. A must for any locale these days. The bear is GREAT. Love the micro brews. \n\nA note in general: somebody get a grip on the fish prices in Arizona please. The only healthy omega3 and protein source we all need, instead, yes yummy but unhealthy quesadillas are cheap. Something's wrong here. Most locations throughout the valley still don't take enough advantage of the promotional built in coupons Yelp has to offer to attract new and keep old customers.\n\nThe five different music styles running non stop in the desert ridge outside area mixed with every store's individual out put is nerve wrecking.\n\nA few big plants and bushes along the iron fence would create a more natural and soothing setting. Atmosphere is half the rent."
"1","I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a \""free\"" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!"
"2","This is always a great place to take my son when it's time to cool down...he loves to play at the train table in the children's area.  Afterwards, he picks 2 books, we read them and go home.  I'm surprised this place stays in business considering people just read there and then leave - but until it does, we will keep coming to do the same.  This place was definitely better than Border's when it was still around."
"1","I've never had a great experience at Macaroni Grill but decided to try it again since I heard their menu had changed.  The menu may have changed but that's all that's changed.  We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before the manager came over to take our drink order, saying our waitress was bogged down with other tables.  I looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables.  It looked like there were only 2 waitresses in the entire restaurant.\nI ordered fettucine alfredo and was disappointed immediately when it arrived because they had ground up pepper sprinkled all over the top of it.  Why would any restaurant put pepper all over someone's food??  Well, apparently they did it to disguise the fact that their alfredo sauce has absolutely no flavor.  None at all.  I have had alfredo pasta at fast food Italian places and it's been better than this.  My husband ordered the chicken milanese and it was covered in some sweet sauce that did nothing for the chicken.  The best part of the entire meal was the potatoes that were served with my husband's chicken.  They were really good.  \nOverall, it was a complete waste of an hour of my life and $45.  I will never go back again.\nOh, and P.S.  Who serves water in gross bottles with NO ICE??  Yuck!"
"1","We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive.  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up.  I mean, we were in jeans and t-shirts, but didn't look like bums.  The food was terrible too.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find.  They claim their pasta is homemade and \""al dente\"", but really it was just undercooked.  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard, or sticking together.  I doubt we'll ever come back."
"2","I don't know what it is we East Coast-ers did, exactly, but it must have been pretty bad for us to miss out on a burger joint like In-N-Out!\n\nI blew into Scottsdale with my mother recently, and she insisted that the first thing in my mouth absolutely HAD to be an In-N-Out burger.\n\nShe wasn't wrong.\n\nI'm a little sad, thinking that I'll have to say goodbye to such fresh, glorious burgers when I head back to Atlanta for school.\n\nThe Big Mac WISHES it could be a Double Double. \n\nThe fries aren't that great--then again, I haven't tried Animal Style yet--but the burgers are more than meat enough for me. ;3"
"1","The food is good, but the service isn't. Weekend mornings are a nightmare here, also they frequently run out of things."
"1","You know, I feel kind of bad for giving this place a two star review, because I really liked our server, but as far as food goes, I can't be that generous.  They do have a great breakfast deal for super cheap, but I went the route of a half waffle with bacon, and it probably came with eggs, but I'm not so sure.  The bacon was really gross.  There's this specific type of bacon that really makes me nauseous, and Sonic has it too, but it just has a sour taste to it that makes my tummy do flip flops.  I took one bite and then left it alone after that.  The waffle looked really promising, but unfortunately it tasted like it was made from the pancake batter so it was really dense and soft, not light and crisp like Belgian Waffles should be.  What a disappointment.  I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations, but the food was just not nearly good enough."
"2","Oh, how I miss this place!  This was our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  They give you huge portions for really cheap. They aren't jerks about substitutions or special orders.  Just lots of normal greasy food.  They serve breakfast all day.  If you just order a salad, the salads are bigger than your head and they give you a whole bowl full of dressing.  I had the chef salad all the time.\n\nSome of the waitresses are a little kooky, but you soon figure out which servers to ask for.  Jeremy was a great waiter if he's still there.  He'd see us coming in and grab a high chair and find us a table before the hostess even saw us.  Jeremy seems to make it a point to go the extra mile for his regulars. He remembers what they always drink, what they usually like to order, their special requests, their kids names.  That guy earns his tips.  He is on the ball.  The little old lady with the thick accent is slow but she's a nice little old lady.  One of the waitresses with dyed hair is a bit too chatty and we avoided sitting in her section whenever possible.  She's definitely weird but totally harmless I promise!  \n\nIf you're all high class don't bother with this place, you won't like it.  If you want normal food for cheap and you want to be full when you leave, this is the place to go.  We would generally try to go when they weren't crazy busy though because the wait can be long sometimes.  Like when the after church crowd gets there.\n\nThe decor is loud and smart alecky.  The food is normal diner food.  It is the kind of place that has a lot of \""regulars\"" that go there all the time including a lot of older folks.  And if you become regulars like we did, they get to know you and you get to know them and the place really grows on you."
"2","Yum, yum, yummy.  You'll want to check these folks out!  They have been on Groupon a few times and you get lots of food for the money.  Really, if there were such a thing as a 'to go' bag for breakfast, you'll need it.  Great tasting skillets, wonderful hamburgers and a genuinely friendly, helpful staff. They made us feel at home and that's every time (have been there three times) we've gone.  They don't get upset about Groupon and stop to chat if you're willing.  This place reminds me of what diners used to be.  Try it!"
"1","Never in a gazillion years would I expect to take people to a Roy's and have a bad food experience - pigs are flying. \nI took some employees and their spouses out for a year end thank-you dinner. While the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna appetizers were great, that's where the good part of the meal ended. My butterfish, usually mouth watering yumminess was so-so and served with white rice. Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless.\nI'd prefer not to delve more into the embarassment that was this dining experience....needless to say I have since eaten at the Chandler Roy's and had my faith restored - but I pressed my luck at the JW location and pulled up a big Whammy."
"2","I have never been disappointed when I eat at Roy's. The menu has pretty much been the same for years, as it should be, because it's perfect. If you have food allergies, they are probably the most accommodating of any place I've ever been to, which makes it all the more worth it. They have a huge drink menu as well, but the 1988 Martini is fantastic. Sit out on the patio if the weather's nice, it's very relaxing. \nThe appetizer canoe is the best way to start the meal: the Szechwan ribs, lobster pot stickers (from what I remember before I found out that I'm gluten intolerant) and the seared ahi are all awesome. From the entrees I've had over the years, I can say that they are all delightful. The sauces are what really make the dishes stand out, which is probably why Roy's is known for having really great sauces that compliment the dishes well. The molten hot chocolate souffle is to die for though. My family goes to Roy's only once a year for my parents' anniversary, and that souffle is what I look forward to all year. I just had it on Friday, and I already want another one. \nThe service is great too. Our waiter was very attentive to us and we had a great time."
"2","My original opinion was that Roy's was one of those obscenely expensive, tourist trap-like hotel restaurants that suckered in hotel guests who were either too lazy or too drunk to venture off the property. Wrong again. \n\nI went here with some business colleagues and enjoyed an excellent experience. Had the seared tuna (and I'm not a fish-in-a-restaurant guy) and it was very flavorful and accompanied by a wasabi sauce I wanted to take a bath in. Service was excellent, although we were a table of 10 with an expense account. Perhaps they smelled blood, or at least this week's grocery money. \n\nMy favorite part of the night, and I'm sure it's standard fare at high end places, was that they brought out a selection of reading glasses when I needed to read the small print of the menu. Call me rube if you'd like."
"1","We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration with 3 other couples and spent over $700.  Service was great but the food was terrible.  appetizers were small and overpriced.  We had the calamari, loco moco,  canoe and ribs.   the only appetizer everyone raved about were the ribs but the rest were horrible.  We ordered several entrees including short ribs, butterfish, salmon, pork shank and curried chicken.  Other than the fish entrees, there were alot of leftover foods and no one wanted to take home any because no one wanted to eat any of the food twice.  We skipped desserts, no one wanted to try any.  Drinks were great and again, service was great.   Not a good nor memorable experience at Roy's for us unfortunately."
"1","Great atmosphere, but food not up to par. \nMy wife had the Mahi Mahi.  Overdone, dry.  \nMy filet was .... Well, ehhh, okay, I guess.  \nThe wasabi mashed potatoes were .... Well, okay, I guess, not much texture or taste.  \nTwo stars is being generous."
"2","I have been to several other Roy's locations and they have always been absolutely fabulous. Everything from the service, to the attentiveness of the staff, to the delicious food, and gorgeous ambience inside the restaurant. Every staff member you pass greets you- at my home location in Los Angeles (where I celebrated my birthday) every staff member I passed even wished me a happy birthday! Mindblowing stuff. The lobster gyoza are wonderful and I am a huge fan of Roy's Trio, with the misoyaki butterfish, macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, and teriyaki salmon! The flavors make the food just melt in your mouth. My boyfriend got one of the Chef's creations with Hawaiian ono that he said was amazing as well. We celebrated his birthday and the staff took the obligatory picture and brought out a complimentary and truly delicious dessert for him. It was all lovely and my boyfriend had a fantastic birthday dinner.\n\nMy only complaint, and the reason I don't give this location five stars, is that the restaurant was large and not that busy. There were tons of open tables in every room. Despite this, we were seated at a table that was literally situated a foot from an open booth nearby (that had a family with young children in it). My chair was the one closest to the booth and I felt not only that I was being intruded upon, but that I was intruding on THEM since my left arm was practically resting on their booth table! The staff couldn't have seated them ANYWHERE else? We were seated before the family was and there was no reason to have us camped next to each other cheek and jowl. It did detract from my overall dining experience, and this place is pricey already to begin with. If I'm going to enjoy a nice $35 entree with my $15 cocktail, I would like to not have a family of four shouting into my left ear."
"1","From the hostesses to the waitress, everything was just wrong. This was my first time in this location, and it will be my last. They need lots of training in customer service and guest satisfaction. They think they got it, but leaving someone standing at the entry without acknowledging, and sitting them next to dirty tables, and waitressses that look at you all weird and managers that respond like if they are so important that they cannot have \""bread\"" because they are too \""elegant\"" is not really nice service.... It is not!"
"2","Just tried this pita place for lunch as they had mailed my office some coupons and I was pleasantly surprised! They had way more toppings than I expected (bean mix, broccoli salad, tabbouleh, 3 different kinds of hummus and tons of fresh veggies). I also really liked their tuna option, as it's not mixed with mayonnaise, allowing you to create your own 'tuna salad' wrap by choosing from their hummus options or other sauces.\n\n It's really convenient that they list the calories for the pitas and for $6, the 'regular' size was a perfect portion! I'm definitely coming back to try their falafel and veggie pita, too."
"1","I have taken my Shitzu Joey there for a long time to get a shampoo and cute, and have not been happy. I was too lazy to go anywhere else. Well now, I'm done with Petco. Their quality is terrible. Pricing is HIGH, and they turnover employees in the grooming all the time. I will spend some time here on Yelp to find a quality, reaonably priced groomer. Goodbye Petco for good!"
"1","After a morning of shopping in busy Scottsdale we decided to stop at Elephant Bar on Mayo to get out of the craziness that can be Scottsdale Road area.  We had been to this location before and remember it as being ok for drinks and appetizers so off we went.\n\nWe were greeted immediately by a friendly fellow and shown to a table in the bar. When I asked why we couldn't sit in the restaurant the waiter said we could and no problem.  Maybe we look like big drinkers and he thought we'd want to be seated close to the liquor.  LOL.\n\nMy husband ordered a Ahi Tuna Salad and said the tuna was really fishy but the greens were fine.  Instead of a regular entr\u00e9e I opted to order off the appetizer menu and got the chicken lettuce wraps.  PF Chang's has nothing to worry about.  Theirs are far superior to the ones I just had at EB.  Very boring.  We shared another appetizer, the crispy green beans. I don't think they got their grease hot enough because these were incredibly greasy and smelled of old grease.  The chipotle sauce served with them was ok and the only thing that made the greasy green beans even a little bit edible.  \n\nIf I would have noticed how horribly stained the booth was that they seated us in I probably would have insisted on leaving.  Unfortunately I did not see how dirty it was until my husband stood up to go to the restroom.\n\nI will pass on Elephant Bar the next time I am in the mood for Ahi Tuna, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, crispy green beans or a clean booth to sit in!"
"2","Maybe it's because I first tried this place on a day I got some GREAT news, but I REALLY like Tea Light.  I've experienced the greatness that is Tea Light twice now and I can honestly say this place hits the spot in my world.  I am so happy to now have a go-to place for excellent take out, which is not your ordinary meal.\n\nSo far I've tried the beef pho, the chicken sandwich, the egg rolls, and the beef noodle bowl.  Everything was great!  I really liked the freshness of the chicken sandwich and the awesome sauce that came on it.  The pho is great and I love that it comes with everything you need to jazz it up on the side.  Since I am not a fan of cilantro, I was happy the second time that they honored my request to not put it in the soup... yay!  The egg rolls are crunchy deliciousness, which is a complement to any meal.  \n\nBasically what I am trying to say is I am thoroughly happy to have found this place- thank you yelp once again!"
"1","oh boy, I guess if you haven't had much exposure to Vietnamese food then it would be decent.  I'm from San Francisco and this place would go out of business in a heart beat up there."
"1","What a huge disappointment. Was really in the mood. First the guy gets the order wrong and is slow to correct the mistake. I order grilled chicken. Seems  simple.\nI have never seen or tasted chicken that looked more like sundries dog turds.\nDry, causing me to choke. You can tell I am loving this place. The man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order. The girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless. Sound good? Took two bites and left. Wondered why I took a second bite.\nSick. They could have cared less. Oh the rice was mushy. Slice of cucumber"
"2","Great theater to see 1st release movies. Cine' Capri is AWESOME! Get there early or go on Monday morning to avoid crowds. Other theaters are more than adequate for watching end enjoying any movie. Local area restaurants are varies casual to mildly dressy (it is Scottsdale after all). Senior discounts are offered too."
"1","Horrible management and terrible customer service.  These people should be ashamed and disgusted with themselves.  The experience that i just had was completely unprofessional. During the entire time they refused to listen and claimed they could do nothing to help until another time.  I know this to be false as I have seen them do time and again what I was asking them to do.  They claimed that it was different but that was only do to pig-headed stubbornness.  I have never been treated so poorly ever by any company before."
"1","Arrogant people. This place just rip people off. I have a Q5 and had to go to Tucson to buy it. I was actually going to go to CA where they had the A4 for $249 lease/mo compared to 379 in Scottsdale (very basic car), Q5 at $499 lease/mo premium plus compared to 549 premium for a lease in AZ, but fortunately Audi Tucson was able to match the price offered in CA. Otherwise Audi North Scottsdale won't  negociate I guess because like they say they are able to sell cars over the sticker price and rip pple off easily. Horrible that they say that representing Audi. My next car will be the R8 and I won't buy it at Penske Dealers. Audi Peoria was by far the worst one offering a monthly pmt of $769 for a lease on a Q5 MSRP $38,725. I would recommend pple NOT TO BUY AN AUDI IN AZ, Chandler, Scottsdale or Peoria. Paul, sales person with Audi North Scottsdale, actually told me to go and get my car in Tucson, Arrogant mf"
"2","I bought the voucher not knowing when I would use it. Then a carwash broke my windshield wipers on my brand new Q7 and the voucher came in very handy! I saved $25! Thanks YELP and Audi!"
"1","Traveling through Phoenix, we were just looking for a light, quick bite to eat. We pulled up to one of the twin ordering stations. I thought this was a neat concept until I witnessed the not-well-thought-out merging process. The line from the second station was a straight shot to the pick-up window and the line from the first station had to merge into that line. It was a microcosm of Phoenix freeways at a McDonalds, complete with traffic jams and crazy drivers.\n\nThe food: My McBurger was dry and tasteless; my wife's chicken McNuggets were petrified and they forgot the ranch dipping sauce, which made her realize that the sauce is the only thing that saves them. \n\nThis location is convenient to the freeway, but next time we are passing through I think we'll just keep going."
"1","This was the second time that I have been here, the first we dined in and didn't think too much of the food, I wasn't feeling too well so I didn't enjoy the meal as I thought I would.\n\nI ordered take out the other night.  I ordered the General Chicken which I thought was deep fried according to their menu, but it turned out that it seemed to be shallow or pan fried, the batter was coming away from the chicken.  The sauce was ok, it wasn't the normal sweet chilli sauce that I am used to back in NC, but it was edible.  The other dish I ordered was new to the menu, the Cantonese style noodles with shrimp and chicken.  I asked the girl behind the counter if they were like Singapore Noodles and she said yes.  I ordered it but when I got it home, I had a take out container filled with crispy noodles, ($11.50) there was a jar of what looked like soup, I didnt know if the two were meant to go together but it wasn't very nice.  All in all, very dissappointed and will not be trying this a third time, I'm shocked as the place seemed pretty busy when I was there to pick up.  Splash out and go to PF Changs at Happy Valley."
"1","Used to be great place. Food is horrible now. Doesn't feel fresh and soup had a smell. Chicken and beef cold inside and all saggy."
"2","We have become regulars here, and the food is always consistently good. Really, our favorite Chinese place regardless of location."
"2","The area seemed a little sketchy at night, but the Columbia Outlet (the only one we shopped at) was awesome with awesome prices. What more can I say other than I wished there were one in San Diego!"
"2","Good enough to justify driving way out to Dullsville, AZ to find some great deals. I hate shopping, but O@A has me dropping not-so-big $ toward entire new wardrobes.\n\nThey've got racks on racks at Rack Room Shoes, where all the BOGO 1/2 off deals on brands like Timberland and Kenneth Cole take men's footwear excitement to new heights. That is, if you don't get distracted chuckling at all the old guys who think Crocs are cool.\n\nI went to Van Heusen to dress it up, where there were some insane deals perfect for me. Stylish jackets to fit this lanky 6'4\"" gentleman for only $70. Unreal! Clearance on slacks, ties, and shirts so inexpensive I don't want to shop anywhere else for my business professional needs. \n\nAfter that, I got sporty at the Nike store. all the gear you could ask for at reduced prices, and I can't spend too much time there without starting a sneaker collection. The selections were awesome! \n\nKeep in mind not *every* store here will rock your socks off. The Vans store blows. The food court is not that good compared to other malls...well except maybe that BBQ place. Hey--a man's gotta refuel in between mass shopping.\n\nOverall, this is THE outlet in the valley. If you thought Tanger was cool, step your game up and make the trip to Anthem."
"1","I don't even know how they can call this pizza! The thin crust is like eating cardboard... disgusting"
"1","Went for dinner tonight at the restaurant, usually just get delivery which is ok... I will probably not eat here again and stick with  delivery. The pizza took forever and was undercooked, no crunch to it. We asked for pineapples and they put so many on it was just overwhelming. Also the bathrooms are just gross, looked like they hadn't been cleaned, ever. I was pretty bummed about the whole experience, what a waste of calories."
"1","This was absolutley the worst delivery service, pizza, management that I have ever had from any pizza dleivery company. The delivery guy gave me the bill first, and I put a tip on it, then wanted my credit card to take an imprint. I have ordered from other drivers at  Pizza Hut and they never asked me for a card! He was rude, and said he would not give me my pizza without it!! Then I opened the box, and there was a tiny amount of cheese on top of the pizza. I ordered the chese bacon stuffed crust pizza, and there was also no cheese or bacon in the crust!! I then called the store manager, who herself did not know how to handle this complaint call. Her excuse for the pizza was \""we are training our pizza maker's.\"" This was Saturdaty night!!! I asked for the Franchisee's phone number, and she refused. So she then said they would call me back!! No call....and not expecting any!! There are six other pizza restaurant's up here!  I have lived here for 11 years, and I was never treated or served a pizza like this, we were unable to eat it!! They need alot of help in training from the top down!! Good luck Pizza Hut. I want to all my neghbors, and fellow residents in Anthem to know about this!"
"2","The staff is friendly and always serve me my coffee with a smile (and I go twice a day, too)! The drive-thru line in the morning is not the place for someone to be who is in a hurry, that's for sure. Nothing bad to say about the place or it's people at all! I am always a satisfied customer!"
"1","Checked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because \""they had NOTHING left in the kitchen\"" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment. Will not come back again"
"1","I used to love Buono's, but over the past year or so, I feel like it's gone downhill.  Service was never their strong suit, but lately it just seems like they can't be bothered.\n\nThey've also changed their crust - the past two times, it was no longer the NY style crust they used to have.  It's still a chewy, thin crust, but it's different.  And their wings are horrible.  Possibly the worst wings I've ever had.\n\nSorry, Buono's.  It's not me, it's you.  TIme for us to see other people, i guess."
"1","Well - they have food that is sometimes decent. \n\nAn order of cheese sticks came out without the cheese on the inside being melted. I politely asked them if they can put it back in the microwave where it came from and they were happy to do so. You could tell the food wasn't just prepared. Chicken wings are pretty good but awfully small compared to many other establishments. \n\nService has been hit or miss in the 3 times I have gone here (You got to give everyone a fair chance right?). I think for what they offer and at the prices they offer it for, you would be better off going somewhere else."
"2","Let's just say I feel privileged and proud to be a nursing student at this community college!"
"1","I never thought my favorite class would be the gym, but I absolutely love it! The people who oversee the gym are very friendly, and encouraging. I have never seen too many people in the gym, it has always had a dozen or so or less in it, so it is comfortable. If you are thinking about a routine, this is a great place to get your start, they also have other classes you may like, such as yoga,track, belly-dancing or karate.  If it wasn't for the gym, I would have been long gone from this school from hell. \n\nAs you can probably see by now, I am not a complete fan of the academics at MCC. I have taken around 30 credits here, and although I have a pretty decent GPA, some of the part-time online instructors are fairly 'feral' towards students( for some odd reason) which just messes up my degree plans.\n\n  MCC has a 16% (or was it 14%?)  graduation rate. The lowest in the nation. You can see the statistics yourself if you log into your FAFSA. Who needs a degree- right? Obviously this is play time. (sarcasm) \n\nI'd say avoid the Religion at MCC, that one is a joke- save your money! I think it is ran by a bunch of secular-rabid-lesbian atheists."
"2","I was here because my friend was having a baby. Of course I couldn't wait to see the little one, so I had to go visit. When I walked in, I noticed that the hospital was clean. I was paying attention because someone that I cared about was there and I wanted to make sure they were in a nice clean place. I noticed that the nurses were very attentive and caring. They helped my friend out so much! Nothing but a pleasant experience here."
"1","If I could give 0 stars I would!  My daughter's prom was after most other ones nearby.  We went here because it was recommended.  BAD IDEA!! She is a size 16.  Certainly not out of the ordinary! Their selection was small.  She found 1 she liked, but it was too big.  Since I know nothing about it, I trusted the saleswoman when she said alterations would be simple.  So we bought it \""all sales final\"".  We knew of a tailor who is good and trustworthy.  When we showed up for the fitting the tailor was shocked!  It was a good 10 inches too big!  She would have to completely rebuild the bodice!  Since all sales are final, we could waste it and get a new dress, or pay for the alterations.  So we got the alterations... Which DOUBLED the cost of the dress!  (and I strongly suspect the seamstress gave us a break because we got fooled so badly by this store!).  Bottom line:  BE VERY CAUTIOUS!!! If the dress is not perfect, don't BUY HERE!!!"
"1","Played here yesterday. Cheap and fun golf, but the staff (particularly the ranger) was extremely rude and unprofessional. Went out of his way to flex his muscles and ridicule us.\n\nBeen playing a lot of golf in the area recently. My advice is to head down the road to Ken McDonald in Tempe. Similar value, just as fun, and a professional and courteous staff that respects their patrons and is interested in people having a good time."
"2","Great tailor. They get it right every time!"
"2","This was my first time here, and it was good. I had an AK-47 \""pinner\"" which is the medium size, roast beef, mushroom, and red onion sandwich with Au jus dip, and it was pretty tasty. The atmosphere is laid back, cool pieces of art to look at, and polite (and dare I say handsome) employees."
"1","We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to.  This is by far the worst place i have ever been. \n I ordered the egg fu yung, it came with 3 patties, just green onions on top and gravy. no other vegetables or other condiments like I have at other places and worst of all it was burnt.\n We ordered Peking Pork Chops and it tasted like orange chicken, try figure. \nAnd last we ordered Seafood Chow fun, it was slimy and seafood was chewy, uncooked and no flavor what so ever.  \nThe top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  \nLast, it was 105 degrees outside and I was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the A/C prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees.\nFirst and last time at this place."
"1","I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.\n\nAnother instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said \""Gochisousamadeshita\"" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath \""Henna Gaijin\"" (strange foreigner).\n\nI can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return."
"2","I'm giving this place 5 stars because I'm a sucker for mom-and-pop places. An elder Japanese couple runs this restaurant (apparently since 1983!!), with no help. Just the two of them bussing and cooking and taking orders. \n\nFor all the previous reviews who complain about the lack of fawning service....REALLY? The elder man handles all the tables by himself. The wife stays in the back. This couple works side by side, all day every day. They make straightforward good food. No frills. Don't nitpick--try to do what they do all year round and see where your priorities are. \n\nAnyways, on to the food:\n\nGyoza: Very good! Perfectly pan-fried, flavorful, and not too oily.\n\nCurry Katsu over Rice: Delicious! I wish they put the pork katsu on top of the curry so that it doesn't lose some of the crisp sitting in the sauce. But it was delicious! The curry was thick and the proportion to the rice was perfect. \n\nTonkotsu Ramen: Definitely did not come with the typical ramen toppings like wakame, charsiu and bamboo. It came topped with Chinese cabbage and chicken. It was almost more like Chinese noodle soup haha. If I were to judge it as a ramen, it wouldn't be good. But as a noodle/soup dish, it was good.\n\nSoft Shell Crab roll: Okay, sushi is definitely not their strength. I would not order another roll from here. There was too much mayo (the presence of mayo was already odd), the sushi rice was not the right consistency, and the nori was soggy.  The inari that came with my tonkotsu ramen tasted a little odd as well. It's ok, they have plenty of other things I need to try on the menu!\n\nIf this review was based purely on food, I'd give it 3.5 stars. But I really appreciated how hard-working the couple works! So 5 stars all the way!"
"2","A solid 3.5 stars (I'm Korean and was raised in L.A.,  so my standards are pretty high).  Like Mexican and Chinese food, good Korean food is another thing that is hard to come by in the Valley (near Tempe).  The only places that I think are even worth mentioning are: Chodang, Hodori, and Takamatsu.  All three have their pros and cons.  I have posted separate reviews of Chodang and Takamatsu.  Besides going to Chodang and Takamatsu for specific reasons, Hadori is where my husband and I go if we have unspecified hankerings for Korean food.  They have a wide range of offerings and they are all pretty good, and my husband likes their BBQ the best."
"2","First off, try the kimchi!\n\nI'd give Hodori five stars, because the food is really great. What ruined it for me was the service. The server, whose name escapes me, was very short with us; maybe it was an off day, but I don't know if that's really a valid reason. We're not a very demanding party of two, so we were a bit thrown off.\n\nDespite that minor setback, the bbq chicken and bbq ribs were take-home-for-leftovers worthy. Which is good, because you definitely pay for your portion. Go during lunch, which I believe ends at 3. Half-price meals, which still totals about $12 a person!"
"2","I have been here a handful of times now. Although I am not a fan of their Soft Tofu, everything else seems to be well-prepared. They also have good side dishes."
"2","Food is always good. We have never been disappointed when coming here. It's a little pricey, but the portions are always a good size as well. Especially lunch. Like most reviews the service does lack everytime we are here, but the food makes up for it."
"1","They food is AMAZING but the service is horrible and the place is so dirty. There were bugs crawling everywhere made us loose out appetite. I love me some Popeyes chicken but not when the place is this dirty. I've worked at a Popeyes before so I know how exhausting it can get but c'mon!!"
"2","My sister and I always go here as did my father when he was alive.  They are always polite and remember our names.  I've taken others as well and they enjoyed it!!"
"1","Chips, bean dip, and salsa was ok. Green burrito, rice and beans were below average. There was no green chili flavor at all - basically it was a brownish, dull flavor. The meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat. The rice and beans tasted a few days old. Margarita was ok, not much alcohol though. I usually go to Rositas which is right across the street - their green burrito (try it smothered in green sauce and cheese) is 100 x's better than Serranos - in fact every thing is better at Rositas. I will head over to the chandler Serranos and try that next time - hopefully they don't bring their food in from the same place as this one.  Honestly I can't believe this place is still in business. Try Rositas instead for some excellent mexican food."
"1","Not this location specifically but the bank itself is crap. \n\nToday was supposed to be my billing date on my credit card. Went into a branch and they asked if I wanted to take all my money out of my checking account. Honestly how dumb can you get? Then the servers just happened to crash. I was told to call the number on the back of my card. I did just that. A few times. \n\nThe first guy did the same thing as when I was in the branch itself. Thought I wanted to take money out of my checking account. Seriously? Okay. Nope. Screw you too. I said I wanted them to take money from my checking account to pay my credit card bill. But that it was whatever now and hung up. I'm not wasting my time dealing with you and your crap when I have more important things to do. \n\nI call again and this guy tells me that to pay the bill over the phone there is a service fee. First thing I did was hang up. \n\nSeriously? A service fee to pay my freaking bill. That I've been trying to take care of for the last hour? Okay that makes no sense. \n\nSo now that I have discovered how truly horribly they are able to take care of their customers I'm really really planning on getting rid of any and all service I will ever have there. \n\nWhat is the point in trying to do what you need to when all they do I say is you have to pay this much more for us to do what you need to be done. Or that the only way we can help you is by making you jump through 200 different hoops. Nope. Screw all of you. I'm done."
"1","Take two shots of penicillin and a tetnus shot after eating/drinking here.  And for god's sake stay out of the bathrooms.  Don't believe me, check out the expert reviews on Maricopa.gov, restaurant ratings...pretty yuk!"
"1","I was here last weekend and I was very disappointed. The staff wasn't very friendly. And someone finally greeted me after I already looked around the whole store. \nI went in to look at their betta selection and I couldn't believe my eyes! All the bettas were in dirty water and there was even a dead one! I attached some pictures of how filthy their water was. It looked like they hadn't cleaned their cups in weeks. I was so upset I had to get outta there. \n\nDONT SELL BETTAS IF YOU ARENT GOING TO PROPERLY TAKE CARE IF THEM."
"1","I've taken 2 of my dogs to Dr Kile and a couple puppies.  He has no people skills and neither do a couple of his staff gals.  He mis-diagnosed one of my dogs and I paid a ton for his services and medication for a treatment that did nothing.  At one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what I had to say.  When asking about a treatment for another of my dogs, I was insulted by Dr Kile.  I will NEVER bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home."
"1","I don't get this place.  They have multiple buildings and multiple doctors in each building but it is damn near impossible to get an appointment unless you call them 7:30am SHARP!  My 6 month old daughter was sick quite often in the first few months of her life and we had to bring her in quite often.  I had better chances of getting tickets to a sold out concert than an appointment at this practice. \n\nWhen you do get an appointment, doctors constantly contradict each other and put each others diagnosis down often.  I have heard the words, \""Don't listen to that doctor, I know what I am talking about.\""  \n\nAs a parent of two small children, that is not all to reassuring.  Honestly, I prefer the staff at Conerstone Urgent Care a lot better that this staff.  So you might ask, why do we still go?  The reason, we've had doctors in the valley ten times worse than these people.  They are organized,  they are clean and I like how all their computers are networked through all their offices.  This place is a lessor of other evils.... I personally think they see waaaay too many patients to have a relationship with the family.  When we go, I feel like a number and a price tag to them."
"1","Stay away!  This place is awful.  We came home from a camping trip to the A/C being out and not being able to stay in our home, so we came here for a night.  The room smelled stale and gross, and was poorly lit.  We could not control the temperature in the room and I doubt it cooled off below 85 degrees in there (not much of an improvement to the house!).  There were 2 queen beds and we requested a roll-away since we were there with our three children.  Knowing that we had 5 people in our party, we were still only provided with 3 towels and 2 washcloths in the room.  The d\u00e9cor, the furniture and the paint are all in SEVERE need of an update.\nMy husband and I thought we'd go down to the pool to help cool off.  WRONG!  the pool area was filthy dirty.  There were dirty pool towels laying about, but no clean pool towels available for us to use.  The pool had some sort of film over it and the water was filled with all sorts of \""floaties.\""  The bottom of the pool was also filthy.  We tried to stick our feet in the hot tub instead, but that was also equally filthy.  The grounds were poorly kept, the trees and shrubs appear to be dying and no one has swept any of the walkways for what appears to be months.  This morning, the \""free\"" breakfast was burnt, dried out sausage patties, completely undercooked eggs, and stale potatoes.  Went to work this morning hungry, exhausted, and extremely disappointed.  Would never stay here again and would not recommend anyone else say here either.  Filthy, old, unkempt mess."
"2","A huge thank you to Brian at Firestone! Yesterday evening I came into the shop ten minutes before closing. They put my spare tire on for me and had me setup to get a new tire in the morning. I got there at 7am and by 7:10am this morning I had a new tire and was off to work. Brian was friendly, quick and efficient. Before going to Firestone I had called Discount Tire to only get rudeness and a lot of sighs about them closing in 15 minutes. Thank you Brian for your awesome customer service! I will always choose Firestone over Discount Tire!"
"1","Not a big fan of the wait, the run down location or all the birds attacking you for the food.  The food was great, but the atmosphere was kind of annoying."
"1","I needed some slings for my JBL speargun. The shop had a decent supply of speargun slings, but not the particular size or brand I needed. The sales guy said he could order them and it would take about a week. So I gave him my contact information and he said he would call me when the slings arrived. Two weeks go by and no call from El Mar Dive Shop. I decided to head over to the shop and check on my order. The same guy who said he would order the slings tells me he forgot to place the order. He asked if I still wanted him to place the order, reluctantly I said ok. Again, he takes down my contact information and tells me he will give me a call when the slings arrive in about a week. Three weeks go by and again no call from El Mar. So again I decide to head over to the shop to check on my order. This time the same guy, I didn't get his name, says the slings arrived. I asked him why I didn't get a phone call, he acted surprised and said somebody should have called. He then lays the slings on the counter, but they are not the size that I ordered. He then tells me that the company they order from, Trident, only makes them in certain sizes and they didn't have my size. So this guy went ahead and ordered the wrong size for me anyway and then tried to sell them to me. I said no thanks and walked out. \n\nI always try to do business with local merchants. These days, with the economy the way it is, one would think that a business, especially a dive shop in the desert, would provide better customer service to earn peoples' repeat business. \n\nForgetting to place my order, failure to call me twice after saying they would, ordering the wrong size merchandise...three (actually four) strikes...YOU'RE OUT, El Mar!"
"2","Went T.V shopping here and had a great experience. Lady that helped us was very helpful. Answered all questions we had to help us make the best decision and did not feel pressured at all by her. Ended up with a 60 in flat screen and are very happy with it. Applied for a line of credit with them. Nice options as well to pay your bill with them, online over the phone(is a fee) or directly in any store which is awesome! I'm all about convenience.  They do also do deliveries for you or you can take home the same day as well. Rule of thumb: if you can make it fit in your car/truck you can take it the same day or else you will have to do delivery.\n\nWill def be back for more home supplies. Sears to me is more of a home place cannot tell you much about the clothes and all that, but for appliances and such i highly recommend."
"1","Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat"
"2","These guys are amazing. I've taken my puppy Copper there since we had him. They've vaccinated him, neutered him and now taken care of him with kennel cough. They are extremely welcoming, great customer service, don't over-charge or over-diagnose, very knowledgeable and willing to answer my many questions and always willing to help. I just moved to south Chandler, but am more than happy to drive the distance for the quality service we get here. Highly recommend for any pet!"
"1","I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than biopsy) performed, and discovered the dog had a sever infection of the prostate. The prostate had enlarged to twice the normal size. The infection was actually located on the outside of the prostate and could have spread and possibly killed the dog.  I'm glad I didn't take Dr. Anderson's advice not to perform the biopsy (or similar test). It took immediate surgery and three weeks of antibiotics , but my dog it doing much better. The cost was less than I had expected. I'm glad I didn't  waste any more time waiting for Dr. Anderson to return my  phone calls and recommend treatment. I feel stupid for even waiting that long, but like many people noted on their reviews they trust Dr. Anderson. I was no different, so I waited. I'm happy with my new vet, but sadly disappointed in my previous one."
"1","Thanks for the reply. I provided direct feedback through the Massage Envy survey six days ago."
"1","Bland, overpriced, and nothing special. The best part about my trip to this olive garden was discovering the italian-style interior architecture of the restaurant. I found the veneer quite entertaining, for the Italian walls were just like the Italian breadsticks, minestrone, and salad: superficially appealing. This place is like Madonna--it's all about the image, baby.\n\ntl;dr: Italian Chilis"
"2","Classic all around good everything, food, service and atmosphere. There is little in the way of surprises but they make up for that in consistency. As you can see from the attached picture the five cheese ravioli was very well received. As was the fresh bread sticks and the wonderfully fresh salad with pepperchinis. Top off with one of the many deserts (we were to full as the portions here are generous) and you will not go home wanting. Ps and you can go home with an extra entree and they also serve wine samples, ya!"
"1","Read below the line of this post & you'll see my prior post.  I am a regular, or was a regular now!\n\nI never come in on Monday's,  I usually come in on Friday or Saturday.  This is the first time I ever met Bale.  I normally get served by Sarah & Jenn (who are the best & I like dearly).  \n\nThis night, Sarah served my first beer.  When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another.  Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar.  I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar.  The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a \""I'm sorry I will be right with you\"" (recognition of some sort).  So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer.  Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened.  Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out.  It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point.  It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that.\n\nIn conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service.  However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar.  I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer.  The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again.  I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix  Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area.  If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care.  The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice.  Bale has got to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLove this place.\n\nGreat dive bar, the bar tenders are really nice, they have the tall boy beers I like & mini pitchers for a good price.  \n\nI was impressed how much a crowd this place can draw in."
"1","We came here around 7:15p tonih we walked in and read the sign that said to seat yourself and we did. The man behind the to go order counter area clearly saw us walk in... we waited,  and waited. For about ten minutes we waited for something... anything,  we got nothing... completely ignored. We left, I wonder if the people who went in as we were leaving got the same treatment?"
"2","Food here is great, had the chicken schwarma with salad and rice. My partner had the same with hummus, I heavily endorse eating here. I'm coming back that's for sure. Also they have lovely baklava."
"1","Before I comment on why I'm only giving two stars, I'd like to say that pedicures here are more like 3.5 stars. They can make some fun and crazy designs!\n\nHowever, I got a set of gel nails here and I will likely never make that mistake again.They left fuzzies from the cotton balls on my nails and just painted over it, leaving the nails lumpy. They didn't really smooth anything out, so there were little bubbles and bumps in almost every nail. (This completely irritated me the entire time I had the nails on!) One nail came completely off in less than a week!\n\nNeedless to say, I would have given them one star for the nails alone, but they did do a pretty good job on my pedicure. Time to find a new nail place for me!"
"2","Great beef fried rice at a good price."
"1","I will not be giving my business to this Men's Wearhouse ever again.  I don't really like leaving negative posts, but I feel the need to inform everybody about the poor service at this location.  All of my groomsmen and I rented tuxedos from this location.  The price for our rentals were considerably higher than other stores , but I was okay with that.  I assumed the higher price was paying for the protection and service of a company like Men's Wearhouse.  I was wrong.\n\nWhen one of my groomsmen went to try on his tuxedo there was a used tissue in the pants pocket.  The pants were replaced on the spot.  I understand that mistakes happen, but we were assured every tuxedo was cleaned prior to rental.  Clearly, if this tuxedo had been cleaned there would not be gross Kleenex in the pocket.  Problem #1\n\nOn the day of the wedding, in the middle of picture taking, the same groomsmen had his top button of his jacket pop off.  Anyone who has worn a 2-button jack knows the top button is the most important.  You can't button your jacket properly without it!  Needless to say, we had to scramble to get the button attached with a safety pin while the photographer was waiting.  Problem #2\n\nI try to give businesses the benefit of the doubt.  If the used kleenex and the button were the only issues I honestly would not have written this post.  Unfortunately, the worst part of this whole experience has been the attitude and poor service of the Men's Wearhouse management once the tuxedos were returned.  I notified Men's Wearhouse of the situation - I expected them to be apologetic and offer some sort of a refund.  Instead, I was told that I would be receiving a call from a manager.  The call never came.  I called back a week later and was told that there was no manager in the building.  During my call a few days later I was told  the manager was with a client and I would be called back later in the day.  The third time I called I was told the manager did not arrive until 6pm and I would received a call right away.  My wedding was a month ago and I have still not received a call back from Men's Wearhouse. Problem #3\n\nOnce I realized I was getting nowhere with the Tempe Marketplace location I called the corporate customer relations dept. I still haven't accomplished much, but this department has been much more helpful in dealing with the terrible management at this location.\n\nI gave this rating 2 stars because all of the other tuxedos were very nice.  Unfortunately, once Men's Wearhouse had our money the customer service has been some of the worst I have ever dealt with.  I had my groomsmen pay a little more for their tuxes so that we could have the backing of a huge company like Men's Wearhouse on such an important day. I am very surprised at the poor service and I will never be going back to the Men's Wearhouse at Tempe Marketplace."
"1","NEVER GO HERE! THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!!! I wish I could give this place 0 stars!! We went in at 5:50 pm (mind you they close at 6pm), and as we were pulling in the employee put a closed sign on, and locked the doors! I went up to the door and knocked, and the employee yelled \""WE'RE CLOSED!\"" I told her it wasn't even 6 o'clock but she didn't care and ignored us!! It turned out she was the manager Sammy.  WHAT HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! STAY AWAY!!!"
"2","Place was kind of hard to find but the covered parking is a bonus. I have insurance so I am not eligible for the advertised specials, but I still feel I got an ok deal. I understand I need Polycarbonate lenses due to not wanting Coke bottle thick lenses, but I don't like the feeling that I am being upsold so much.\n\nThe staff was friendly and put out a mellow vibe, from reception all the way back to the doctor. Exam went well and I had plenty of time to pick out a frame afterwards. \n\nI feel this store needs to move or needs a remodel. I stopped in at their store down in Queen Creek with a friend and that store looked clean and had lots of natural lighting.\n\nAll in all a good experience and a good pair of glasses."
"2","First visit here.  We bought a few different items.  I was very impressed with their spelt and 9-grain breads.  Very good.  One of the better bakeries I've discovered so far."
"2","Great guys, very honest I never felt pressured when it came to the recommended service on my truck. They also offer a 2 year 24k mile warranty on their work."
"2","We bought a home and shortly thereafter found there was a fairly significant scorpion problem. We had an exterminator out SEVERAL times with little relief. We went to Bug & Weed Mart, got a free consultation at the store and purchased the recommended products. WOW! What a difference. Our scorpion problem is almost completely eradicated. We have nothing up on the house. We only found one on the edge of the property where it wasn't treated. We're very happy. There has been no critters inside the house since we started spraying on our own with the products. We thought it would be time consuming to do it ourselves, but it hardly takes any time at all. Bug & Weed Mart helped us to enjoy our home without worry. Thank You!!!"
"1","Back in 1994, my dad and his friend took me and my sisters to Nielsen's to try frozen custard for the first time.  From what I remember, it's more rich, much creamier than ice cream or frozen yogurt.  Since then, I've never been able to find anything that comes close to that creamy, custard-y frozen goodness.  Apparently it's not that common here on the west coast.\n\nLast I went back, because I had to have that smooth chocolate cone once more.  There was a wait, which wasn't uncommon, being summertime in the AridZone.  There wasn't a nice little old lady helping us; instead there were teenagers running about behind the counter.  The entire place, small as it was, felt kinda...sticky, I suppose.  The napkin counter was gross from melted messes and grinder condiments.  I tried to hide my slowly-growing disappointment until I could taste the frozen custard I once knew long ago.  Unfortunately, the custard itself was just not the same.\n\nIt tasted like plain ol' chocolate ice cream.  There wasn't anything custard-like about it.  :(\n\n**Upon searching for reviews on the Net, I found that the Neiesens had sold the shop to a different owner, which would explain the downfall of  my favorite dessert spot.  However, they've recently gained ownership once again, this of course after my unfortunate visit last year, but I have high hopes!  Although I have few reasons to ever find myself in Arizona again, at least I know there's one thing to look forward to if it happens."
"1","I use to love their concert but tonight it was nothing but soup with large globs of what should have been 'mix ins'.  At over $5 a container it was very disappointing."
"1","Ive only been to this place a handful of times, and I think tonight will be my last. The first few times we ate there I thought it was pretty good, but more recently I cant say the same. The food is fairly tasteless, the beans taste like they are out of a Rosarita can, and the rice could pass for TV dinner. Im not sure if this place is going down hill or what, but it was a little pricey for what we got. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, a shredded beef chimichanga that came with beans and rice and a small soda, it came to $22 and some change. Chips and salsa are complimentary. Call me cheap but I can think of many other places where I could spend that $22 that wouldnt leave me walking away feeling like I overpaid for not so great food. \n\nI will say the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish for that reason I could give a better review but the food just doesnt quite cut it."
"2","Little hole in the wall buffet. Very inexpensive for great food. The pollos magnifico was awesome and the owner offered me a taco which he brought right to me.  The only drawback was no beer but I was there midday during the week do I wouldn't have wanted one anyway. I think they have a drivethrough as well"
"2","Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure."
"2","This place is close to my house so I love it.  I also like the convenience of having a decent selection restaurants right in the same parking lot.  Great place if you want to take the family to dinner and a movie.  Inside the place is clean and they have plenty of people at the window and also a few automated ticket kiosks which are nice.  The seating is nice and the sound quality is great.  They have a larger theater for the \""hot\"" movies and it works great if you want to see something in 3D."
"1","Definitely not happy with AMC THEATER PRICES! Paying $10 fora Senior price on  Sat. afternoon after 4 pm is OUTRAGEOUS. We're using a gift card my husband rec'dc for his, Birthday, otherwise I wouldn't be coming here."
"1","Yea I come here often but don't ask for help they make you feel bad for asking like you are stopping them from heart surgery."
"1","totally terrible service. i've been to other buca locations in the bay area and i think i'll stick to that.\n\ni recommend getting the chicken marsala though. it's really good"
"1","This is an UPDATE on January 21, 2011, to my earlier reveiw that follows below.\n\nAfter the terrible experience we had on Thanksgiving, I wrote the Buca de Beppo corporate headquarters and sent them a copy of this review.\n\nI was frankly surprised to receive a personal reply from the company's Regional Director.\n\nIn addition to apologizing for the bad experience, she refunded the money we paid for our Thanksgiving dinner and sent us a gift card asking that we give them a second chance.\n\nWhile there was no excuse for the issues we encountered last Thanksgiving at the Mesa location, the parent company clearly cares about their customers so if you have a problem, WRITE THE COMPANY and you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs for our return visit, took my dad there for his birthday and we had an OK time... not as good as I remember, but still enjoyable.\n***************************************************************************\nReview for 11/25/10\n\n2 or 3 years ago, we'd have rated Buca a good solid 3-4 stars for value, but my oh my how low they have fallen.\n\nI don't often rant about a restaurant unless I feel completely taken advantage of. That said, here I go.\n\nOrdered the Turkey Feast for Thanksgiving because in the past Buca always represented a good value. \n\nHA WHAT A JOKE!  Their use of the word Feast borders on deceptive advertising. \n\nA \""Feast\"" as defined by Webster:\n\na : an elaborate and usually abundant meal often accompanied by a ceremony or entertainment : banquet \nb (1) : something that gives unusual or abundant enjoyment\n\nThey should be calling it a Turkey appetizer, but before I expound further, I want to explain that my wife and I usually share an entree, so you'll know neither of us is a big eater. We went to Buca because we expected to have lots of leftovers over the weekend. NOT\n\nBuca claims it can feed 3 but I could have eaten the six (6) MINISCULE, REHEATED, COOL slices of white meat and 4 tablespoons of dressing by myself. What a RIP-OFF for $24.95!!\n\nThe extra side of salad was missing the usual pepperocini (only contained 1) so we had to request some on the side.\n\nThe baked Rigatoni pasta was DRY, DRY, STICK IN YOUR THROAT DRY and we had to request extra suace.\n\nAnd let's not forget the bread... whoever currently orders this for Buca doesn't know the meaning of Italian bread. What they served wasn't much more firm than Wonder bread and certainly a far cry from REAL, Crusty, Coarse Italian bread like you find at Brio, Maggianos or any other restaurant with Italian roots. You can find better Italian bread at COSTCO than at this place... in fact, they'd make a huge improvement in the authenticity of the meal by getting their bread from COSTCO instead of the bakery they are using.\n\nAnd yes, we could have sent all the food back, but we decided to be Thankful for our ability to go out and enjoy a beautiful day, as well as not cause a scene in the restaurant and spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the holiday. Our response instead  will be to never visit one of their restaurants again.\n\nPLEASE do yourself and your family a favor by avoiding Buca de Beppo at all costs. This company should be out of business so something better could fill the space.\n\nGo to your local Italian restaurant, run by a local family, rather than this corporate theme restaurant that has forgotten the quality and value that made them famous in the beginning.\n\nIf we could rate ZERO stars we'd have done so."
"1","Wow! I guess I'm not the only one that will never go back. First off We stopped going about a year ago only because money got tight. This used to be my favorite place. Its always been expensive but you used to get what you paid for. The meals stayed extreamly expensive but the portion sizes got a lot smaller. The spaghetti sauce was tasteless  The garlic bread used to come in a pizza pie pan and was covered with butter and garlic. It was delectable. Now, $8 gets you a small dry pieces of crap. I could have made this at home for about .99 cents. The waiter and management were very un-accommodating when it came to a $10 gift card that wasn't actually good in another 2 hours. Come on give us a break. No chocolate milk for the kids. Pepsi products BIG MISTAKE!   And the final straw,, The icecream desert clearly said 6 scoops of ice cream on the menu. I counted 2. \n\nSorry Buca, Never Again!"
"1","We went out to Bucca on Monday night. While the food was decent the service was horrible. \n\nFirst we started out with a male server that seemed to find waiting on us as a burden. Then a female server took over who had no idea about service. OUr drinks sat empty, nobody asked us how the food was and the check literally took over 10 minutes to arrive- even after asking for it. \n\nI'm not sure I'd ever go back."
"1","I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.\n\nAll I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.\n\nNO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?\n\nEverything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?"
"2","One of my favorite meals is a good steak and a potato, and I must say, I have never been disappointed coming to the Texas Roadhouse. I love the peanuts at the table. I start eating some of those right away. Iced tea is good and they keep it filled up for me. I've never had a bad waitress here. They wear really skippy short shorts here, which doesn't bother me, just an observation. I imagine that for the guys to get the good tips? The rolls are pretty good, but I wait till the end to eat one due to the honey butter that comes with it. I don't like my sweet at the beginning, only at the end. :) I order my steak medium, and it came out flavorful and juicy. I eat the whole potato, skin and all, its so good. I have met the creepy balloon guy. He's just an old man trying to make a living, cut the guy a break. I just politely said no, I would not like a balloon and he went away. Pricewise, under $20 for lunch, which for a steak restaurant, not a bad deal. If you want that nice feeling of fullness after eating a good meal, I highly recommend this restaurant."
"1","Had lunch here today with Robyn N. Jeromy H. and Rand H, Well for starters almost everything at the buffet was room temp. The food was not bad but would have been better hot.The soft serve ice cream was a real watery type. Any way dont waste your time here there is better across the street."
"2","I enjoyed going to this place with my daughter. Good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. Pick a piece off the shelf, sit down, listen to some good pointers and then paint away. Set aside a couple of hours if you are doing something detailed as you want to get three good coats of color."
"1","This place disappoints.  One time I came in and they stuffed my bagel and lox with so many capers that it inedible, I had to flick them all off.  The last time I came in (and I do mean last) there were a group of teens working... well not actually working but standing around talking and playing tricks on each other.  When they finished making my bagel they just let it sit there and didn't bother calling my name.  I had to interrupt them and ask them if I could have my bagel.  It's disappointing because I use to come in this place often and the service was quick and friendly but they must be under new management now."
"1","This store SUCKS! DO NOT GO HERE!\n\nIn the last month, we have walked in, and immediately walked out as the NEVER have bagels.  There were 4 kinds there today, if that.  I actually had to ask if they made bagels there.  The customer service sucks even more than the selection.  I have almost jumped over the counter on a few occasions.\n\nWe keep going there like idiots, and end up having to go to a different EB on Val Vista.  That one is GREAT!\n\nWhen we went into the Val Vista one today, we talked about how horrible the other store is, and almost every employee has said that they hear about how bad the Gilbert store is all the time.  Then, another customer overheard us and she said she lives right next to the Gilbert store and still has to drive to Val Vista one because of how bad this one is.  She mentioned that she even complained to a Regional Manager.  so she was nice enough to give me his info.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.  If you like Einstein's Bagels, DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE.  They say they make bagels, but they don't.  The employees are rude, inconsiderate and could care less what you think.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!"
"1","If you want to have a bagel don't go here.  We routinely drive past this store to one several miles further away because this store runs out of pretty much everything early and doesn't seem to care at all.  If you just want a quiet place to study or read it's probably good enough."
"1","I had been going to them for years, but stopped a few years back feeling they lacked the attention to detail they once had. This feeling was confirmed recently when issues started presenting themselves. I've discovered incorrect parts (wrong size fuel filter, etc.) were installed...and the freeze plug they left in my engine! A few years back I had them replace some freeze plugs that were leaking. Well, they didn't tell me one popped into my engine and they did not try to retrieve it! A month ago the plug worked its way into my pump. Engine smoked, seized, and shredded my s-belt. Luckily it happened on a side street where I could immediately pull over, turn off the car, and have AAA tow to their shop. AAA discovered the issue, pulled the mangled plug out of my pump. Repair job costing me a few hundred dollars. I say lucky, because it could have been far worse, like the car is on the highway moving to another state and/or I completely lose the engine. I would be leery of their work. Especially with a safety concern. The attention to detail they once had, is and has been gone for some time now. Your better off doing the work yourself or taking it to AAA. The local AAA shop on E. Valley Auto Drive has been great these past few years, saved my car, talk the issue out with me, show me the parts they removed, etc.. They are worth every penny!"
"1","Aah, Old Country Buffet, one of the first buffets I ever went to growing up. As a matter of fact, this and the Superstition Springs one were the two I went to.\n\nAbout maybe 11 years ago, we went to the S. Springs location.  We went there probably once a month and enjoyed it each time.  Until one day, we noticed the rotisserie chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  All my mom did was ask the waiter to tell the cook that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  Then they got the manager and he scolded us saying \""Well, you guys are just trying to get a free meal\""  After a little big of an argument (mellow on my mom's side) we left.  Last time I ever been to one.. until a couple weeks ago.\n\nAnyways, enough about the past.  Went here for a lunch one day, just, you know, see if it changed at all.  Walked in the door and totally remember the winding entrance (be quiet, it's nostalgia for me).  Were greeted and seated right away.  I remember the big drink station in the middle.  There were a lot of tables of course, then I looked at the buffet.  \""Wheres all the food?\""  I know it was lunch time, but the buffet was way small.  I've been to dozens of buffet's since this place and this place is childs play compared to others.  \n\nThe quality of the food is pretty much the same since I last remembered, maybe a slight less.  Probably won't come here again though, there's other buffet's out there"
"1","Very dirty!!!!\n\nAs soon as you walk in to this place you are hit with a terrible smell. You can tell that it is older so there is only so much that can be done. The laser tag itself was pretty decent but everything else wasnt great. The arcade is small and the food is terrible. Bathrooms were clean enough for me to use but all around not an impressive place."
"1","Fun, but for a family of 4 to go two times, it's $78, way too expensive to come back!!"
"1","Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10. \n\nThe hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink\n\nI finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables. \n\nIt wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience."
"1","Place works very slow the severs keep playing around and when I got my spinach artichoke dip there was noodles on the inside of it."
"1","I had the teriyaki chicken, which was pretty good and very flavorful. The cashier, who seemed to be the owners son, was rude and could not crack a smile or thank me for my business. He loudly spouted off his views on gun control, which I think as an associate was inappropriate. He also got into a verbal disagreement with the customer ahead of me due to the fact that the associate would not get off the phone with his father to assist the paying customer. He yelled at the customer and was extremely disrespectful. I didn't appreciate the way I was treated, and I can certainly find a chicken teriyaki elsewhere."
"2","Great sushi.  I've been coming here for the past 5 years.  Their service can be a little slow at times, especially weekend nights.  However the rolls & sushimi are top notch."
"2","Love this place! I try to come here as often as I can. Great sushi and great service. Definitely recommend!"
"2","Yum. Baja fresh is the place to go if you want something a step up from Chipotle in variety and warmth as far as the food goes. \nIt's not finger licking if I don't have this I\""m gonna die good, but the food is made fresh, and the customer service is always excellent\nHighlight: the plethora of salsa choices as well as fresh cut limes for your meal & if you so choose your coke like beverage. :)"
"1","I like Trader Joe's, just not a big fan of this location.  It's an extremely small store and someone always seems to be crawling up your arse.  They got a weird parking lot too.  I drive a few more miles and go to the Traders located on McKlintock & Gaudalupe."
"2","One of my favorite places to shop at! Their food is amazing and a lot of their stuff you can't find at your local grocery store. They have quality flower bouquets that are cheap. I love how they have little shopping carts so that your children won't be bored and can help you out. I obviously know that if I go on a weekend it will be busier than going on a weekday. It shouldn't be such a surprise since its like that everywhere else you go."
"1","Was here recently and service was terrible plus food was not as tasty as it has been at other Macaroni Grills I have been to.  Our waitress disappeared for a good 20 minutes before she even brought us water.Took forever to get our food and it was mediocre.  I was really surprised because I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills in valley, Tucson and in other states."
"1","I went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience. We got there early, and there were only a few people working there. This resulted in us waiting quite a bit to be seated and to get service. We both got the make your own pasta and I got a side caesar salad. I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland. I had a mix of arrabiata sauce and garlic...two strong flavors....yet it had no flavor. I just wish I remembered how much this place is not good before I decide to go there again."
"1","Service was bad and food was subpar."
"1","Horrible place! Do not take your pet to Dr Archuleta. I took my boxer here to be neutered and within 2 days his testicles started swelling. My husband took him back in and the vet blamed us. Said he was to active. He was gated in a 4ft by 5ft area. This is a full grown boxer. Noway was he too active! They gave an anti inflammatory but no antibiotic. Oh and if course they charged us for it! They next day they were even worse so we took him to our regular vet to find out he had an internal infection due to how rough and unsanitary Dr Archuleta was. In turn my poor baby had to have drain tubes put in to get rid of the infection. They might be low cost but in the long run it cost us 4 times what it should have and my baby shouldn't have had to go thru this! Supposedly they are suppose to care about animals but all they care about is their bottom line! If they did care they wouldn't be so rough and hurt them!! I did go back and let them know what my own vet had determined and Dr Archuleta wouldn't even come out to talk to me. The girl at the desk was as far as I got and she could of cared less. She was so rude! I will NEVER refer anyone to them. Not after they almost killed my baby!"
"1","Had take out from this location.  They forgot several items and skimped on food.  I purchased about $70.00 worth of food and even I called to inform the manager what happened he said he would fix it and compensate me... I got a $10.00 voucher in the mail about two Weeks later... Just a few dollars shy and a couple days to late..."
"2","Chilis has really stepped up their service and quality of food. Our experience today was awesome. We are regulars so the change is service is noticeable. We will be back for sure."
"1","Just back from the worst lunch experience I have ever had.  My husband has a \""NO CHILIS\"" policy and I need to follow that.  \n\nArrived and were seated immediately by being asked to take a booth in the bar area. Plenty of available tables but none the less, was asked to sit there.  We were greeted by a nice enough server and she explained the new MiniPad system.  We immediately ordered strawberry lemonade and iced tea.  (2 of us)\n\nWhen the drinks arrived, we ordered from the menu.  My lunch partner had the steak fajitas and I thought to try something new on the menu, Chipotle Shrimp Bowl  The photo looked wonderful.\n\n40 minutes later... yes, FORTY MINUTES LATER...and after seven other tables seated AFTER US by at least 10 minutes were served, our food arrived.  I was famished.  \n\nFirst bite of my bowl was a piece of chipotle shrimp and lettuce and the food was COLD.  Odd, I thought this was grilled shrimp.  So, I bit into another one and yep, cold.  So I broke open one and it was raw.  Yep.  Raw shrimp.\n\nI called the manager over who seemed amazed the food was cold and didn't really respond that it took 40 minutes to arrive and offered me a bowl of soup.  (its 110 degrees outside today.)\n\nNo thank you.  Just the check please.  After 10 minutes, we received a to go order we placed 30 minutes prior and now the server had a huge attitude with us.  I guess being angry at waiting so long and getting raw shrimp served to us is no reason to be upset in her world.\n\nI left a 1.00 tip and we left.  \n\nI will not go back here and I urge anybody reading this... find someplace else to go."
"1","I have been saving money to get married recently, but we got a gift card for OTB, Chilis, Macaroni Grill or someother place I haven't heard of (Italian).  We always go to Chili's so we decided to go here.  I have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay.  The chips were okay and the salsa was great.  It seemed fresh.  We got good service and the fiancee ordered a margarita which was tasty.  I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I do at a more authentic Mexican resaurant.  I ordered a chicken chimichanga and rice and beans and the refried beans have not been my favorite and nothing about the experience was bad there, but I just have no desire to go back any time soon.  The service was good, but this place was sort of blah.  If I lived back in Pennsylvania, it would be okay Mexican food, but out here in AZ it is nothing to go crazy for."
"2","Ok, so I recieved a free car wash from my Car Dealership to this place. I  admit, this was my first experience with Full Circle Auto Wash.  I guess they have several valley wide locations, and they are a full service auto salon.  \n\nI rolled up on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a ton of people.  Um, there wasnt.  I was a little surprised. Its a Sunday afternoon, the weather is nice, and Im like the only one there. Ok, so I roll up and it takes the guy a minute to come over to my car.  The first guy greets me and asks if I want the stone cracks in my windshield fixed.  No thanks!  \n\nThen, the order guy comes to my window, and asks what I want done.  I said that Ive never been here before and only want what the coupon says, which is a free basic wash.  I also mentioned that since I havent washed my car in a while, I have some dirt and breakdust buildup on my wheels, and if they could just make sure to get it all off for me, that would be great.  He told me that they just do basic stuff to the wheels, and if I want to pay an extra $3, they can shine my wheels for me.  I told him I didnt want my wheels shined, I just wanted to make sure that they were clean! \n\nI find that this place is comparable to a Dannys, but they do not have as many valley wide locations as Dannys does.  \nThe car itself came out clean, and the tires looked fine. I was happy with the service, and the car came out lookin good!  I will be back!"
"1","They wanted to charge me additional because my vehicle was \""over sized\"".   A Scion is over-sized?  Give me a break.   The fella was so rude.  I was the only one there - I guess they really need to make the extra $1.   I'll be finding a new place for oil changes and car washes ..... for all four of our vehicles!"
"1","Not impressed, windows were smudged, water spots on both sides doors, windows, and top of my toyota. Way over priced for the quality. I went back next day to have the car touched up, no such luck. This business just lost my business. I even gave the employee 5 dollars when he finished my car later realized that they did a half aas job."
"1","Good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we felt ignored by the staff.  We had to flag down servers for drinks and condiments.  The manager spent most the time we were there chatting with friends at the bar and watching the game.  This was not our first visit but it was our last."
"2","Came in just to see Jen V. Food is fantasric. Ambiance is upscale but environment is still family friendly."
"2","Love it! I work near Giant and it's great to go for lunch. Ask for santa fe chili's to go with your burgers. Chocolate shake is good too and the employees are totally friendly. :)"
"2","I liked this place... because it's a local owned place with delicious greasy food. This place was written up in the East Valley Trib in one of their \""5 to try\"" pieces, which is where I first heard about it. But, I actually think it's funnier that I have been in \""Hall of Fame\"", a store located direclty next door several times and never given Giant Hamburgers a second glance. \n\nYou walk into this place, past a grouping of tables and booths (only about 15 tables in the entire place)  to the cash register where you order your meal. We each got a burger and fries and they were both great, a real gut-bomb, but sometimes you're in the mood for something that fits just that description. We sat and ate, and they came to bus our table for us. \n\nOn the way out, we noticed the \""Yelp\"" sticker on the door. Bonus points."
"1","So, here's the deal... and I kind of feel bad for only two stars...\nWe went here for breakfast.  And the breakfast was okay.  It was... well... average.  I'm no cook- I'm a career girl.  But my breakfasts made at home KILL over what we got.  I was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.  It was a rare Sunday morning alone with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we decided to monumentally Have Breakfast.  \nI, of course, consulted my fellow Yelpers, who are generally the smartest, best, and brightest in the world... and having been to Giant Hamburgers for,well, a Giant Hamburger,years previously (which was FREAKING AMAZING) I thought that I could not go wrong in suggesting this place to my husband.  Many Yelpers highly recommended G.H. for breakfast so HOW could we go wrong?  And off we went.\nBetween the two of us, we were able to sample a fair range of food.\nOkay, so the toast was just cheap bread (think 2 loaves for $1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways) the eggs were very plain and bland... bacon was okayyyyy (and I love bacon with an unholy passion so it's rare that bacon doesn't blow my skirt up) but just cheap, thin cuts, not particularly underdone but not the usual glory that bacon is.  I will say that I did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy, but I would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were pre-packaged generic, not fresh/hand-made.  \nThe staff there is truly nice, and I like the personal service.  Saying hello.  Eye contact.  Genuine niceness.  This was consistent with my experience there a few years back, and it hasn't changed.  This kind of services is worth BUCKETS of cred in my book.\nWhat I *SEVERELY DISLIKED* was being the only english-speaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.  At one point, all the staff were speaking spanish, and after one older couple left, all of the diners were speaking spanish, and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of Guadalupe.  But without great food.  It was uncomfortable enough that we finished up, left some food behind, and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have. \nSo, although I am a big fan of the Giant Hamburgers at Giant Hamburger... I just didn't feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did."
"1","I love this kind of place. \nUnassuming, local greasy spoon-style diner. The staff was as friendly as could be. It was a Sunday, people were chatting. We ordered at the counter, got out glasses filled up with soda and took a seat.\nThe wait was longer than most fast foodies are used to, but to me, it was expected and welcome, fresh diner food made to order takes a tad longer than a microwave.\nThe Bride and I both had a Giant cheeseburger w fries. Granddaughter has hot dog and grandsaon a burger. (the kids being 5 and 12 were the ones who were used to fast food times) \nWhen brought to the table, the burger as shown in yelpers photo's... nothing magical, and certainly by todays indulgent standards FAR from \""giant\"" but a solid diner burger.\nFresh fries, nice hot, and crispy.\nHot dog, was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun.\n\nSo hey buddy... whats up with two stars?\nThe burger was as dry as could be! I couldn't understand it, fresh meat, not sitting out under a lamp to become shoe leather... (I've seen some sins done to meat in diners let me tell ya!)\n\nThen I saw that when cooking the patty, the cook puts one of those bacon weights on it and leaves it there. I could see the fat being squeezed out of it. \nLike greasy tears.\n\nPerhaps the breakfast is good, I don't know, seems like the sort of place it would be OK. But I just cant give more than two stars,,, \nI wanted to like it more, but frankly, a dry patty is a deal breaker to me."
"2","My wife and myself went to Giant Hamburgers.  This place is very simple, but the hamburgers are good.  My wife liked the hamburger she ordered.  Be careful though in this place, as most stuff here is calorie laden.  Be aware."
"2","I had not heard of this place until my sister brought it up.  We were planning a place for my birthday that my nephews and I both could enjoy and this was the perfect fit.  An adult Chuck E Cheese.  \n\nThe pizza was that of an adult entertain place as it wasn't the best however it wasn't horrible either.  You go there for the Organ and thankful you have some adults options for drinks and food.  \n\nWe all enjoyed looking at all the all the stuff going on around you and the kids liked they could be kids.  \n\nWould I go back?  Yes, I would as it is a one of a kind.  As for being hungry for a good pizza, well, you're in the valley; good pizza is hard to find period!"
"2","Five star for the experience and the amazing organ player who apparently knows every song in the world by memory! Pizza is better than a Peter Piperish place, but that's definitely not why you go. The organ is amazing and the kids love it. The history of it is pretty cool too!"
"2","Well we finally tried this Arizona landmark. Everything that you've heard is true. Food is mediocre, organ and room is entertaining. The building is all pipes! It resembles an Octoberfest Brewhaus, with a balcony, and long tables with seating in the round. You pay cash for your food and wait to see your number on a board. You then go pick it up and walk it upstairs. Not ideal but ok. \n\nFood was blah. Organist and atmosphere was something we haven't seen before. \n\nEvery one at the table said, so we got this place outta the way. Meaning we've all been trying to experience it. We have. Now we can move on. It's hard to say if I'll go back."
"1","Organ Stop Pizza is a childhood favorite of mine. We visited this location as well as the downtown Phoenix location before it for years. Now that I live in the far west valley, it's been, easily 10 years since I last visited OSP.  We happened to be in the neighborhood for a Convention so we brought a large group of friends to experience OSP themselves.\n\nFirst things first, this place is visited by a lot of retirees. And by a lot I'd say that we were the youngest group there by at least 50 years...and the glares to the kids in our group did not go unnoticed. But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children. \n\nSpeaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.\n\nThe restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best. \n\nThe single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits. Unfortunately, it's not always enough."
"1","I was in the area so I tried out royal cleaners. A bit pricey I think.....the 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts I had them repair (buttons) have came off again. Being that they weren't cheap I expected a much better job"
"1","I had George bend me up a couple pipes for my custom exhaust, and when I ran into a snag and took the vehicle to him about getting another pipe fabricated he was a complete jerk. I don't own a hydraulic bender or a lift, that's the only reason I was there. What I was asking for would have taken less then an hour to do with those tools. He spoke down to me the entire time constantly telling me that my vehicle was \""a mess\"" and that I was doing \""everything wrong\"" and that he refused to work on my vehicle unless he got to completely tear everything out and redo it, which I couldn't afford. I'm a machinist and welder that has grown up around cars and apprenticed in numerous hot rod shops. I might know a thing or two, and the first thing I know is I would NEVER treat my customers that way. I would avoid this place at all costs."
"2","Great fro yo and the people who own it are great!"
"1","I am so disappointed.  I stop here 2-3 times a week and today, they screwed my drink up AGAIN for like the 3rd time in the last couple of months.  I had to leave work to go back and have them fix it which is beyond frustrating and super inconvenient.  The kicker is they repeated my order back TWICE and repeated it correctly yet it was still not made right.  I was in the food/bevarage service industry for 10+ years and rarely did a customer have to return something back to me because I screwed it up.  No offense but this is NOT THAT HARD!  It drives me crazy when things like this happen often.  I understand every now and then but 3 times in the last 7-8 weeks is a little excessive.  I just don't think I can come back to this location because if I do and they screw my order up again, I might just lose it lol."
"1","If you love long lines and only 4 or less lanes open, then this is the place to be. The lines are long and the cashiers are usually old people who take their time with everything."
"1","The worst experience  of my life. The right hand  doesn't  know what  the left  hand  is doing!"
"2","When you want good Mexican, this is the place. Great location to be happy about loading a Mexican brick in your belly."
"1","Unless you like to live in a roach infested apartment complex, steer freaking clear of this place!\n\nI don't care how helpful the staff is\nI don't care how beautiful the pools are\nI don't care that they have free wifi for all their tenants\n\nI do however, really care if I have to live with roaches.  This place was my living nightmare.  I dealt with it for about 4 months, and then, finally, the problem was resolved.  I think I was down at the office about 1 a week to complain and set request spraying.  The problem probably wasn't the management as much as it was the college kids with the wall of empty beer boxes separating their living room into two such rooms.. But still.  It makes me frustrated to even think about it.\n\nI will say this about the staff though.. They tried and tried for four straight months to correct the problem, and they posted all kinds of notices to inspect our apartments, AND, they even evicted a tenant or two..  So, in all fairness, they really did try....\n\nSo what should you do now?  Buy a house!  Thank goodness I have control of what happens in these walls. :)"
"1","I was there this weekend, both Saturday and Sunday for a Youth Tournament for my son. Our \""home bowling alley\"" is the Brunswick Zone on Southern and Dobson. This was my first time to this particular alley. This was the worst bowling alley I have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living. \n\nThe location is hidden back behind some office buildings. The building is plain, late 60's decor. The interior, from what I was told, had not been updated in over a decade at least. The newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls. (for neon bowling I presume) \n\nThere is no real seating for the bowlers. There are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building. Each table only gets 4 chairs, so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers, someone is going to have to stand.  On a rack, in the corner, in the back, there are about 20 alley owned balls, so good luck getting one in the right weight. The bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.  Whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile. The handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up. It stays wide open, so you can't even get in there. The flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush, so you might want to flush with your foot. \n\nThere are only about 20 lanes, and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents, over the age of 80. They didn't even want to leave for the alley-sponsored tournament. \n\nThe food was just thrown together. Nachos were a plate full of chips, and a tiny cup of cheese sauce. 2 small sodas ran me over $6. The overpriced snack bar didn't even accept credit/atm cards because their phone line was down. \n\nThe lanes were so slick and greasy, they practically had puddles of oil in them. Lane 4 occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling. \n\nThey do NOT have a pro shop. Their arcade games were few, and broken. I don't think they serve alcohol.I did not see a bar.\n\nI would never, ever come to this bowling alley again by choice. Even the AMF on Main that closed last year was better than this one. They should have closed this one instead. If you're looking for a place to bowl, I would suggest you go anywhere but here."
"2","See, when I go to a bowling alley I expect loud and stinky and run down.\n\nThis location though had THE BEST SERVICE I have ever had at a bowling alley.  Likely the best service I have had anywhere in my life.  The man helping was kind, funny, accommodating, fast, ect.  I was really impressed.\n\nThe food was decent.  Was able to order kids meals for the kids and myself.  They didn't care.  Was small portion but tasty and really inexpensive."
"1","Oh my gosh:(  This morning I didn't get a breakfast so stopped at this BK for breakfast sandwich and coffee.  I told her no cheese on my sandwich.  She asked me again to confirm no cheese which I said \""yes, no cheese please\"".  She said \""okay no cheese\"".  No cheese was said by her twice and by me twice.  So guess what I got??? Huge cheese all over my sandwich.  I love cheese but this morning I didn't want any.  So I had to take off the top and the ham which was drowning in cheese.  Had half of a sandwich with just egg and bottom biscuit.  Today my morning started off sucky!  Thanks BK in 2024 E Southern Ave, Mesa.  Last time going to this location.  I can't imagine how horrible they would be if they were busy.  This morning at 9:50am the place was semi empty."
"1","We communicated our issue, and was told by the Greeter that it could be resolved. We waited two hours for a Service Representative.  When finally served she told us, in fact,  our issue could not be resolved. In addition, they did not have a product in stock, sending us to another location with an hour wait. Poor, poor customer service."
"1","Gadz, now there's THIS place!  I went over here last time (before today) to have my teeth cleaned by a student at a reduced rate, since I don't have dental insurance.  The cost was $35 plus $9 for the fluoride treatment that they pushed on me, for a total of $44.  This represents about a $21 savings over the cost at a regular dentist.  Passable so far.\n\n*  Well, it was 26 miles each way from my house, but hey, I'm saving a little money.  The trouble was, girl took TWENTY X-Rays on my first appointment, taking most of 2 hours, & that's all she did!     :-O\n\n*  I made another appointment to go back for the scaling & polishing, & drove over there again.  This time, girl took most of two hours to clean my TOP TEETH ONLY, & that was it!     :-O\n\n*  On my THIRD visit, she took most of two hours, & cleaned my bottom teeth.\n\n=============================\n\nOk, so here's where it all ended up:\n\n*  NINE hours spent, including driving time!\n\n*156 miles driven!\n\n*  No, no, no!  Even if you live closer, SIX HOURS in the chair to have your teeth cleaned is not ok!  I recommend that everyone avoid this place at all costs!"
"2","I rated this doctor's office a 5 star office because I absolutely adore Dr. Stewart. I have been seeing him for over 20 years, since I was a child. He has seen apart every member of my family also. He has taken the time to get to know each of us. It is so nice to visit a doctor that already knows and remembers your family history, medication, and medical conditions. I have seen other doctors, due to insurance changes over the years, and been so upset by my experiences. Now my insurance choices are based solely on whether or not I will continue to be able to see him! He is hands-down the best doctor in the valley!"
"1","I contacted Superstition Springs Lexus via the internet and expressed interest in a used vehicle they advertised. We made an appointment to go out and see the vehicle and made sure the internet person was aware I was driving over 40 minutes to see the vehicle.  I received a number of texts letting me know they were waiting for me and provided me with the appointment time via text and email.  So far my experience was great.  About 30 minutes before our appointment, While driving out there, I received a message from a sales person named Steve.  His message said and they were waiting for us and wanted to confirm our appointment.  When we arrived, we met Rashad the internet sales person and he said we would be working with Steve.  We met Steve, and he was not the least bit friendly.  He appeared disheveled and was the typical used car sales person - not what I would have expected at a Lexus dealership.  He started talking about finding us a vehicle to which I told him we were out there to look at a specific vehicle.  He said he knew nothing about it even though I saw he was holding the sheet that had the information about the vehicle we were looking for.  He said he wasn't sure it was available.  I told him that if it wasn't, we would be leaving.  He went  and got the internet guy Rashad and we were advised the vehicle was no longer available but they would be happy to show us a different vehicle.  I told him the least he could have done was called me to save me the drive.  I completely understand that vehicles come and go, but the fact that they didn't advise me  when they had just left me a message, leads me to believe they were up to typical used car sales  tricks.  I'm assuming by the reviews that buying a new car at Superstition Springs Lexus is a different experience than buying a used one.  I made the decision to go to Superstition Springs Lexus because I thought they were a reputable dealership, I wanted to completely avoid the typical used car sales people.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what we got."
"2","I loved the bargain rack, I got every Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz book for a dollar each.  They also comic books and records and a lot of books that you might not find at Barnes and Nobles or Borders."
"1","Service has changed at this store over the years, good luck checking out in any reasonable length of time.  Be sure the charges are correct too, while you are at it.\nWhen shopping here, the system is clearly designed to keep you in the store longer.  It is more difficult than necessary to find a specific book, as subject matter is spread over several small sections in various aisles rather than in one place.  I get the idea of wanting people to linger, but it is so chaotic to find anything that, in my case, it has the opposite effect.  There are a lot of books though, will give you that.\nTheir buy program is worse than any of the other bookstores.  Less than 5 percent of their half price resale, not the original price.  Insulting.  Worst offers include a $40 brand new release hardbound for 50 cents, hardbound new release still in the plastic for 75 cents, and so on.  Save your books and sell at a garage sale, seriously!\n  \nI've been a frequent shopper at bookstores in many cities, this one scores at the bottom for overall experience.  Any mom and pop is better."
"2","This Fuddruckers location is just down the street from where I live... so I've been here on quite a few occasions. However, the whole \""exotic\"" burgers they've been promoting the past month or so have gotten me more excited to visit them. I was really looking forward to trying an ostrich burger... but alas, ostrich isn't in season until November. I ordered a wild boar burger instead.\n\nIt was quite tasty. I got it with pepper jack cheese and bacon (because topping of wild pig with more pig just made sense)... and it was quite filling. :) \n\nI've never been disappointed with service at this location. So yay for Fuddruckers!"
"1","Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay $30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a $9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well."
"2","OMG, If you want a GREAT BURGER there is nothing in comparison...I'm sorry but I have been to so many places to try something different and I am always let down because I expect it to be better than Fudruckers and it never is...Awesome fresh baked  buns and cheese sauce for the fries...Its a must try..get the burgers medium to medium-well, Never well done....LATE"
"1","Online Sears has a new twist on an old con. Bait & Switch at it finest. I wanted to purchase 2 of these work benches at http://www.searsoutlet.com/Height-Adjustable-Clamping-Table/d/product_details.jsp?pid=13011&mode=seeAll&zipChange=true. The price on the page was \nCraftsman Professional Height Adjustable Clamping Table\nReconditioned Item # 65796  |  Model # 65796\n(24 Reviews) $31.93 - $51.93   Reg Price $79.99 Up to 60% OFF \nThis product is eligible for Store pickup\n\nNOTE: This item is eligible for store pickup, so I tried to order 2 and the price jumped to $79.99 each for a store pickup!.  I was interrupted by a Chat popup, so I asked Elaine for help. Her first reply was \""Might be tax\"" and then she suggested I try the help line totally ignoring my \""How did the price go from $31.93 to $79.99\"". Needless to say, I recognized the \""Bail & Switch\"" and I backed out of the order."
"1","WORSE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!! Don Tuck and the manager Tim were horrible. We were quoted several different amounts, and when we finally got to the end stage he said a final amount that was $100 more!!! During the sales process, we were VERY clear about buying 2 chairs and on the final sales ticket the 2 chairs were not included. At the end when we were upset about hearing a higher final amount that what we were quoted, Don \""checked with his manager\"" and decided they didn't want to sell to us. He told us he's off the clock and that Ashley doesn't NEED OUR BUSINESS. I've never been treated this way in sales industry. Don't waste your time, go to Room Store next door - that's what we should have stuck to."
"2","Great food! Just tried the new zucchini mini cakes. Yum! All their food here is so flavorful and the salad bar is always a favorite. Always leave this place satisfied!"
"1","Ordered empanadas to go. Three orders and $28 later...I cut them open and 75 to 80% of them were EMPTY!  (They werent great either) I called the manager and she indicated this is a known issue as they are made fresh onsite. Ok benefit of the doubt. She indicated she would send some coupons my way for throwing my cash down the drain... Has not happened.  I guess I'll be calling AMEX."
"1","Bad service seriously makes everything else so much worse. \n\nWe had pretty bad service when we went in. My mom got a coffee but when she got it it was cold. We asked to get another and she seemed bothered about it but she brought it. I tried and it was a tad warmer but not hot. My mom was complacent so I didn't mention again. \n\nWhen I asked what was good she shrugged and said she wasn't really sure. OK maybe not true but you could at least make a suggestion about what people order alot? When my bf asked what a dish came with she didn't know that either. Now that did bother me. But my bf didn't want me to say anything so we didnt. \n\nOverall service sucked. The food took foreverrrr to get out and my bf had to raise his glass to get a refill of coke. How mortifying.   He had to do the same for check. When it came time to clear table,  me and my mom started picking up with napkin and piling plates together. We typically do this, but the waiter/waitress always jump in to help. This lady literally just stood there and waited for us to finished her job and pile it all up and go. How easy. \n\nFood was not good my chicken in chicken enchilada plate was dry. I only picked at it. My bfs fajitas were sizzling for about 5 min after plate came out. No joke.  \n\nNever coming here again. Waste of time/money"
"1","Their waiters need to learn basic math. I ordered an alcoholic drink (I AM over 21, but I look younger) and the waiter took my ID and studied it for a good minute, then gave it back, said OK and went off to get our drinks. The drink I received was nonalcoholic, and so was the 2nd one I ordered (I tried a different type of drink this time)"
"1","We went to this location last night for my birthday. Well it wasn't a very happy birthday. Our server was Buddy and he wasn't very friendly. He kinda just threw our stuff at us. He seemed like he didn't want to be there. His bad mood started to make me get into a bad mood. My boyfriend had mentioned to him that it was my birthday and he didn't even ask if I wanted anyone to sing and bring out a dessert. He didn't say anything about it. No happy birthday. Nothing about out costumes. We actually had another sever come up to us and talk to us about our costumes and was super friendly. I wish I had gotten his name and I wish we had him as a server. \n\nMy food was ok. My boyfriend said his pizza was terrible. \n\nOverall last night was a horrible experience. Now I know not to go to this location for a late dinner."
"1","I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \""uhh it's at the bar!\"" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
"2","6 months ago my grandma had us goto coco's. yuk. So when we came to visit again i told my wife anything but coco's dennys etc... It was funny because we where suggesting chilis and black angus and she would bring up coco' each time. but i told my wife i am done with those type of places. So we got to goto chili's :-) i ordered the memphis dry rub ribs. Ive had them before and i love the flavor. The ribs where kind of dry and i had to rip the meat off the bone. It wasnt as dry as famous daves though. The ribs i got near home at chilis are a 5 but i can only give this one a 4."
"2","Having lived in Hawaii for over 5 years, I constantly have a craving for Hawaiian food. Moki's reminds me of little local restaurants in Hawaii. When I walk in I feel like I'm back in the islands. The atmosphere is very local style and the people are totally laid back. The decor has a do-it-yourself feel that IS local kine. \n\nI've tried every Hawaiian restaurant in the Valley and this is by far my favorite. I go back often and highly recommend Moki's to anyone looking for some great Hawaiian eats!"
"1","Horrible.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with macaroni salad.\n\nRice - overcooked\nTeriyaki Chicken - cold\nMacaroni Salad - dry and flavorless\n\nI can forgive cold chicken and overcooked rice, but messing up macaroni salad is a big no-no for a Hawaiian BBQ place."
"2","Brings the taste of the islands here in AZ.  We have been eating here for several years and never had a bad meal."
"1","bland flavorless boiled meat.... i got teriyaki pork, yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thought was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless. my friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table. she also got the vgitarian bowl and it was frozen mixed veggies, carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for $7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold.. the pinapple on the plate was still green and totally unripe. the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies.. i wouldnt waste your money here.. go somewhere else..."
"1","Wow! This is a prime example of why you can't always trust 4 stars on Yelp. (Sad face) I have seen a Groupon for this place multiple times and have been curious about the quality since their reviews on here seem to be great. We went during early lunch hour time, was helped promptly at the order counter, was excited to see the full menu & our mouths started watering thinking about this special caloric treat we were about to indulge in. And..... then the let downs started. No soy sauce, just some kind of mix that seemed teriyaki-ish, but whatever, who needs that sodium bottle anyway. Food came out relatively quickly EXCEPT the side order of lau lau which is what we were most excited about, it was delivered to us after we were done with our other plates. We gave the benefit of the doubt because this is a slow cooked item & we thought they were putting love into it... NOT! It was sooooo disgusting, if you've ever had real lau lau, you would understand how horribly prepared this was. After we worked our way through the dried banana leaf portion, we made it to the treasure... NOPE! The leaf was extremely bitter, filled (using the term loosely) with 2 large pieces of fat globules, a few (meaning 3) strips of what seemed to be dried jerky like pork substance. Enough on that, I'm getting upset again just typing it. The Mac salad with no potato, huh? tasted like orange zest & was low on flavor. The Kalbi ribs were so chewy I had to spit some bites into my napkin because I was going to get lock jaw trying to process it. My better half got the chicken katsu & it was just alright. \nNow I have eaten at Ono & thought that was passable but do not choose to eat there, but I would eat there any day in comparison to here.\nEnd note, if you've been to Hawaii, then you know what authentic flavors are, if you are looking for the real deal, go to Aloha Kitchen. They know what they are doing, it's delicious and less expensive and so much better quality!\nWas that too harsh? I really dislike wasting hard earned money."
"1","Farnworth is a HORRIBLE management company. I finally moved largely to get out from under them. They wouldn't plant grass in front of the house I was renting or fix the gate or a ton of other things, and whenever the city fined them for violations, they'd turn around and fine me for it. I was usually able to avoid the fines (since they were illegal and out of the lease), but it always meant writing legal-style letters back and forth, visiting the tenant advocates office in Phoenix, etc. etc. So it was a tremendous waste of my time, and they were beyond rude every time I contacted them.\n\nAnd then, when it was finally time to move, I deep-cleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extent. I had ex-military guys helping me, and we cleaned it to beyond military standards. And Farnsworth still kept my security deposit, supposedly because I hadn't landscaped the back yard, even though it was clearly in the lease and in tenant law that it wasn't my responsibility. I tried to sue them to return my deposit but their lawyers somehow got the case dismissed and I haven't had time to start the process again. But the point is, STAY AWAY FROM FARNSWORTH AT ALL COST! You don't need the aggravation."
"2","A bit outdated but the hotel staff took great care of us. The suite style rooms were reasonably priced and golf came with the room! Gave us free shuttle ride to the mall and paid for shuttle to the airport the next day. Some of the rooms are being remodeled and we would love to come back and stay in those!"
"1","This Cocos has issues.  One waitress serving a restaurant of 20 patrons...stood for 5 minutes before being acknowledged. Sat like dufuses while solitary waitress takes order for party of 12.  This at 8:30 p.m. at night.\n\nThis has happened before.  Few wait staff coupled with visible dirt, grime and dust.  \nThus restaurant needs a management,and cleaning intervention...."
"2","I have been here twice now in the past week good prices, delicious food, and friendly staff will be coming much more often."
"2","In 2011, I wrote about the local Coco's. This is an update, since my husband I went back not long ago. \nThis time, the prime rib was there, a slice of pie was part of my meal, and the whole pies were on sale, so we got the  chocolate cookie crust pie. \nBy Golly! It was all delicious. I can't rave enough about the pie. Especially since I'm not always the biggest fan of pies. \nI thought our waitress seemed familiar. I realized she was the same waitress we had last time. \nSame amazing customer service and good food, as far as chain restaurants are concerned."
"1","I have been taking my three kiddos to Gilbert Peds since they were born. I have since decided to find a different pediatrician for them. \n\nWe started off with Dr. Auxier but after he kept asking me why I was not Mormon any more and saying that my husband would be a great priesthood holder, we decided to change doctors, giving the practice another shot. \n\nWe started seeing Sam Shumway, and he appeared to be just amazing. I referred tons of people to him because I really did like him. The last visit we were at I was there for my 3 and 4 year old. They both had ear infections and strep. I asked him about my 2 year old and he just checked her over since we were there. I asked him and even offered to schedule another appointment to take care of her if need be, but he did it as a favor since I was already there. Pretty awesome if you ask me. Before the end of the appointment, he does what he usually does, he looked me in the eye and said if I need anything, call him. \n\nSo the next day, when my two year old that he just checked over spiked a fever, I called and left a message. The nurse, who had been completely flat out wrong anytime I have ever asked her for advice, tried giving me advice but had no clue that Sam had looked over my little one the day before, as it wasn't notated. Totally a favor. No big deal, I ask her to please have HIM call me since he would know the situation. A few hours later, the same nurse called me back and said that Sam was slammed and couldn't call me back and continued to give me advice even though she didn't know the situation. Moral of the story, he didn't honor his words when he said to call him with questions. Honestly made me feel like he isn't truly a doctor who can provide care for my children. Bummer. \n\nWe have since been black listed because of a balance past due. They didn't have my new phone number, and I was too angry to call and pay the balance. But the other reviewer who said he was blacklisted is credited because it happened to us too. We are paying it, but it's a sure sign that this is no longer the place for us. \n\nThe billing lady, Jamie, is awesome. But the front staff is always dry and the nurse is dead wrong every time. Once told me to Rush to the office because my son had \""RSV\"" which ended up just being a cough, and another time said that my daughter, who was 4 months old just had a cold and it was no big deal, I finally took her in and she had double ear infections. \n\nA big bummer, but I am optimistic that we will find a pediatrician who seems like they actually care about the kiddos."
"1","I had the day off of work and decided to accompany my wife to our 9months old shots. We have a 7 yr and 10 yr old that have seen the same doctor. \n\nAs a dad I can honestly say my visits have been minimal. Today confirmed this reason.Bothered by bad to say about our dr, DR Guthrie, but let me share my experience.\n\nWe arrived 15min early to our appointment to be told that the Dr is not in today for \""Our appointment\"" but that another dr was seeing  his Patients and was more than double booked. The front office lady said she couldn't tell us how long we would have to wait. Since we weren't rushed we opted to wait. The front office is not friendly and lacks basic customer service skills. \n\nNeedless to say we have been sitting here for 20minutes with no communication, so I have decided to communicate to the community! \n\nAnother major problem with our healthcare providers, nothing more frustrating than scheduling an appointment."
"2","There is no one like Dr. Lewis Freed.  He is incredibly smart, kind, and he takes time with his  patients. Dr. Freed explains everything in laymen's terms. As a medical person, I really appreciate his dedication to his practice."
"2","Great grocery store over all with the exception of the deli department. Every time I go, the deli is packed and seems understaffed. There is usually a long wait at the deli. The store is very clean and well stocked. The staff is very helpful and will take you directly to a product if you need help finding it. They have a great coupon policy, discounts and fuel points."
"2","First off its a buffet , not a gourmet one you see at a high class vegas hotel or anything.. We moved here 8 mos ago from out of state and have been to another location but this particular location has been a great one! We usually go on Thurs nights because kids are only $1 to eat. Cant beat that! The food has been delicious both visits. The steak is Ranchers Reserve Sirloin and is always tasty and tender. The  hand carved roast beef is a perfect Med rare and is tasty and super tender as well. The servers stay busy so may not get plates off table super fast but its not that big of a deal.. We overall really are impressed with this location! They even have unlimited milk refills and and icee machine too with unlimited refills!!!!"
"1","First off, I'd rate this course a 2.5 but there are no half ratings. I've played this course a few times over the past few years, and this last experience really compelled me to write this review.\n\nI arrived an hour and 15 minutes before my tee time, walked into the pro shop and the staff was friendly. I know this place AUTOMATICALLY tacks on a $3 charge for the GPS on the carts, but they NEVER ask you if you want it or not. Upon paying, I said that I would like a small bucket of range balls and did not need the GPS on the cart. Once I mentioned the GPS, I got a smug look, told my total and given my receipt. Friendly happy staff when I walked in, grumpy unwelcoming staff when I walked out. I was not directed where to go, nor where to pick up range balls. Lucky for me, I remembered where the range was...hidden at the end of the drive and around the back of the building.\n\nI hit my range balls and walked to the starter. Took him a good 30 seconds to at least acknowledge my presence. After which, he grabs my slip and says, \""We don't have a cart for you yet, and we won't until about 10 minutes before you tee off.\"" I was like, \""well F you buddy.\"" I kept my composure and practiced putting. Sure enough, when the carts came around the corner, it was time for us to tee off.\n\nI failed to mention, that this was a Monday and I was shocked at how many people were out there. The groups were paired properly and sent out on time. Once we got out there, we experienced wet conditions all around the front nine. This was a 2:16 tee time and it was still soggy. The greens were in good shape, but the fairways were OK at best and the rough was a joke...clumps of grass here and there, bare spots and mud. \n\nThe pace of play was WAAAAYYYY too slow. Each hole we were waiting around and started waiting for the group in front of us to tee off. On hole seven, we pulled up and there was one group driving off the tee, another group behind them waiting, and another group, and then us! My partner called to pro shop to ask if they could send someone out to see what was causing this backup and the response he got was just sarcasm and a \""what do you want me to do about it\"" attitude. VERY unprofessional! Of course, we never saw anyone check up on us. Later on the beverage cart girl even mentioned that the pace was slow.\n\nNot only was the pace of play slow, but the people who play here (and what seems like, regularly) and the most inconsiderate golfers I've ever dealt with. Pulling up behind you while you are on your back swing, then locking their brake on your downswing. Come on! Constant chit chat and yelling when they are 10-20 feet away from you on another hole, and then driving up and passing as you are swinging.\n\nWe nearly cleared the front 9 in 2hr45min. After that, it temporarily picked up but then came to a screeching halt again and sped up when people realized we were running out of daylight. We had to call it as we finished hole 16 and that was 4hrs and 15mins into our round. Drove up to the cart return and after we got out of the cart and was unloading, the kid asked up to pull forward more. He came up to me as I finished packing and was unstrapping my clubs and he was kind of reaching over me to wipe down my clubs.\n\nWhat a poor experience. I won't be going back here for a while."
"1","I have enjoyed banking with desert schools until I moved to Mesa.  \nThe branch located at 4330 E Southern Ave Mesa, AZ 85206 gives desert schools a bad name.  They are by far the slowest location I've been to. I have been stuck in the drive thru line for 45 minutes...when I arrived there were only two cars in front of me and three cars in the next lane. I recently left my card there (100% my fault) and never did they have the courtesy to call me.  When I picked up my card I was told they normally shred the cards, it was my lucky day.  Horrible customer service at this location.  I will go back to using the one in central phx (on 7th)."
"1","Have no clue what type of three ring circus the service shop is trying to pull off.  Had my 2006 GSXR 1000 In for a simple Valve adjustment was quoted over the phone $330 get there first thing they have me do is buy 90 bucks in parts.   Told me I had to bring my bike in cold so they could do the adjustment.  So i loaded it up in my truck the night before drove it there and dropped it off. Day later I get a call bike is done but they tried starting it and it wouldn't  idle/run and was pouring out black smoke,  not exactly what you want to hear after you drop off your perfectly running bike.   They asked if they could look into the problem more I said yes so they disconnected my power commander and found out that was the cause of the problem.  $325 Being hard to believe seeing how its less than a year old and was working just fine the day before.   When I went into the shop to pick up the bike they said they would hook back up the power commander and show me the problem. They started it up for me and long behold it was running just fine just like before.   So I have no clue what were they trying to do if they were trying to scam me into buying a new power commander and also charging me for them to look or a problem that never was their.  I have a feeling they hooked something up wrong the first time and correctly the second but do you think they would knock off some money off my $550 dollar bill nope this shop was very unprofessional and I would advise you to stay away from this shop.  Lesson learned.   Also when I brought my bike back home I noticed an air box screw stripped as well as the case cover bolt.    I HIGHLY  RECOMMEND going some where else for service."
"1","DON'T TAKE YOUR PETS HERE. Unfortunately, they were horrible. They are after all they can take from you. Your pets health is not at all the main subject. I took my cat with an Urinary Tract Infection. She was in pain and I told the doctor all her symptoms she went ahead and refused to prescribe her anything at all unless she had 2 test that were about $350 for both. She as I suspected an UTI but she had to put my cat through 5 hours of hell. The practice seemed disorganized there were a lot of people but they were running around like chicken without a head. They were not even busy or having a surgery in the back. If my cat needed a surgery I would probably take her there because they do seem to have a lot of technology BUT IF YOU supect that it is a stomach, respiratory or even a UTI I would take her to a vet that is not affiliated with a big corporation such as Banfield. Banfield as any corporation they don't  want to serve your pets as much as they want to serve their stock holders. Money is their bottom line. I learned my lesson next time I will take my cat to another vet."
"1","Terrible! I stopped in here to have my car washed as it was pretty grimy from a 1000 mile drive. Now the trunk release is broken, just found that out now that I'm back in Denver. The guy who did the job pulled it out once he was done and never signaled me to let me know it was ready. I waited and waited, thinking he had more to do to it. Won't be back, EVER!!"
"1","The worst steak I have ever eaten. Applebees has better steak. This place was absolutely terrible. The prices are extremely ridiculous for what you get. Go out of business already."
"1","I'm not a black angus fan but my girlfriend is so i tag along,\nHere are a few of my observations:\nPro's\nGirls at the front desk were great and efficient\nThe waiter was helpful and courteous\nGood ceasar salad\n\nCons\nPrice...  7.25 for a margarita and 11.00 for a 6 shrimp cocktail ??\nBurger and fries 13.00?\nMy girlfriends filet was small\n\nIn the end...there are better values out there for sure. I dropped 60.00 on dinner and had a burger , fries and water. 13.00\nMy girls dinner was 47.00 !\nJust imagine if i ordered an appetizer and had a drink as well !  80.00 + No thanks!"
"1","We had a coupon and was craving steak so we went here. Let's start with at 6pm on a Saturday it was empty but for an older group. The decor would make you think you where at grandmas house. The place was dark and was not very inviting. We decided to share the filet and I wanted it rare it was raw cold and fatty. I know they are not a high end place but it was just cheap. Chewy and tasted like it was thrown in a broiler. They offered to bring something else, so I had potato soup and it was bland, boring, and lacking anything that would make me want to come back."
"1","Nothings changed here. Walked up to order breakfast, and the \""manager\"" and crew members just ignored me. Guess why? They were discussing how to increase sales! Priceless."
"1","This review is for Delta Mechanical -- both AZ & CO. I live in CO but also dealt with the corporate office in AZ. I've tried to keep the review concise as possible...but the reality is, I could have written 10 pages on how disconnected the company is and just how little client service is to their organization.\n\nAs a third-party installer to Home Depot, Delta Mechanical was contracted to install a toilet for me and my family. I placed the order and scheduled the install one week out for an 8-10 AM delivery/install to minimize delays or issues.\n\nAt 8:30 on the day of install, I received a message from Delta Mechanical that they didn't have the necessary information to complete the scheduled install. I talked to both the installer and the corporate office to try and resolve. \n\nUpon my first call to the installer, I learned that although he might be a pro at installing toilets, he was anything but when it came to customer service skills.\n\nWhen I asked him what the problem was with the order and what he might need from me, he basically said, \""I've already moved on to my next job. Nothing I can do.\"" \n\nUnderstandable, considering the mix-up...only, he had ZERO interest or motivation to help. I asked that he call dispatch to find out what the issue was or where the disconnect occurred....to which he made it clear that he was busy and that he was already on his way to another job. WOW!...so, I was kind enough to give him a piece of my mind and how unprofessional that attitude was when facing a customer.\n\nThat's when I called the office directly to explain my frustration, having had to take off work for the original installation time and then to be told by the installer that helping me couldn't be fit on his plate at the moment.\n\nThat's when the customer service representative mentioned that she had called me \""one hour\"" prior to delivery to discuss the issue...the only problem is that she was in a different time zone, so it really was only 20 minutes before the schedule install time.\n\nSo, I quickly learned that I'm probably working with people who aren't quite ready to run a business or to handle customer service issues or problem solve. She said she would have to review the phone call order and \""get back to me\"", but offered no estimated timeframe or next steps -- one hour? one day? one week?\n\nClear to say that my frustration continued to grow. \n\nDelta Mechanical tried to blame it on Home Depot, but I sat at Home Depot when we originally placed the order and confirmed that all of the information had been given to Delta Mechanical.\n\nWhen talking to the customer service representative and eventually the Delta Mechanical Manager (George Ramos), they confirmed Delta Mechanical only looks at orders the day of installation, which makes ZERO business sense and probably a good reason as to why I'm as frustrated with them as other reviewers. \n\nI'm still baffled how an order placed 7-days in advance cannot be reviewed or confirmed prior to 20-minutes before install. SERIOUSLY!\n\nMr. Ramos' plan to fix it included me rescheduling my afternoon (already after rescheduling my morning) and to give me their \""New Client Promotional\"" rate with an added $20 off. Now, my bigger question was, \""Why am I just now hearing about this  promotional rate now that I'm an unsatisfied customer and nearly two hours after the first sign of incompetence on Delta Mechanical?\"" Rhetorical question of course.\n\nI let him know that promotional rates are for customers looking forward to doing business with Delta Mechanical, and that at the moment I was pretty dang far from that...having taken off work, rescheduled my weekend, and after spending two hours on the phone bouncing from installer to customer rep to manager while experiencing some of the most dreadful customer service ever -- without any resolution, other than $20 off their promotional rate they failed to offer upon my initial order and giving up my afternoon on top of the morning already wasted.\n\nMr. Ramos' response was, \""It sounds like I should just cancel your order.\""\n\nTalk about CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n\nI did call Home Depot back and we're in the process of making the situation better, including using another third-party installer instead of Delta Mechanical.\n\nI know I'm just one customer/voice, but I let Home Depot know that as long as Delta Mechanical is a third-party vendor, I will be taking my future purchases somewhere else.\n\nAgain, we're in the process of finding a remedy in conjunction with Home Depot, but the ONE GUARANTEE I have at the moment is that Delta Mechanical WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY, thankfully!\n\nPlumbing and HVAC aren't my specialty, which is why I wanted the pros to do it...but take a lesson from me, there are a lot of companies and people who can install plumbing infrastructure the right way without leaving a soiled taste in your mouth. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go with another company that has a better overall rating that TWO STARS on Yelp...you won't regret."
"1","I'm pretty irritated that my 2 pizzas, quoted at 19-29 minutes just took 1hr 8 minutes to get here. Completely unacceptable. I'm shocked it was even warm at all. Though the cheese was no longer melty. And James was hardly apologetic. I'll order from Val Vista next time."
"2","Stayed here last weekend. Friendly staff. Two of my colleagues needed to change rooms (one because of noisy proximity to the elevator and ice machine, and one because the internet connection in his room didn't work), and they were able to do so with no fuss. My room was fine. AC worked great, and it was a quiet place to stay."
"1","I ordered the pulled pork and the cheap generic bread took away from a decent sandwich. I found this sandwich to be quite expensive and too small. In my quest to find the restroom, I pinched my fingers on the space between the lock. My finger turned purple and I was in pain the rest of the evening.  Do not plan to return."
"1","As if our Yelp reviews will curtail visits to this big blue giant... One can only hope, right?\n\nWhen television shopping, what I want from a salesman is a greeting, and a request to assist. If I advise I'm not in need of assistance - it's time to scram, Sam! Oh and don't be a jerk to me. Is that too much to ask?\n\nInstead, Best Buy has decided to take a different path. They allow employees of a different company - a Cable Provider - to harrass me while looking at their products. Who in their right minds thought this was good for ANYTHING but coporate contracts? Are they THAT desperate to stay afloat in this internet dominated era?\n\nI do my research online, but there's something to be said for viewing a TV. I know the specs, and I know my taste. It's really offputting when a Direct TV employee asks if they can help you find what you're looking for and then scoffs when you tell them. \""A Plasma TV?\"" Their idiodic retort: \""Why would you want that? And 2.25 inches thick? You're confused - that's an LED TV. Plasmas aren't that thin. But who do you receive cable from? Can I interest you in Direct TV?\""\n\nGo back to making cold calls and stop hastling me. If Best Buy trusts you to stand in their TV department they should force you to understand some basic information about the products you're quasi-representing. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. I'm not interested in supporting either company. \n\nLong story short: I found exactly what I was looking for and ordered it elsewhere."
"1","My boyfriend was at this store and this was his experience, \n\nI bought a ps4 in chino hills California. I also bought the insurance which , basically anything at all happens to this system it will be replaced with a new system, I guess this is not true. I was told by one rep over the phone that, they do replace it with a refurbished one, lol that is a joke, I called a different store this one here, they told me that because they can't figure out what is wrong with the system which is simple Fan makes a loud noise, they can't do anything or want to keep your system for days until you figure out what is wrong with it., another store told me that, they would help me and replace it at their store , just bring it in, I did and I chose not to get it replace because I wanted to see if this store the first one I brought it too had the same policy, seems to me like some not all of their employee's do not know or are not on the same page on store policies. \u00a0very sad, being that best buy has all the customer's and it's popular for electronics, If you buy anything at any store, please ask questions because you can get screwed even on insurance policies..\u00a0\n\nYour store is garbage. \u00a0I am sorry to say that, I shop here al lot but, not anymore.\n\nThank you\u00a0\n\nMar"
"2","I have been here a few times for oil changes and have always been satisfied. This time Pete the manager really exceeded my expectations! I bought 2 tires and they hooked me up with an oil change, they beat Big O's quote for just tires by $200! For the same tire!!!  I highly recommend this Tire Pro's location!"
"1","I went into Stinkey's to get my oil changed.  I'll give Stinkey's a 5 star grade, btw, but this AZ carwash company can go to the pit of an oil barrel and languish in there. Stinkey's is also at that same address, but they are a completely separate company doing oil change service.  Well, they give out a free car wash with the oil change. This was my first time to Stinkey's, btw.\n\nSo I said great.  They took the car over there after the oil change and they began cleaning it out.  What I didn't know was that they were literally cleaning it out: ie: throwing away a New King James version of the Bible; throwing out a dog leash, ceramic coffee cups, a phone charger, important papers that I had in there and numerous other items.  \n\nI had not used this company for car washes before, I did not expect them to simply throw things in the trash that any normal person would look at and say, gee, that probably isn't trash.  I was still at Stinky's so I wasn't paying attention to what they were doing.  Anyway, I also paid them to clean the carpets. They gave me a discounted deal at $29.99. \n\nI left there and left town shortly after that to go up to our property up North.  Only after I started looking for a dog leash did I realize that none of my belongings were anywhere in the car, including the trunk. My bad? Yeah, I don't think so.  I probably should have looked for the stuff, I guess, but I have never had that experience at other car washes. \n\nI went back there the following Monday and was prepared to go through their dumpster to find my stuff.  Oh yes, I was, especially to try and find the Bible which my dad had given me. The manager took me to the dumpsters which had, of course, already been emptied.  I demanded compensation.  After taking my phone number, he said he would call me back, which he did NOT.  I had to repeatedly call them back to eventually get a phone number for their  \""corporate headquarters\"". Joke. I left a message.\n\nI got a call back half an hour later from the \""Vice President\"" who \""informed\"" me that it never happened.  What never happened?!! He replies that your Bible was thrown into the garbage.  So you are calling me a liar, that I never had all the things I said I had in my car that your personnel either threw out or took home?  \n\nThis story goes on too long.  I am just going to end it by saying this place totally sucks.  What kind of people throw Bibles into trash cans? Or STEAL them?  UNBELIEVABLE.  I will go back to Stinky's, but those people at that carwash will NOT be touching my car again."
"1","Only stayed one night, got in late.  Room felt very tired and 'dirty'.  A/C was loud and difficult to be anything other really cold or too hot.  Was welcomed by a dog outside the exit door in the morning that reminded me of the 'Yo Quiero Taco Bell' dog.  Seemed fitting.  Staff this morning was friendly and engaging."
"1","I drive out of my way so I dont go to this Mcdonalds! How can you seriously get the same order wrong 5 times. A manager was yelling and very unprofessional with a new and training employee. It's dirty and BAD SERVICE"
"2","I came here early sunday, 11:15. The place was almost empty, I got a table right away. I had a Boston tea(like a Arnold Palmer but with cranberry), it was pretty good. Service was prompt and attentive yet not overbearing and annoying. I ordered the crab steamer pot, crab, shrimp, corn cob, potatoes, and scallops. The crab was crisp shelled, sweet and tender. The shrimp was yummy and cleaned well. The sauce that it all came in(butter and white wine) was rich and delicious. The scallops were well done and not gritty. The potatoes were quartered and had a great crispy crust that absorbed the sauce well. My only complaint wad that the corn was a bit over done for my taste, but I like mine very crunchy. The cheddar bay biscuits were great and bottomless to boot. When I left the place was packed! Get here early! My check was 24$ and I left happy, full, and satisfied. If yer not a seafood snob and you realize that yer in the middle of the desert, try this place for a reasonable priced and above average seafood meal."
"1","I would put NO STARS or negative 5 stars if I could!  People here are RUDE!!  Called to inquire about a grill and was on hold for a while, not the problem, when a lady finally answered the call, I told her I was calling to see if they have a certain product I was looking for... Her response..., \""what?, I don't know?  Hold on.\""  Then she hung up on me!  I called back, to try it again, a man answers, said, \""ummm, hold on.\""  Then hung up on me again!  So, nevermind, will look elsewhere!"
"2","I found Ray on Yelp, and given his great reviews, I decided to bring my car to him for its first check up since clearing 100,000 miles.\n\nBeing a typical female, I went in know very little about automobiles. I appreciated how Ray took the time to perfom a full inspection on my car, and let me know exactly what needed to be done on that visit. He let me know what should be done on my car in the future with lament explaination, but did not push for me to have everything done at once. \n\nHis prices are extremely reasonable. I was previously quoted almost triple what I paid with Ray. I have found myself a great mechanic, and will be taking my car to him from now on. Go see Ray, you will be very happy you did!"
"2","Went back and the horchata was delish. Hubby had street tacos and thought the flavor was great. I stuck with my faves, the $2.50 desert dogs. Get two, really."
"1","It would have been appreciated if the guy would've shown up to give me my estimate on a heat pump.  Sheesh, you guys, you may be busy but we have better things to do than to wait around thinking you'd show up as scheduled."
"2","Just wanted to say Thank You to everyone at Arizona Cold AIr for taking good care of my family.  Wayne and Mark are honest, fair guys and the a/c installer Jose was professional, friendly, and showed up exactly when he said he would.  The new a/c is great and we couldn't be more grateful  to AZ Cold Air and their wonderful employees.  Look no further for your A/C needs as they are the best."
"1","We visited Streets of New York while on vacation in Phoenix.  It is a casual place.  Their menu is quite interesting and I was pleasantly surprised at their pizza.  Although not true \""New York\"" style, it is a very thin, crisp crust. They also have a hand-tossed option, but that has no place in a \""New York\"" pizza joint in my opinion.\n\nThe meatball appetizer was very good and the pizza was great. Their menu seemed to have plenty of other options as well - like I said, great food, great pizza...just not true \""New York\"" style.\n\nThe reason for only two stars is because their service was awful.  We went on a Sunday night.  They were not busy at all.  In fact, while we were waiting 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us, two waitresses were busy rolling silverware into napkins and chatting.  When we were finally able to get someone to wait on us, it was clear this girl had no idea what \""New York style pizza\"" even meant.  You'd think if that was the name of your restaurant, you might want to educate your wait staff what, in fact, that meant.  Finally, it took forever to get the check of which she had to be reminded twice.  Remember that they weren't busy.  Had they been, I might be a little more forgiving.\n\nIt's a shame that they receive only two stars solely because of poor service.  But in today's world, even with great pizza, good customer service should be the norm, not the exception."
"2","Probably one of the best \""Happy Hour\"" menus I have found.  Great food and good prices on wine and appetizers.  Try the garlic toast and the artichoke dip...Both are great!"
"2","Fabulous food! Never disappointed! Amazing people, your glass is never empty and your plate is loaded with freshly prepared deliciousness! Family owned - a diamond!"
"2","Great customer service, fair price, the work was done when they said it would be done and it was done right. Very happy with them, wouldn't hesitate to use them again and would certainly recommend them."
"1","I am from Chicago and have only found places I like.  Hadn't tried Nellos and heard it was good, so my wife and I went there today for lunch.  We had their thin crust deluxe.  Was disappointed.  It was very thin, but crust was not airy, like I am used to.  And being from Chicago, I like my Italian Sausage, not pepperoni.  The sausage was bland and was almost freeze dried.  No flavor, not moist.  It crumbled.  Very disappointed.  Sorry."
"2","I have been going to this place since I was a kid. This is hands down the best deep dish pizza in the valley! \""Food so good make you want to slap yo mama!\"" \n\nIf you like bbq chicken pizza, Nellos has the best there is!"
"1","Just an update, I still have two horrible months to go before I can get the hell outta this damn place! Have had multiple issues since and must say the only resolved one is my damn a.c. now that its cool! Calling is still useless, yet walking into the office your met with fake high pitched happiness or cold I dont give a fuck ignorance. Maintenance orders I put through weeks ago are yet to be completed, \""waiting on parts\"". \nGetting an explanation of any charges will result in Maya printing out an invoice for YOU to figure out what you've been charged! I mean wtf kinda place is this?!? If the rent wasn't in the damn 900-1000 I wouldn't be so pissed but its absolutely criminal that they can advertise what they do and call themselves luxury apartments! Can't wait till damn January!!!!!"
"1","Prices weren't low on half that items that I saw. I picked up a block of cheese and it felt like jello, I assume it felt that way because it had been left out in the heat for a while."
"1","I was on a quest for a good turkey burger, it was my birthday and everyone partied the night before...everyone but myself was hungover so I had to wait until 4pm to get out of the house. my partner recommended this place. Walked right in and got seated right away.  Asked the server about the turkey burgers she said they were really good so I got one with lettuce onion and mustard. It was okay, a bit disappointing but I gave it a shot. Fries were bottomless but not great. Ordered the rusty nail cocktail which tasted like frozen ice with a dash of banana no kahlua and couldn't taste the rum. Not rushing back here anytime soon."
"1","I'm officially grossed out. Not only is there decaying food spilled all over the kitchen counters & floor, which is in plain sight as you walk in, but the flies in this place are out of control! This was my 2nd time here & I got sat in the \""fly corner\"" by the exit door. It was swarming with flies that were crawling all over the window behind me, the table I was supposed to be eating at, & hovering over & around me. Needless to say, that is NOT very appetizing. \n\n\""A fly infestation poses a serious hygiene risk. Unfortunately, flies are attracted to conditions found in restaurants, where they can do the most damage. Flies are known to carry numerous diseases, including tuberculosis, typhoid and cholera. Flies feed on decaying organic waste, and then transfer pathogens from their feet to human food and food preparation surfaces.\""\n-via Orkin website\n\nI hope management does something about this as it poses a health risk for its customers & creates a very unappealing atmosphere. I don't understand how the health inspector missed this place. \n\nThere's a difference between a clean dive/hole in the wall spot with GREAT food & a dirty/hole in the wall restaurant with mediocre food. \nYou be the judge...or just save yourself a trip & your money."
"1","Wow, what happened? We were SO looking forward to great tex-mex and we left vowing never to return again.\n\nThere was one girl waiting the entire restaurant when we got there (4pm on Sun) and she was trying her best to get to everyone. When we finally recieved our order - chx fajitas and the chx salad, 10 mins later my husband had to ask somone for the tortillas and by then, his stuff was cold...all 5 peices of meat and a couple of peppers. My salad resembled a kid's meal - could it get any smaller? Yes, it tasted ok, but between the service and small portions, will definitely not be going back.\n\nToo bad, we really liked Chevy's in CA. Will do Chipotle instead out here."
"2","Great place to live.  It's real close to a Fry's for groceries and to the Fiesta Mall for shopping and random other things.  Also, close to the 60 so it's very convenient to get to other places quick.  When I lived here (2008/2009) I had very little problems, the management was always friendly and tried to get maintenance done as soon as possible.\n\nThe only reason I did not continue living here was because I was moving to another state."
"1","Horrible management, also being nickled and dimed for fees as we move out. They target certain residents and dismiss rules for others. Multiple things were broken when we first moved in and continued to fall apart. The only nice staff were maintenance.. probably because we were calling them so often we became friends. Rent elsewhere, the \""deals\"" are not worth it."
"2","I bought my wedding dress here and I was very impressed with pretty much everything here.  The staff was very kind and helpful and even shared in my excitement of choosing a wedding dress.  It felt like I was with friends.  The store is a decent size with a very wide variety of wedding dresses.  They have dude stuff too.  I was very impressed with the girls who helped me because I didn't have a picture of the dress I wanted with me, but they helped me narrow it down and we found \""The One.\""  They are also very good at finding dresses that may also fit your tastes.  Overall, it was just such a pleasant experience and I would recommend it to anyone.  Oh, they will also steam and press your dress right before the big day so it's all beautiful."
"1","We went to Mimi's because other times the food and service has been exceptional.  This time however the server was rude and seemed not to care about us at all!  She walked away abruptly before we had completely given her our order.  When my food arrived it was not correct.  Instead of offering to make it correct she argued with me about \""that's always the way it comes out.\""  When I mentioned to her that it was not what had been stated on the menu she said that she would have to get the manager.  By the time he came over we were half way through our meal.  A replacement meal for me meant that I would be eating alone and my family would be sitting there with nothing to do.  Another point of contention: As we were waiting for the waitress to come take our order we could hear the manager correcting her for something - loudly!  Very UN-professional to correct an employee where guests can hear.  It made us all very uncomfortable!  It will take quite a lot for me to consider going back to this Mimi's!  When a restaurant doesn't really take care of its guests it is a sure sign they don't want my money.  There are plenty of mediocre restaurants around - I want one that is great!"
"1","I have since found out that Bob Evans sold this off and they have gone to a more French menu.  This explains the reduction of choices.  I am not impressed and will likely never go to Mimi's again unless there is a change in the menu."
"1","This shop held my bumper for four weeks and promised it in 3. They were to strip and straighten it . Then after a test fit, plate it. I called on a Wednesday of the forth week  before picking it up and they said it would be ready in two days. Called before heading over. Yep, it's ready. They hand me the bumper in the exact condition I dropped it off. Wasn't stripped, wasn't straight. Unbelievable. Not only does this place smell like an ashtray, they run it like one."
"2","Got my windows tinted here right before summer. Whew! My bartender recommended the place! I was informed of all of my different options, prices, effectiveness and even what might look best on my car while still preserving the integrity of it's appearance! The service was great and it was ready even ahead of schedule.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Their lifetime guarantee is great. I would definitely recommend this place for tinting and alarm systems!"
"2","I've used A Better Tint for a few years on four differant cars, the most recent being 10/27/2010 (H2 SUT w/remote start and alarm).  They have always been fair with thier pricing and you get a true proffesional install.  I would and do recomend them to any one for tint and for alarms.\n\nDC"
"2","Great new location!  Great lighting and well appointed. You can tell they $pent some money on this move.\n\nHave nothing but kind words to say about the service and the selection.\nIt really is one of the nicest, best stocked purveyors of firearms in the valley.\nEven though I tend to ask a lot of stupid questions, they were patient and thoughtful in their replies.  For those not familiar with guns this is a really comfortable place.  If you are a collector or are well versed it's a great place simply because they have so much to look at.  Also, they had ammo.  That was odd now days and a welcome sight.  Also, the prices were very competitive.  I highly recommend giving them a try."
"1","I've been here a few times and each time, my alterations have taken longer than quoted and without notice, and the service I have gotten is more-or-less rude. I have also had things measured on me there ahead of time which still did not fit properly after being altered."
"2","What a very nice place. All the staff we dealt with were so very friendly. The hotel and room were nice and clean. I would defiantly stay here again"
"2","More knowledge, skill, and frankly, understanding, than any other professional, let alone the questionable industry of auto mechanics, I know of. I have had vehicles in and out of here for over four years, and have never been disappointed. Lee and Kelly are more than my mechanics, they are valued and trusted friends."
"1","I've had Barro's before and the choices are ok and the pizza decent, but not spectacular. This was my first time at this location and I came with a few others.The pizza tasted okay, but wasn't cooked perfectly and the rest of the food wasn't overly memorable. The service, however, was terrible and the main reason for the 2 stars. The dining room had clearly not been vacuumed lately. The girls taking orders seemed in another world and there was a distinct lack of communication between everyone. They had to go back multiple times to confirm an order when there were barely 10 people in the place. We had to ask for silverware and they seemed put out when we asked. As we were there, a guy from the back brought heaping garbage cans through the restaurant. As far as I know, that's not sanitary. Also, the kids working had friends come in and start to socialize. There was definitely no adult on hand to monitor the situation. \n\nI'll be sticking with Spinatos or Oreganos for my quick pizza fix from now on. Better pizza and better service."
"2","...and the Five stars are not only because we've known the owners, Ray and Lynn for 20 years...as well as grinding there for just as long.  The food is always island style...which means broke da mouth, bruddahs and sistahs.  And Aloha Kitchen is always the busiest food kiosk at the Annual March Arizona Aloha Festival, for the past 8-10 years I can recall.  (The Aloha Festival is now held at Tempe Town Lake.)  So if you cannot get out to Mesa to check 'em out there, you can stand in line at the upcoming Aloha Festival...you won't be disappointed!  There have been many Hawaiian food establishments that have come into the valley since, Ray and Lynn opened over 20 years ago.   and, there are lots of good reasons (on their menu) why they are still serving ono-licious Hawaiian style food...its da sticky rice, brah....naw only keeding....Its da food!  Try 'em!"
"2","You know that hole-in-the-wall Mexican/Chinese/Italian/Indian/Etc place you love that has pretty solid food and reasonable prices, the people are friendly and the decor is...hole-in-the-wall?\n\nWell, add Aloha Kitchen to the list as your hole-in-the-wall Hawaiian place.  The are friendly, relatively fast, priced for the beer budget and quite tasty indeed.\n\nLike a ripe pineapple ready to be eaten, Aloha Kitchen, um, Aloha Kitchen...I really have no idea where to go with the pineapple setup there.  The whole pineapple thing just seemed apropos to the Hawaiian theme and, oh well.\n\nTry it, you'll like it."
"1","Sorry AK, maybe I was just grumpy that day since I hadn't eaten for a gazillion hours....c'mon, I'm not the only one who goes all Beast Mode when hungry, right?...but the food here just did not hit the spot for our Hawaiian food craving. Let me start by saying the place itself looks like a legit Hawaiian restaurant with it's low key vibe and simple style. The menu has a lot of choices which is great. I, for one, have a go to meal plan when I nom Hawaiian style which includes chicken katsu and mac salad, of course. The food did not taste bad in any way...it just wasn't my style. The Katsu was thin, dry and chewy and the sauce was the tangier kind vs. the sweeter kind that I like. The mac salad was okay but the more I ate the less I liked it...when normally I order an extra side of mac salad to devour with my meal. Again, I may have just been grumpy gal that day but I still find myself craving my Hawaiian spot in the OC."
"2","Use to live in Phoenix while going there for school and work.  Came back this past week and the food was great as usual.  I also brought a friend who's never tried Hawaiian food and loved the mac/potato salad, katsu bulgogi plate.  Keep up the great work guys and Mahalo."
"2","I love this place!  Been coming here since 2000 when I moved here from Hawaii.  Whenever I need my comfort food I order the fried saimin. It's the best! But today I tried the hot wings and I'm upset I haven't ordered them before because they're so ono! A little sweet with some spiciness to it. And still crispy too.  I highly recommend!"
"2","yumm so good, hard to find though! But its the best breakfast place that I've found around here..but I'm still looking ;)"
"1","Crackers & Co is a 4.5 only if we're on a 10-point scale.  I went with a party of four and we were all very underwhelmed with the slop served here.  Maybe we went on a bad day, but our disappointment went as far as the quality of the ingredients, which isn't something that typically varies on a day-to-day basis.  \n\nNow, TC Eggington's is a decent breakfast spot.  I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly. \n\nI wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.  I want to help others avoid going here with high hopes of an outstanding breakfast and come away with a belly full of unmemorable food.  What has happened to our standards for a good traditional American breakfast?"
"2","this place is amazing try the fried mushrooms and wings with ranch and be blown away..........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","This was my 2nd try at this salon. The 1st time I wasn't very happy. I had better hair cuts at salons at half the price. The left side wasn't cut the same as the right side, and not evenly tapered. But, I tried for a second time. Big mistake! This cut is harder to manage then the first. She did cut it very fast and I think she wanted to save her self some time by cutting it less layered at the top. This has left my hair wanting to lay too flat on top. \n\nBoth times I went to this salon I was the stylist's 1st appointment. Both times she was late. She was over 10 minutes late for work and she rushed me out with a speed cut."
"2","Have been going here for a while now..  ERIC is the best...  he does my hair and the kids hair too and we couldn't be happier..  and for the waxing AMANDA is wonderful...  :)"
"1","I wouldn't trust or recommend Eunique Rodgers AT ALL!"
"1","I love the Holiday Inn brand, but I'd avoid this particular hotel in the future. Nobody seems very happy to be working there. \n\nI'd gotten a bottle of water on check-in because I'm a platinum Priority Club member. I lost the cap and asked for a new bottle at the registration desk as I needed to leave to deliver a presentation. The staff member at the desk got rather huffy about it. Instead of getting one from the back room, she called another department and asked to have one delivered to the front. After 10 minutes, we gave up and had to leave. 100,000+ Priority Club points and a second bottle 17-oz. bottle of  water is apparently an unreasonable request.\n\nThe room wasn't made up the first day by 4:30 in the afternoon - we had to call to request service. The mattress was the soft, ancient kind that bounces your bedmate if you make the slightest move. \n\nI visit Mesa for this conference annually and I'll be staying elsewhere next year."
"1","This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, but they let guests smoke on the balconies. Second-hand smoke is sucked into the through-the-wall air conditioning units and  your room smells like smoke. There is nothing management can do except give you a free breakfast, if you complain. Sad."
"2","Occasional obnoxious local but otherwise finest of dive bars ever.  The bartender makes you feel right at home with a smile and is awesome.  Vaping at the bar with $5 worth of your selections from the TouchTunes machine rocks."
"2","I love coming here to watch the latest movies and spend time with my daughter!"
"1","We bought a new home recently and called Shasta and made an appointment for them to come by ,so we could get some ideas and prices. The appointment was for 9am, at 11am I called to see why they weren't here , after giving my name I was put on hold for 5 minutes. After being on hold I was asked for my phone number, which they had already and was told they would get back to me. It is now 12 o'clock and have yet to hear anything. SHASTA YOU HAVE MANAGED TO LOSE MY BUSINESS . THANKS FOR NOTHING. I will find a company who will appreciate my business and is dedicated to customer service, unlike your business."
"1","I should've listened to the other reviewers. Rude and annoyed. That describes the people working there on the particular day I was there. They seemed annoyed that people were there to order coffee!  The cashier was rude and rolled her eyes when someone said \""Oh!  Can I also get a pumpkin muffin?\""  It made me uncomfortable. I ordered a peppermint mocha and when I took a sip it was soooooo strong I felt like I did a shot of peppermint schnapps!  I went to the counter and said \""I think there's an extra shot of peppermint in here. It's really strong\"". The girl took it from me and made me another one. Never said a word. Not a sorry, not a oh no let me make you another one.....nothing. I guess I'll stick with what I know and not change up my routine."
"2","Like many have stated, Chen's serves Americanized Chinese food. That isn't to suggest that it isn't good. In fact, it quite good. We were promptly seated and given menus. \n\nThe establishment is well kept and not too noisy. Friendly service of the mom and pop shop gives the place a comfortable feel. Appetizer soups came out only a minute after ordering, and by the time we finished our cups of soup, our HOT meals were on the table!\n\nThe pan fried noodles were a little on the salty side, but tasted really good. The beef with snow peas was really good, especially after adding some chili sauce (which I asked for separately). Portion sizes definitely worth the money, and it's relatively inexpensive anyways. \n\nI would eat here over Panda Express any day! Better taste, waiter service, quieter and the personal touch of the owners running their business. Thank you!"
"1","This place is a joke!! ATE there once and got some ribs, i gave them to the dog because they tasted like dog bones!!! Went back several months later with my girlfriend again!! because she wanted to try it out and it was the same, horrible place, bad food!!! don't bother going there!!"
"1","Let me start by saying I am not a picky person... But when 3 of the 4 plates on our table had dried food still on them ( mine actually had a cement dried chunk of chicken glued to the back of it )... I figured I had to write something.  The sheer filth didn't stop there... I took my kid into the bath room only to discover it hadn't been cleaned in something close to 10 years... My shoes were sticking to the floor from the stagnate urine, there was no towel paper and poop still in the toilet bowl.  After returning to the table, the waiter came over to apologize in broken English to tell me the dishwasher was really backed up... We ended up leaving as I couldn't eat another bite... This place is great if your looking for cheap and want to attempt getting food poisoning."
"1","I was in town visiting my mom and we got takeout from this location. We ordered Mongolian beef, spicy shrimp and shrimp egg foo young. It was edible but I thought the portions were small and the food was bland.  The egg foo young was weird--very small and tasted like a veggie burger."
"2","When I come home to Arizona this is always my first stop for a  meal/snack when I get off the plane!  There are no Jack in the Box restaurants in VA, so this is always a nice treat.  I've never had issues with food or customer service.  More details coming soon!"
"2","Even if you have been to a Bashas'markets Inc before, you must go to this one! You could spend hours here, eat dinner, have a drink, and shop. Obviously the groceries can be pricier, but that's expected if you go in the first place. Expect to spend an additional 10-15% but probably worth it."
"1","Closest location for a business trip. Dated rooms. Wi-if is useless. Could not park anywhere near my room. Slept soundly. Upon waking, saw that I had a voucher for free breakfast. Went to the restaurant in the main building. Selection was extremely sparse but I figured that it was fine for a complimentary breakfast. Got some bacon, fruit, and hash brown (I mean REALLY sparse selection!!!!). Waitress approached me and told me b/c I had chosen a hot item, I would be charged an extra $6! I was amazed. I politely paid and left her a generous tip. The room was $190 alone for nothing special. I'll have to check the Best Western down the road next visit to the area."
"1","Mediocre, corporately-bland Mexican food (as one would expect from a chain restaurant, even though Los Gringos apparently isn't). The perky waitress either didn't deliver my simple request to the kitchen or they ignored it: I asked for my Chimichanga extra crispy, it arrived soft and doughty. Good chips & salsa, but that should be a given. Wouldn't go back and can only assume the diners giving four or five stars to Los Gringos have never had top flight Mexican. It you think the Olive Garden is good Italian food, this might be the place you; otherwise steer clear."
"2","Great place great service Michelle is an amazing Waitress,  you will given great service for sure if you are fortunate enough to have her as your waitress!"
"1","Hello my fellow Phoenicians and snow birds!\n\nIt's time for another truthful review... I should start by saying I am not a disgruntled employee just you're average joe on the way to a day trip in the Superstitions.\n\nI did read some scary reviews but since there seems to be only one \""hole in the wall\"" diner in the area we took our chances and  here it is in one word..  YUK!\n\nThere was one server and she ran her butt off , although I only saw her once I felt sorry for her as the place was filled.  \n\nThe busboys hauled ass cleaning tables, delivering food and everything else so Good Job to all of you!\n\nWe got there just past 11 and was told we could no longer get breakfast yet 3 tables around us ordered breakfast so we did too.\n\nWe ordered eggs basted but I really knew better... Not everyone knows how to cook them and corned beef hash which I ordered WELL done.  Of course the top was cooked well and middle not at all so I asked if they could put it back on the grill to cook it more..  As they walked away we heard one guy tell the other to put it in the microwave!   Lol\n\nWhen I got it back.... Well, do I really need to tell you?  The food was hot but not cooked and the based eggs were literally rubberized... The yolk was hard not runny as a basted egg should be. \n\nOne of the guys came back and I told him the eggs weren't basted he insisted the were..  I picked the eggs up by the white and it dangled there looking like they were Rubber!\n\nI ate the cooked top part of the hash and half piece of toast and my husband ate his bacon and part of the pancake , we asked for our check and told him how disappointed we were and all he did was apologize ... I told him he should be offering to comp the un eaten meal ..  He gave me a funny look and took back the check and said it would come out of his paycheck!  I said absolutely not and told him i would pay and he shouldn't take the loss because the cook doesn't know how to cook!\n\nI left a most generous tip and we Left... We noticed the help wanted sign for server and cook and I do hope they find people quick.... Especially someone who calls themselves a cook and actually knows what a freaking basted egg is!\n\nI feel sorry for all the snowbirds who flocked this diner that this is there only choice for food in town and even sorrier they somehow developed a taste for this crud on a plate!\n\nThe only reason I was generous and gave 2 stars is because I felt sorry for the hard working staff!\n\nSo there it is, plain and true!\n\nTry it if you want.... But don't say you weren't warned!\n\nEnjoy the weather and  Bon Appetite'"
"2","Used to be my go-to chinese place when I lived in AJ and I visited there last night after being gone 3 years and glad to say the food is still great. Love their honey walnut chicken (but I did notice the sauce was a bit different, not quite as sweet as it was but still good.) Service is always good, but when the blue hairs come in during the fall it gets very busy so expect service to be slow. Great value and yummy food! =)"
"2","This golf course was pretty nice. While it was a bit more difficult because there is a lot of desert and less grass areas, it was still a great experience.\n\nOn-Time for Tee Time: They kept us on the schedule for our Tee off. They didn't have us go early, like I have experienced at other courses. Other courses that start doing that and end up 30+ minutes ahead and then others miss their scheduled tee time, when they are actually on time. Not here. They stuck to the schedule.\n\nPace: The pace was great. There was not the tight management as I have experienced at other courses. We did have a guy come and ask if the pace was ok for us, and we were fine. I didn't feel stressed about keeping up and we didn't really wait all that long by the time we got to the next hole. Other reviews may say the pace was too slow. That is their preference, but I wouldn't mark it down because of that. If you want a faster pace, go to another course that runs it that way.\n\nIt was a great relaxing time of golf, even though my game that day was horrible. :)  Of course, it is always horrible. I need to take some lessons. Hahaha.\n\nLayout: It is a bit dangerous with the layout on some of these holes. One of our guys was nearly hit by a ball within 3 feet. Yikes!  -- It wouldn't have been so bad, but no one yelled out \""Four!\"" -- That is not the fault of the course, that is the fault of the golfer not being responsible.\n\nIncluded lunch: This was great. The sandwich was full of meat for me. My friend ordered the tuna sandwich and it was packed with tuna. Great lunch after a great game.\n\nI would have given this course a 5, but with the dangerous layout of some of these holes, I had to mark it down."
"1","Ate there at lunch today and it took 45 minutes to get a hamburger and patty melt. $23 for both including tax! Won't go back soon. Advised the manager but he just offered that they were \""short handed\"". 2 stars only because I was really hungry."
"2","Went hiking in the superstitions. Great day, we are driving back to Scottsdale and I see the DQ sign. I haven't had a peanut buster parfait since college in 1980. I hit it pretty hard. You aren't going to live forever you know?"
"2","I took my wife, daughter - 7, son - 3, and mother-in-law (not by choice - lol) and we had a great time.  The kids loved looking in the stores at all the different and somewhat authentic items.  My daughter really enjoyed the gold mine tour and my sun loved the train ride.  A definite must see if you want a taste of a mining town in the old west."
"1","I note this is the rating for a Monday-Friday visit. I do understand the weekends are better with gun shows.\n\nI wanted to come here after seeing this place on Laura McKenzie's Travel Show. I really wanted the see the MYSTERY SHACK that defies gravity with water running the wrong way and gravity that makes you walk on a diagonal.\n\n My main reason for the two star rating is because the website states the mystery shack is open 10-5 and it clearly wasn't. We also saw to call for seasonal hours and when we called the number it just rang and rang with nobody to answer. I think the charge to enter the mystery shack would have been  $5.00 a person if it was open.\n\nThe reptile house was also closed. \nThe Ice Cream and Salsa House were also closed.\n\nI saw the museum ($1.00) it was very dusty and had an old Robert Redford's Buffalo Coat from a Movie he was in.\n\nIt doesn't take long to walk the grounds.\n\nIt's free to enter.\n\nThey have a Church on the grounds were you can pray.\n\nI wouldn't say don't go here but I recommend to wait for the weekend so maybe everything might be open and you might see the gun shows."
"1","We ventured to Feedbag tonight and were not impressed with the food. The service was very good and portion sizes were nice but the instant macaroni and cheese and instant mashed potatoes left us disappointed."
"1","Our visit at this Arby's was a joke! The couple of clowns working around 8:00pm on 06/08/14, were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood. Seemed that there was one cook, one blonde girl cleaning the dining area, and a shift manager, named Jasmine. The shift manager continually stated \""I'll be right with you\"" again and again. At first, it was understandable, due to drive through orders, but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl, giggling. When she finally got to us at the register, she was rude and unprofessional, sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her. After we gave her our order, she didn't bother to recite it back, but instead, gave me the total, swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said, \""I need you to sign this.\"" $15/hr, eh? The food was great, but the service was insanely terrible and we will never go back."
"1","Don't come here for pizza. I looked at reviews to find a pizza place in Casa Grande to get a slice or personal pizza and thought that this place wouldn't be bad based on reviews. I was wrong.\n\nI ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza barely had any cheese on it in the first place, but neither the sausage nor the mushrooms were actually baked INTO the pizza. It was obvious that they had pre-made cheese slices that they warmed up on the stove top and just sprinkled the ingredients on. The crust was a decent thin crust, but the mushrooms were greasy and rubbery, the taste of the sausage was indescribable and gross (seriously, if you insist on getting pizza here, don't get the sausage)."
"2","We stopped in for dinner my husband had the Aah chi wa wa burger and a cup of the tortilla soup. He loved them both! I had a cup of the soup of the day, which was a wonderful cream of mushroom, and a half of chicken salad sandwich on a croissant. It was just yummy! We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer, really good but too much for two people not that we didn't eat them! \n\nI also took a piece of their carrot cake home, we had it today and it was good, not the best ever but 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nThe service is very friendly and attentive."
"1","I'd never eaten at a Cracker Barrel before so I can't comment if the food is so bad because of this location or just piss poor overall. \n\nThe cornbread was so bad I took one to go because we had the dog in the car and he wouldn't even eat it, it doesn't taste like there is any corn in it. Maybe if you add corn or just start using jiffy mix they would improve.\n\nMy oven fried chicken was pretty good - ill give them that. My Mac and cheese side would have been better if it was hot. Luke warm was the general theme of all of the sides - mashed potatoes were Luke too. The hashbrown casserole potatoes were still crunchy and undercooked which made it inedible. No one eats raw potato.\n\nHubby also had a tummy ache after eating here which scares me to think about the state of the kitchen. I will probably never eat at this chain again,"
"2","Good Chinese food at a reasonable price. Staff is friendly and service is great. Small dine in but always seems to have seats available. Our favorites: War Won ton Soup, Pork Fried Rice and Sesame Chicken. We go back often and have plenty of leftovers for the next day at home. Yum."
"1","Okay, this is hard for me, but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this. I have always been a fan of Big Wa. I have been eating here for five years, perhaps a bit longer. Today may keep me from going back. The food was great, always is, service was TERRIBLE. The server rushed us out as if our business was not important. Before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said \""Okay\"" and picked up our plates. To be fair, mine was empty, but my fiance and my 2 year old \ndaughters were not. That is totally unacceptable, and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time (around 20 minutes). To take my 2 year olds lunch without asking when we are spending $25 at your establishment is not acceptable."
"2","Hey it's Dairy Queen, what more is there to say? it's always clean"
"2","Nice restaurant for Casa Grande, somewhat pricey for the demographics but overall food is good and presentation is attractive! \nThe Cactus Garden and museum on premises is a must to view!\nFamily owned and operated with pride. Owner greets customers and is very cordial."
"1","Well it is a Denny's so I shouldn't be to critical. However, the place was dirty. Hair strands and food pieces on the booth and a dirty floor. Food was typical Denny's food. Service was decent and servers were very nice."
"1","I could not get my point across and felt horribly disrespected as a parent. I was asked inappropriate questions and was told to stop breastfeeding and to formula feed because his wife did and their kids are fine. In my opinion, no doctor should try to persuade a mother to stop breastfeeding, period. No doctor should question a mother who is making safe, healthy choices for their child.\n\n After hearing a two year old boys being circumsized in office, I went home and immediately started looking for a new pediatrician."
"2","I really love the pizza here. Service is hit or miss. My only complaint is the prices. They are way too high for casa.  We stopped going when they stopped the specials. If they cleaned the place up to make the atmosphere less divey, it might help also. Large Chad's special (14 inch pizza), a couple sodas, tax and tip is thirty bucks.\nGood pizza, but better get it to go..."
"1","I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now. But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ???? I left this dump. What a lousy way to start the day. Cocksuckers !!!"
"1","What happened to you Outback!? We have been frequenting you for years and the last several times we have been there - were very disappointing!  Food served cold, steaks not cooked to order, and one time we had a very rude Server, (female). Goodbye Outback."
"1","I am so done with outback steakhouse. We went there last night for a birthday dinner and we had so many issues everybody was upset about the meal. Ryan our waiter did not put the orders incorrectly, they had to remake a chicken salad which took forever to get back out to the table, my girlfriend's salad was not correct, they tried to fix it and made it worse. Ryan was very un-caring and the manager did not offer to make something else when the salad was bad the second time. This is the third time I've had issues with outback and we will not be back!"
"1","I usually go to Kathy's Alterations and she is great.  I usually don't buy dry clean only items, but I had a dress that needed to be dry cleaned.  Took it in and was told I needed to pre-pay, which was fine.  When I went to pick it up I was told they were unable to clean it due to a built in belt made of leather which they said could be ruined by the dry cleaning process. What I can't believe is that I wasn't issued a refund. I paid cash.  Not much, but I don't want \""credit\"" since I can't bring that item back and I don't wear clothes that I have to have dry cleaned.  The teenagers working there were not \""authorized\"" to do anything and the owner is \""out of town\"" and a manager is \""not available\"".  Learn to run a business. I am always able to call the owner for help at my job if there is a problem. I won't be back. I should have checked other reviews first."
"1","I tried their pizza on different occasions, different toppings but.... I just don't like it. It's tasteless and somewhat expensive. I always have to add either Parmesan cheese or garlic salt or even just salt! I like my pizza to have more flavor, some spice and Florencia's pizza was not that good."
"1","Just ordered delivery last night. I ordered a medium three topping pizza and a large calzone, which was $36. Way over priced! Then I opened the pizza box, only to see that the pizza was mostly globs of over bearing cheese. All cheese and hardly any toppings is a no go in my book. I just moved back to Chandler and I will never go back to this pizza joint."
"2","After looking around for good Chinese food in the area, we tried this place. We had it delivered and for $30 had enough food for two people for two nights!  The spicy dumplings are a must try. Different than other dumplings. The best hot and sour soup I have found in AZ. Beef lo mein was good. Moo Goo Gai was good. As was the sweet and sour shrimp. I think we have found put go to chinese take out."
"1","I am new to Phoenix and was looking for a really good Chinese place.  This menu showed up on my door and I thought what the hell...well that's what I said after dealing with poor customer service and a dish called \""Dragon and Phoenix\"".  This dish sounded good but had well over a whole onion and very little flavor.  The meat dumplings....mystery meat!  Definitely not potstickers.  The search continues, good luck on your visit to this place."
"2","Excellent food at great prices!"
"2","Pizza by the slice.. crust is crunchy and just right:) \n\nWe had a chance encounter with this place, by just driving by and decided to give it a whirl. Its a nice tiny eatery on the corner and it must be legit, because almost all the people ordering take-out and dining in were Italian.. We only tried the pizza by the slice, so cannot comment on anything else. \n\nGive it a try!"
"1","Not happy"
"1","Unfortunately I need to downgrade my rating. I still think the service is great. Very friendly. However, there are some big things I'm noticing when I go back that really bother me...\n\nIt's increasingly cluttered and dirty. And most of the nail polish looks old and rancid.\n\nI get a basic mani and pedi here, which was working fine for me. Each time they would try to upsell me to gel, and finally I gave in.\n\nSo at 3x the price for my normal manicure, they told me it would last for 3 weeks. Hardly. 4 days later, the polish on my thumbs were totally chipped and there were lots of air bubbles that popped up. Being that I had French, the bubbles look black on my nails. So I went back to have it fixed.\n\nThe girl did a really sloppy job. Polish is too thick. My polish is already peeling up and it's only been a week.\n\nI already knew that their products are old so I would bring my own nail polish. But now I'm irritated because I feel like I was talked into gel and it only lasted as long as my regular manicure because they are using crappy old product (high probability) and the gel was poorly applied (lack of skill).\n\nSo, if i need something basic done for cheap and fast, I'll still go here. But if I need a quality job done, I'm going to pay a little more and go somewhere else."
"1","I was in today and was cut by the callous removal tool on my ankle during a pedicure. It bled and stung and was not pretty. I was compensated by a 10% discount.(?) This is not how I would do business if I wanted to retain a brand new customer whom I just cut a chunk of skin off their ankle. Ouch! good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels. Horrible service!"
"2","This one is in Chandler mall.  Second floor above Wildflower Bakery.  One very nice thing about Lenscrafters is that they will adjust your glasses for you free.  Their frame selection is a little limited, but they do have some nice choices.  They accept several different insurances, or if you don't have insurance you can use AAA.  Plus they have specials from time to time.\n\nAnd they do stand behind their work.  If you have a problem within the first few weeks (90 days, I think), they will make it right.  Even if that means new lenses.\n\nWe usually come here for our glasses."
"2","I came to batteries plus after going to a couple of other stores that didn't have the batteries I needed. The batteries I needed were extremely small, smaller than hearing aid batteries, and they had little Japanese writing on them. When I went to Batteries Plus I walked up to the counter, and asked if they had these batteries. After waiting about 1 minute the gentleman emerged from their back room with the batteries I needed. I have never seen so many batteries in my life. For all of your battery needs, visit Batteries Plus!"
"1","I was unimpressed today with this do it yourself (DIY) car wash. \n\nIt was a nice touch having a credit card accepting swipper to go with that Quarter eating dial apparatus that starts at $1.75\n\nHowever the water pressure is low and the \""Spotless\"" setting is sadly all but ineffective.  In a hard water area like greater Phoenix, you would think they could get this right. \n\nReturn factor, zero.  Sorry."
"1","Basketball court is a serious safety hazard. I expect better up keep from a national brand as LA Fitness. The associates at the front desk are unprofessional and sloppy. Yes it's a gym but class is required in any establishment."
"1","I went to this place knowing that it was fast food mexican.  The food was just ok and I've tried it a few times. The people that work there are never nice and have never said Hi or thank you. I'm obviously not going there for the atmosphere but c'mon you could have some manners. \nThe last time I ate here the girl started mopping under my table that I was eating at and all of the others beside me. The smell of the floor cleaner was so overwhelming it got me sick. I did tell her not to mop near me but should I have to? I won't be eating here again. Even if the food was good it's not worth the attitude this place gives."
"2","Love them, great little hole in the wall ! Great tacos, nachos and burritos and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet. We prefer the one on Chandler Blvd. and Dobson in Chandler."
"2","I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo with beans and rice. The beans and rice were pretty standard. The cheese enchilada was quite cheesy and tasty. The beef taco was just OK, but that's partly my fault. I was expecting ground beef, but you have to specifically ask for it, so the next time I will go in I'll try that."
"1","Okay, here it goes...this may get long winded but I swear it is a truthful and honest review, so please read closely\n\nI lived at Lakeside (formerly known as Lakeside Village) for over 3 years, through 2013 and I saw the old management company Con AM get bought out by another management company called Madrona Ridge. Con Am wasn't the best, but things went downhill when madrona ridge took over.\n\nWhen I first moved here they were literally giving apartments away, they were offering less than $500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town, with a lake view, so it was a good deal. For the first 2 years there it was pretty solid, the managers knew my name, they cared about my problems and fixed anything I needed immediately, I'm talking same day service. They were nice people. Con AM and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the new management.\n\nAround the time Madrona Ridge took over things just got ratty. Loud and creepy people started moving in, bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them. Supposedly they have a no crime policy and won't rent to criminals, yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their DUI's and jail time. A lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night. I saw a drunk guy smash someone's windshield in a fit of rage and sped off, and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all. The landscapers didn't care to pick it up, the maintenance guys didn't care, so there it sat.\nMadrona Ridge promised all previous residents even better service than Con Am gave. I was wrapping up a lease when Madrona Ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal, so I stayed. But right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint. They hired the current girls who manage Lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show. \n\nThe current staff working here are probably the slowest, rudest, most impersonal women around. These girls Traci and Lucinda are NOT right for this job. They are NOT friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern, they are NOT accommodating or welcoming, no smiles, just a bland \""I don't care\"" attitude. If you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt. They also won't bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service, they'll just call you \""HEY\"" or \""You.\"" Also, if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they don't listen to their voicemails or return phone calls. \n\n I've had problems with bugs, repairs, questions, and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again. In the early days when I needed something fixed con-am would have it fixed in a day or two, these girls will make sure it takes over a week if you're lucky. So either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait, because as these managers know you aren't that important. Seriously...how hard is it to FAKE customer service? At least try to remember someone's name and care a little bit, a fake smile, anything helps, especially in a SALES position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar. FYI.\n\nI left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease, they offered me a new lease agreement that was ABSURD and overpriced. The one bedrooms here are 600 square feet, just tiny little run down apartments from the 1980's, and they are now asking $725.00+ per month...that doesn't include taxes, pet rent (if you have em) and utilities. So basically they are charging around $800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex, when you can go find a nice, NEW, cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month. Uhhh yeah, no thanks lakeside! I did just that and found a better, nicer, newer place for only pennies more than here. \n\n Do not believe the website, it is totally false advertised. What you see online is NOT what you will get in person. What you'll really see are outdated appliances from the 80's, peeling paint, popcorn ceilings, cheap carpeting, tiny closets, and no storage space. \n\nLakeside used to be a lot better, I used to love it at first and I'm grateful for the good times I had while it lasted. The management used to be nicer, the grounds used to be cleaner, and the prices used to be reasonable. This place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think it's a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down, ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag, and the service you get isn't worth a dollar. \n\nThe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time, there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby, but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value."
"1","sadly, i can't let my old review stand. i hope no one went there based on that review. idk what happened butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this last time was not good. \n\nthe beans on my friends plate looked like dried out play-do. it was really gross to look at from across the table, not gonna lie. and the lettuce on her plate was brown and wilty. i couldn't handle it.\n\n my food had this weird flavor and honestly....\n\neverything had a weird taste, even my diet coke.  we both agreed everything had a funny taste. idk what it was. i was sad bc last time my dinner was so amazing. i probably won't be going back for awhile. or ever, i haven't decided."
"1","For anyone who gives this place five stars-I seriously question your taste buds.  This is the Hometown Buffet of mexican food and it left both my friend and I feeling extremely ill.  If you want to spend a lot of money for canned food, then Valle Luna is perfect for you."
"2","I love their mexican pizza!  Happy hour in the cantina has great deals, half off appetizers and drink specials."
"1","We went with a group of 9 of us girls.  I requested a \""little\"" bit of sour cream on my tacos and they wanted to charge for a bowl. Really?  Who eats a bowl of sour cream on a taco? I also requested a few peppers and they too wanted to charge for a bowl of them.  My butt would be on fire the next am if I had a bowl if peppers and you want to charge me for the discomfort, good lord!!!...I requested to talk to management... His response was rude and advised me that even if I wanted a dab of sour cream or 1 slice of pepper they would charge for the bowl and to deal with it.  Total charge would have been 4.95.  I sent my entire plate back and said I guess I won't be paying for a dinner then or my margarita.  They could have made 20.00+ off me, but rather made zero.  The manager name is Usiel Molina.  He's rude and seriously should not be in customer service let alone management.  The others were not very pleased with the food.  The only thing this place has going is the patio environment."
"2","Happy hour is well worth it.   The service was good , my waiter kinda got lost in the crowd ( maybe he can crowd surf)."
"2","Red chille Carne is the best. Every Wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eat for 1.50. Such a great deal and it is very filling. The food is always fresh and hot when they sever you. Bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive, um I'm good. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion."
"1","I had a recent incident where 2 dress shirts I had brought in for cleaning were misplaced. Things happen yes, but it has been a bit of a nightmare dealing with the owner, Amish Amin, regarding compensation. Not only has this dragged on but his low-ball idea of a resolution is a $50 store credit for shirts that retailed at $85 each. I have been a patron for going on 8 yrs as I live around the corner, and easily spent ~$3000 in that time span. Despite this, Mr Amin's rude, unprofessional and outright unscrupulous way of conducting business has guaranteed that I will not be patronizing this business anymore and want to notify anyone of how 'fair-minded' this shyster is. As an entrepreneur myself, you make it right with the customer for lost/damaged property. THAT is good business.. I recently was there and witnessed him yelling disparagingly at a female patron regarding a purse damaged during a cleaning. Your money is good there until they have to take responsibility for damaging or misplacing your merchandise...and then the customer service turns nasty. Talk about bad business. To be fair, the staff at the Baseline store are good people; courteous, friendly and professional. Too bad that did not rub off on the owner who, in my opinion, lacks integrity and no longer deserves my business."
"1","The restaurant looks dirty and greasy inside.  All the side dishes looked like they had been sitting there for days.  The flavor of the food was good tho.  But the restaurant needs a makeover and a good cleaning"
"2","Awesome! One of the few small businesses that meet my expectations and then some. \n\nI am relatively new here and was looking for a groomer for my almost 100 pd. dog german shepard mix. He blows two coats ( top and undercoat) and it is impossible for me to keep up  when the weather changes even brushing daily.  Hair just falls off him in clumps  when he walks... that is the condition he was in... \n\nI called DDO and got a quick appointment at the time I wanted.  I asked for a bath/shedding treatment. They were friendly and professional at drop off.  Even though he is big, it only took two hours.  The best part was when I went to pick him up.  He was almost sleeping in the middle of the floor, no stress whats so ever.    And WHAT a job!!  He was super clean and ALL his lose hair was gone!  All at a price 30% less then what I have been charged else where for a so so or bad job. Other places have all this fancy \""treatment\"" stuff that doesn't do so great a job but cost an arm and leg .... \n\nIf you want groomer, you have to try this place. They are near the freeway so convent to most in the area. I will get him groomed more because the price is right and quality is high. You got to love it when businesses do what the say they will....... how refreshing.  Thanks Dog Days Out!"
"2","If you sign up for their rewards program you will get $$ back and 20% off coupon for ALL your shopping on special days so it's a pretty good deal.  This store is well stocked and clean."
"2","I've been 4 times, my sister was pregnant and the baby needed that Pho--Lucky me!\n\nBest Pho, ever.  \n\nBest spring rolls and the egg roll is served the right way--with lettuce to wrap around.  Also, fresh oil--not oil that's been around for 100 years--you know what i mean... *fresh*\n\nHuge, generous portions, fresh and authentic.  Gracious and hospitable service and the prices are insanely low.\n\nSo good that I'll drive to Chandler from South Scottsdale just for a taste.\n\nGo.  Now.\n\n-*- After reading a couple of reviews, I have to request that anyone please *not* dine here if you can't handle Vietnamese people eating next to you--I would hate for your bigotry to ruin the experience for anyone else.  In fact, you should probably not dine anywhere outside of your home if you're so consumed with hatred for anyone of a different ethnicity.  Thanks, much appreciated!  =) -*-"
"2","I've been to like 2 Vietnamese restaurants in my life, so I'm not an expert and can't compare this to anything else.  But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food.  I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the following:\n\nBeef Chow Fun - Yum.  Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.\n\nSpicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.\n\nFreshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.\n\nPork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say \""meh,\"" but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.\n\nAs everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.  Cold transparently wrapped bunches of tasteless lettuce... not so much."
"1","Update: Remember the friend thand had eaten the food with a fly? Well, today his wife just told me he has been going to the bathroom all day. I think he got food poison? They're going to be reported to the Department of Health, Chandler City, and BBB.\n\n--------\n\nWe always eat here when we crave Saigon Pho. Today was the last we eat here. Here's why .\n\nWe ate with 2 other families. One of the families got their order wrong. Instead of apologizing,  the server kept pointing at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered. Then, my friend found a dead fly in his food. Disappointed friend talked to another  server about it. You know what the server said instead of simply apologizing?  She said \""you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.\"" My friend's wife said that the fly was already under the food.  Server replied, \""no, no, no, no!\"" She should have just apoligized so they could have moved on. They even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly. My friends paid for it anyways. I could tell that they were trying to get rid of us. The other server gave our check even though we were still eating. He kept coming back for it thinking I would put my card on the bill. Later,  I see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table. We didn't accept it. My friend said the damage has been done. All they needed was an apology,  but instead, the rude server kept on with her attitude.  Finally, the couple asked for the number of their manager. Rude server was upset. These people need to learn about customer service and ethics. I never make reviews.  When I do, it's  something everyone has to know about."
"2","The food and value at Saigon, bar none is a 10 for me.  I love the sliced beef pho #12 which I must order with an order of spring rolls.  The soup is always hot and fast with fresh sprouts, lime, and basil.  As for the spring rolls, well I have an addiction to these fried egg rolls wrapped in romaine lettuce and mint.  On occasion I will splurge and order a fresh drip ice coffee--a nice finish to a good meal.  \n\nThe service is swift and mildly courteous which is fine by me only because the food is exceptional!"
"2","Fastest service ever! I love getting breakfast here because I know it will never make me late! The employees are so friendly, too!\n\nDuring once visit, I had been dieting for a while and decided to treat myself to some fries but they were less than warm. Any other time and I would have eaten them, but I had been craving them so bad!! They happily made me some fresh fries and chatted with me while I waited! It made my day ;)"
"2","Always a bargain to be found"
"1","Very disappointed by this place. Maintenance and upkeep on a minimal scale. Faulty wiring, drafty windows, missing screws, doors that fall off the hinges, leaky toilets, insects, windows that don't close all the way, deteriorating stairwells, no doorbells....there are SO many other properties in this area that render this place useless. My advice is to drive around the corner or even across the street or a few blocks down.  It is obvious that the renter is simply a statistic here."
"2","I love this place. They have delicious pizza, pasta, and beer.  I don't know what they put in their pizza muffins, but the thi"
"2","The BF and I went here tonight and it was AWESOME!!! This place is a cute little family restaurant that has comforting food for extremely inexpensive. We shared an individual salad, which was fresh and had an abundance of cucumbers and tomatoes...also, the house italian dressing was very tasty. We got an order of breadsticks, which were good, nothing wonderful, but something I would get again. Then we shared a calzone with pepperoni and ricotta cheese that was very good. The calzone crust was golden and delicious and the sauce was also very good. But you wanna know the best part? Our very filling dinner cost 12$. That's right. 12$. That is crazy ridiculous! We will definitely be back here... this may be our new go to pizza place, so hooray for that!"
"2","I really like this place. The food is consistent and high quality, and the prices and service are excellent. They are often busy and the actual restaurant decor, etc. is nothing special, but you are there for the food, right?"
"1","I had the regular spaghetti with marinara and meatballs. And the meatballs were good with the sauce but the sauce alone with the noodles was HORRIBLE the marinara sauce tasted like packaged ketchup from in n out! If I were you I would just order the Alfredo like this old man was raving about in the restaurant or have the famous baked spaghetti but I've had way better! I'm never going there again customers were giving me weird looks... So overall my experience at this restaurant was uncomfortable and the food tasted like a frozen meal cooked in a microwave! Do not eat here!!!! I'd rather eat a gas station mexican breakfast burrito"
"1","When I noticed my kitty starting to constantly, vigorously scratch her head, especially around her eye, I made an appointment for here.  Went to the appointment and waited for almost 3 hours before seeing anyone. Hearing all the dogs barking for that long terrified her that much more.  Then I finally got in waited some more, saw the vet assistant for only a couple minutes and again waited almost another hour before finally seeing the actual vet.\nNo apologies for waiting all afternoon, no sympathy or compassion shown for a sick kitty.  Felt like I just took my car in to the repair shop.  She was examined, had tests run and the vet comes back and says Chloe (my cat) has ear mites.  I asked how thats possible.  She lives in a clean house, never goes outside, my other cat is fine.  The response was \""I dont know, but she has mites\"".   3 different meds were prescribed and follow up was scheduled.   At the follow up, we saw a different vet who treated her better.  He explained everything to me, including pricing. I again asked about the ear mites.  He looked at her file and said she never had ear mites!  She just had a deep ear infection.\nHere's the kicker.  The first time she was brought in, she was so scared she had a little \""accident\"" in her kennel.  I grabbed some tissues and immediately cleaned it up.  I asked the assistant where a garbage can was, she took the tissues from me and threw it out and then charged me a \""medical waste disposal fee\"" of $4!  \nOverall, I would only recommend taking your pet there for something simple like getting shots updated or something very minor.  I want a vet who is going to get to know my pets and treat them more like a patient.  I won't be going back there."
"2","Pesto's rocks the kazbah! It is a hot little spot in an armpit of a strip mall.  The wine bar is movin' and shakin' almost every night of the week. Forget, 98South, 56East, if you want to chat with a bunch of fun people about absolutely anything with a staff that is there to cater to your every wine desire, well, Pestos is great. \n\nThe wine list is a treat to drink yourself through and should be on someone's - maybe mine - top 75 things to do list! As lovely as the wine list is, what truly is the cherry on this sweet slice are the bartenders. They are not shy about a generous pour, love a long chat about absolutely nothing and know absolutely everything about the wine they serve and love to share. What is not to like about this establishment....well, the food is just okay. Hey, its' Chandler. Wadda ya want? The pizza crust has  improved recently and well, the appetizers have never been anything to right home about.  Does the food detract, yes but just a little bit, hit the bar, serve yourself up a flight and turn to your neighbor and start chatting!"
"2","After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)"
"2","This place totally surprised me. The staff was warm and friendly and the food was both unique and very fresh. The  gnocchi was excellent. They even had a kids menu although they seem to cater more toward adults."
"2","Lovely family own restaurant. A true neighborhood gem.\n\nAwesome service and really comfortable.\n\nThey have more high tops than regular tables so be aware if you go with kids our elder people.\n\nI tried the calamari, cauliflower, custom pizza, pineapple Canadian bacon pizza and the lasagna. Very solid and well presented dishes. \n\nBe aware, servings are big.\n\nFit desert I had the chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream. There was no hot chocolate filling :'( the I've cream was delicious though.\n\nHighly recommended and we'll be back and try other dishes (beet salad for sure).\n\nSo the missing star is because there's room for improvement. Which for them will be really easy to do.\n\nPrices are fair.\n\nCheers"
"1","If you want to be yelled out and called a liar, go to RSVP realty.  A few months into a rental agreement, the A/C went out during a heat wave in August.  RSVP told us to stay in a hotel and they would reimburse us for up to $75.  A few weeks after we submitted our receipts for two days, we received a letter stating that the tenants were responsible for the motor breaking and attached the $700 bill!  And the hotel would not be covered.  When my roommate and I spoke to RSVP, we were told that we were to blame because the filter was not replaced.  We communicated that the filter was replaced last month and he told us we were lying.   He not only backed out on his commitment to fix the repair and reimburse us for the hotel, but blamed us for the old air conditioner going out on a hot AZ summer day.  I am not only completely appalled by the shady company, but appalled by the lack of professionalism in yelling at us calling us liars and that the landlord wants to evict us.    When talking to the owner of the home, she profusely apologized for RSVPs unprofessional behavior and lies.   I will never use RSVP realty for ANY business and will share this story with people."
"1","I have been going to All American Eyeglass Repair for several years. I always change out nose pads on my sunglasses to silicone nonslip pads. They cost around $30 depending on type of frames. They normally have friendly and knowledgeable staffs there and never had any problems before. I even recommended to friends and co-workers. Last time I was there, there was this crazy old witch there and she was so rude and made a big deal about adjusting my glasses. She said she had to charge me $15 to adjust my sunglasses because they weren't purchased there. WHAT?!?! I've been taking all of my glasses there for repairs and never had any problems with free fitting. When they replaced the nose pads, the staff always adjust to make sure they fit properly. The guy that worked on my glasses told me to wear for a day and see how they fit and bring back for readjustment if needed. This crazy lady (I believe she's the owner) tried to charge me a fee. I had to argue with her till she finally agree to adjust at no charge. She was freakin nuts! Every eyeglass place I've ever been always adjust at no charge even though I did not purchase them there. I will not give them any more business and will not be going back."
"1","Don't ever buy the HD and B&J ice cream there. It was so expensive if compare to Traget. Not going back for sure."
"1","I feel bad 'cause I know this is a local owned business, it's close to me and I believe has been here since I moved here in '94. Used to be the only store and I never had a problem with it. The employees are great!  Not sure if more selection has raised my awareness or if this place has just degraded in what it offers.\n\nPrices vary - all the markets play their games, price this low to get people in, mark other things up to make the profit. But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre. I have shopped AJ's and it appears Eddie Basha is sending all the good stuff there and placing the leftovers here. Never a great selection, overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here.\n\nHope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if I'm in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles."
"2","best Mediterranean food in the valley,  love the open kitchen layout, it makes for a great show on a Friday or Saturday night, the live jazz on Thursdays and Saturdays makes it worth the trip from central phoenix for me.  i got hooked at the location in Tempe when i was going to school, Samir was running it then( one of the greatest chefs in the southwest) they still use many of his recipes and maintain his style.  they have a few locations all over the valley. Chandler, with the pond, the patio, and the interior layout w/ live music this is with out a doubt their best location, ask your server for the details on the dishes it will make your decision a lot easier, great wine list too and again allow your server to guide you in the right direction.  healthy fresh food, great prices, great service, creative atmosphere."
"1","\""Let's meet at the Chandler Pita Jungle!\"" texts fiddle r dee. \""What's it near? Like the mall proper?\"" I text back. \""Dobson and Ray!\"" she exclaims (she's easily excitable it's pretty cute the first hundred thousand times but after that it's like wha'ev's :p) \""What the hell!?! That's not near the mall!!!\"" I shout in my mind. I had no idea that there was anything else in Chandler besides that obnoxious mall, an In-n-Out Burger, and were all the house wives whose husbands aren't wealthy enough to give them houses in Scottsdale lived. I couldn't believe it. Amazing. \n\nSo I park the chrome trimmed tank and burst through the doors looking for the fiddle r and a bunch of friggin' ducks that she has been eyeballing for lunch. She urged me several times in class via text to hurry because raw duck gives her indigestion and she didn't think the proprietors would look favorably upon her preparing her own lunch on the patio (unlike the Monastery). She was ravenous and there's a fierceness that comes out when she gets that way. It would be scary if it didn't makes me giggle. Anywhodunnit, yah, a friggin' patio and with friggin' ducks! I love friggin' ducks! Oh yah, around noon this place is filled with soccer moms mostly minus their spawn but a couple of the moms stole them away from their nannies long enough to show the brats off to the other soccer moms. I imagine the conversations go a little like this, \""Look how much more better and how much more pretty my baby, I forget its name, is than your baby that you forgot its name is.\"" \""oh yah, but at least my husband, I forget his name, bought me better tits than your husband, you forget his name, did.\"" and then they go runnin' for the shelter of their mothers' little helper... I think this is why I wasn't really noticed when I first walked in and asked about the ducks I look nothing like these people, my soul had not been crushed by the fact that I sold my dreams for a cookie cutter cardboard existence (mostly because I sold my soul in 4th grade, a long time ago).\n\nI finally found fiddle r at her table on the patio and exchanged glares I sat to wait another ten minutes until someone asked us if we needed help. Luckily for the staff the conversation was fairly good otherwise the fork that Ms. fiddle r was fiddling (she's an amazing fiddler) with would have ended up in someone's temple a couple of times.\n\nWhen we finally received a bit of wait attention nothing on the menu jumped out at me. I was thinking lamb or pork gyro. Sad face for Howard, beef gyro for me. Fiddle r ordered the Lavosh Shwarma wrap that read like it might be the good side of yummy but I didn't want to order the same thing because I wanted to be different.\n\nI've been to one other Pita Jungle (across from MCC in Mesa on Southern) three times in total but have never been overly impressed by them but seemed fairly competent. This one fell inline with it's sister store even with the strange beef in the gyro that I think they try to make look like lamb but in rectangular slices. WHERE IS THE FRIGGIN' LAMB!?! The exception as far as the food is concerned was the Blue Corn Nachos that fiddle r ordered for us. Someone in the kitchen dumped a bucket of goodness onto a plate and slathered it with cheesy gooey-ness! Yum! Fiddle r and I enjoyed it muchly as did the ducks. And actually ducks like a lot of things I wouldn't have thought like tomatoes, beans, beef, and chicken. I wished they served duck because that would have been hilarious.\n\nWhat made this place fun was not the food (2.25-2.5 stars - I changed my mind.) and definitely not the service we received (2 stars, I wasn't even asked if I wanted another beer) it was the shaded friggin' patio located on the edge of a man-made lake-ish type water feature and the friggin' ducks and as always the friggin' company."
"2","I would say that I prefer the Mesa location simply because it tends to be quieter but this one is within walking distance for me so it's often the one I go to.  Plus I like sitting out out by the lake when the temperature finally becomes reasonable.\n\nI was reading the previous reviews and a lot of people have had problems with the service but I've never had anything but wonderful service here.  I've eaten here during busy and slow times and the service has always been pretty consistant.  The food is excellent and, I think, appropriately priced.  I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare.   I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.  I do eat fish occasionally so my only sadness is that they stopped carrying the Tuna Melt Pizza which was to die for.  Maybe they'll bring it back someday.......can you hear me Pita Jungle?"
"1","Walked in to the sight of the hostess and all the wait staff texting on their phones. Bartender said we could seat ourselves. Waited for about 15 minutes- didn't even get waters. There was more staff on hand than patrons, so there was no reason for any kind of wait. Poor service, total lack of professionalism... Went to the Mexican grill next door and had drinks in less than 3 minutes. I suggest going there instead!"
"2","Customer service is always an A+! My husband and I come in a lot! They have our drink order down as well as our food order!! Super friendly and they always cater to our needs! We love this pita jungle!!"
"2","The salads here are absolutely delicious and there is so many choices to choose from! The service was so nice and I enjoyed that the hosts and servers were all wearing their normal attire. The building was so unique and I loved the decor in the place. \n\nI got the Greek Salad, I highly recommend it!"
"1","This place is located conveniently close to me, so I had to stop by for a weekend breakfast. The decor is classic 50s diner, so I really  wanted to like this place but I came away disappointed. The service was fine, the food looked delicious, but ultimately everything I tried was bland and forgettable.\n\nSometimes I am hesitant to trust my first impression of a restaurant's food... as if my taste buds might be having an off day. However, I went with a friend who is potentially the world expert on biscuits & gravy. Absolutely every breakfast joint he dines at, he samples their biscuits and gravy (in addition to the regular breakfast). Biscuits + white sausage gravy should = delicous. Not here. It must've been made from a mix.\n\nSorry to say I didn't enjoy my dining experience here. The food filled the void but had no flavor."
"2","I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase's Diner today. Good food as well as good fries. This is one of those 50's style diners that's fun to eat at. I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated,\nAll Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy. \nHilarious."
"2","Went here for a quick weekday breakfast while running errands.  \nStaff= friendly. \nService= quick & pleasant. \nFood= better than expected. French Dip, Standard Cheeseburger and Green Chile cheeseburger all delivered.  \nPlace could use an update and even a good cleaning on the windows and walls but it wasn't gross or anything."
"1","If I could give a zero stars, I would.  Got Meatloaf dinner and Chicken Fried Steak tonight.  One piece of the meatloaf was literally burned black on one side and had the stripes from the grille.  The Chicken Fried Steak was hard as a rock.  The coating was like a dead carcass and it just peeled off the meat in one piece.  The meat inside could not have been chewed by a dinosaur!  I don't recommend Chase's to anyone who wants quality food.  They need some new people in their kitchen.  The owner was very nice, however, and offered us a free meal.  Which we declined.  We had this happen to us once a while back and swore we wouldn't go back that time.  This time........never again no matter how much free food they offered!"
"2","The staff here and the PTs are excellent! I have been seeing them since 2009 and this year, despite multiple injuries and a very rigorous training schedule, they managed to keep me healthy enough to complete an Ironman race. They are wonderful for injury management and prevention and for rehab after surgery or other injury. I absolutely love this place and they are truly a part of my regular training and fitness to keep me in top competition shape."
"1","This place is a disaster. Stopped for lunch right at noon. The entire staff was in the back while the line kept building. Five minutes before anyone came out. The food was mediocre and the staff was very disorganized. Appeared to me that some definite training is in order."
"1","This location really gives bagel places a bad name. \n\n\nI don't know why I continue to keep trying and going back to this establishment. Probably because it is right across the street from work.\n\nNo matter what I order a bagel with cream cheese or a egg and cheese on a bagel it just takes forever.\n\nThis morning I literally walked out when I was online. They had about 6 people waiting to order for over 10 minutes!\n\nSecondly, I don't love their food that takes 6 hours to make. that is being handled by ex cons working there and people who do not care about their \n\nI am not going back. I mean it this time. For real I will be going to chompies which is a mile away and get better, faster, and product."
"1","My family and I ate here for our grandfathers birthday. Figured we could try it since he loves steakhouses. We made a reservation but it really wasn't needed...this place was not busy at all, especially for 630pm on a Saturday night. \nFirst we got off on the wrong foot because we asked to be seated at a larger table (6 people and 1 baby). The hostess said no because they save it for large groups (it had 8 chairs). \nOk everything was fine after but the food took forever! The margarita I ordered was poorly made. We did accidentally spilt a glass of water and they brought napkins promptly. But after cleaning up the water with the white napkin I realized the table was discustingly dirty...like black dirty. \n\nThe food was not that bad but the chicken from the kids meal kind of tasted like there was a hint of metal. Yeah it was gross...like McDonald's chicken is better.\n\nProbably won't return. Even with a good coupon this place was not worth it. \n\nCmon black Angus step it up!"
"2","The molasses bread here is to die for as well a the fried zucchini.  While the happy hour selection is limited, the dishes are great!"
"1","I don't think my fianc\u00e9 or I will ever return to a Black Angus. We don't go out often...so when we want to do something special on the weekends we want to skip the dishes end enjoy some fine cuisine and have a pleasurable evening together. However...our last experience was anything but.\n\nWe went to the Black Angus located in Chandler, Arizona on March 8th (so 2 and a half weeks ago from this point). It It seemed like a normal enough place and we were shown to our table. One of the first things we noticed, and my fianc\u00e9 asked about, was if the place used to be an IHOP...as the tables seemed to have that kind of quality to them.\n\nOur waitress Emily arrived, gave us our menus, and asked us what we'd like to drink. As we usually do we ordered lemonades. Emily said that they had strawberry-raspberry lemonades and, thinking this was just a flavor, we said sure. She promptly returned with our lemonades and, I will admit, we were pleasantly surprised. We just expected it to be a reddish colored drink but this had real fruit in it. So being as thirsty as I was (there was no water on the table up to this point) I downed mine in a quick fashion and asked for a refill. She then said she'd bring me back a water with the lemonade because they were $2.99 a refill. We were shocked. We just wanted lemonade period. We didn't know we'd ordered SPECIAL lemonades that were three dollar a drink. We reluctantly allowed her to get another one because we didn't know if there were any NORMAL lemonades at this point...since, after all, that's what we thought we asked for. We looked at the menu, which to me was horribly overpriced, and I asked my fianc\u00e9 if she was SURE this is where we wanted to eat. Since she was just trying to go with the flow of it she said it'd be fine and that it wasn't a big deal. If only...\n\nWe ordered the 2 for $54 meal deal that offered an appetizer, 2 sides per meal, and then the entree per each person. We got our sampler and were not impressed. It was okay but I've had the same kind of thing at Applebee's and other restaurants.\n\nWhen we finally got our meals...well...that's when things started to go from bad to worse. One of the things I noticed when I ordered my meal, which was a disappointment, was that the biggest sized steak available in this meal deal was a 12 oz new york or ribeye. Not what I'd call large by any means. When I looked at my steak, and began to cut it up, I managed to trim off about 20% of it in fat alone, and the portions of the sides were on the small side. My fianc\u00e9's meal was not much better. The grated parmesan looked and tasted odd and somehow, to her utter amazement, they managed to screw up the green beans somehow. Even two weeks later, when we mention all this to people, she still can't understand how someone can fail to cook green beans in such a way that they taste horrible. The food, overall, was of average quality and not what we'd expect from a place like Black Angus.\n\nOur waitress made a guest appearance once or twice (with the second time being to deliver the slice of cheesecake to top off our meal) so we were left wondering half the time if we had a waitress at all.\n\nFinally we elected to tip the waitress 15% of our bill since some of the problems were not hers and we didn't want her to have a bad evening which might boil over into someone else's bad meal experience. This took our total bill of $68.70 up to a bit over $79. \n\nWe were not thrilled with our visit to the establishment, as you can see. So we decided we'd go home and leave a comment on the website listed at the bottom of the receipt, like most restaurants have. When I put in the website I was confused: why is it asking what my opinions are on various combo ideas when I had a bad experience. I discovered this was the entire purpose of the website. I had to actually go to the Black Angus website and merely leave a comment.\n\nAt this point we were fairly content to leave it at that, now that we gave some feedback, but the manager of the restaurant, Matt, decided to contact us to discuss what happened and see what he could do to make it right. I told him I didn't believe it was his or Emily's fault about the prices, as they are decided by someone higher up in the food chain (no pun intended), but it would have been nice to have been informed about the refill price on these special lemonades, larger portion sizes, and for the staff to be a bit more attentive (it's odd having to share a water at a place where it averages $30 a person). I always believe in second chances but my fianc\u00e8 was a bit harder to convince I succeeded, as Matt offered to send us a gift card. \n\nOver a week passed by and nothing showed up in the mail. I actually had to contact Matt to find out what was going on and if one was sent at all. He said he'd forgotten it in his car but it would show up soon. Okay...that's fine. Things happen. Then it showed up today. A $20 gift card. We found it insulting. I don't know what we expected but not this."
"2","I have frequented this place quite a few times, and its okay.  The things I like about it are the late hours, \""free\"" internet as long as you buy a drink and the indoor and outdoor seating.\n\nWhat I don't like is how they now regulate the internet.  When you purchase a drink, they give you a reciept for only 3 hours worth of internet service.  It's not that I personally need more then 3 hours of service at one time, but why regulate the Wifi?  Maybe its to stop people from camping out and hogging up space or something, I'm not sure.\n\nThe staff has always been nice to me, but I'm only there on average about once a month at best, and its usually to take advantage of thier late hours."
"1","I've been to CR a few times now since I like to venture out of my usual latte spots... usually a decent experience... This time, however, I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place (and ultimately alter my desire to come back again).  \n\nThis particular evening, my sister and I arrived and, though we weren't planning on staying and hanging out (I just wanted a latte), after what we experienced, we decided to leave quickly.  \n\nThe place has a nice, local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people, in groups, or on laptops, just chillin' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all, too.  When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \""yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\"" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking \""really??? are you serious??\"" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF!\nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway... \n\nTHEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?.. I found that annoying and definitely a con to getting lattes at this place.\n\nall in all, I'm not sure I'll come back soon.. maybe not for a while.. or ever.  Sorry, but I've experienced better."
"2","I am addicted to coffee. I know, it's a problem! :D Buuut I wouldn't say I'm an expert. So excuse my own way of describing what I like and don't like. \n\nThe coffee here is the perfect \""strongness\"". The taste is perfect for me, strong enough without being bitter and gross. They have a great variety of espresso drinks like mochas, black and whites, mint, etc. All really good. The baristas have quite the showmanship. They are quick, precise, and do some cool tricks as well! \n\nThe atmosphere is okay. Fine to study but not exactly cozy to hang out. There is free wifi which is a plus."
"1","Yangste Chinese bistro will be truly missed. Really you guys. The new place will not ever compare. Beware that the new place needs lots of work to be able to compare to the lagacy yangste had built"
"1","Ok so I guess I'm the odd one out here. The service was great the happy hour deal with imported beers for $2.50 was excellent but the food was just average. Well the chips were ok with the salsas, beans and sour cream but both of our meais were disappointing. It almost tasted like the food was premade and then heated up though I wouldn't accuse them of this it just sort of tasted that way. I had the veggie combo - the chile releno was mostly breading and kind of bland, the enchilada was decent but nothing that made it stand out and the taco was almost all lettuce with some beans but not much flavor.  They do charge for extra chips but to me for two people that's not a big deal since the portions are more than enough with one basket of chips. I will give it a second shot since everyone here says it's very good."
"1","Since this place is close to home and I love Mexican food, I've tried very hard to like Si Senor's over the years.  Still \""not feeling it.\"". The service is always good, ditto for the chips and salsa but the entrees fall short on taste. I know New Mexican style food and this isnt it."
"1","Not the same as I remember since I moved. It not worth the money . I just wanted to know if it is the same as I remember. There no heart or passion in the food. For new Mexico food,  visit the state of New Mexico for the food."
"2","I come here for one thing...\n\n\nThe grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.  \nBelieve me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.\n\nHorchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story."
"1","Lets face it, no one wants to write a review about her vagina getting checked (TMI anyone?) but as women we need to find places we can rely and trust for all our Gyno needs. This is just my small contribution to it.\n\nI was in a situation where I needed to see a specialist and I didn't know of any in the area. My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test).  I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr.\n\nThe office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my ID/insurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?. I quickly lifted up my pants and ran to the desk to try and convince them to let me give my urine sample right away, before I exploded.\n\nI gave my sample but was really grossed out that they gave me a coffee-looking paper cup. Below those cups they actually had the plastic sample containers with a lid, but they insisted I use the regular paper (NO LID) cup and put it in the deposit box. Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor. When he finally arrived, the procedure literally took 2 mins and I was out the door by then. Not sure why I had to wait 1.5hrs for that but oh well.\n\nI didn't feel like the office was very organized or patient-focused. It bothered me that all consultation rooms had flat screen TVs with drug advertisements, to try and entice you to ask your doctor about that. It gives me the impression that they are in the business of selling unnecessary medication and ad space rather than patient care. No, I don't wan to discus how I can gulf down a bunch of pills so that my period smells like flowers and unicorns. I just want to be healthy.\n\nWait.. is that too much to ask?"
"1","Avoid on weekdays if you want Dim Sum!\n\nThe last two times I went there I left after sitting at a table for 20 minutes with no food. Sometimes a cart would go by - a different table.  \n\nNo amount of hand waving or imploring looks would do any good.\n\nYou couldn't drag me in there kicking and screaming on a weekday again."
"2","Went here today for Dim Sum with a friend and we were very happy. The food was excellent and the service very friendly and attentive. We picked several items from the carts and all of them were very good.  I remember having sticky rice, chow mein, three different kind of dumplings with shrimp, Chinese broccoli, and fried egg rolls. Everything was fresh and very good. I was tempted to try a couple more things but already had more than I could eat. My date was very happy with the food and complimented the staff for being very friendly."
"2","Besides all the typical reasons that I can find all the Asian goodies and fresh seafood, it's really an INTERNATIONAL market.  I travel out of country every year, so I make a point to hit the aisles beforehand so I know what I don't have to bring back... Being a crazy food collector, I need to save some baggage space for non-perishable souvenirs.  \n\nI'm seriously tempted to take digital pictures of the food aisle representing the country I go to next... we brought back a few brands of yerba mate from Buenos Aires... taking away precious space from their version of dulce de leche... Lee Lee's had every brand of that funky drink at home!"
"2","Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket is an adventure in itself!  If you are looking for a specific item, you will find it here!  If you aren't looking for anything specific, you'll find it here!  Fresh Quail and Duck eggs, squid, live fish, fruits and vegetables that are exciting and fresh, tofu noodles, mixes, sauces and so much more!!\n\nOur kids love the fish market, yes you can smell it is a fish market as soon as you walk in the door!  The staff is great too, one of the fish mongers even surprised our kids by giving life to a mackerel.  Giving new meaning to the term \""Holy Mackerel!\""  I'm not sure who jumped higher, the kids or the fish monger from the shrieks from our kids!\n\nAfter about and hour of just perusing the aisles, we decided to shop.  We filled our basket with delectable adventurous, for us, items and headed out.\n\nMake sure you have some time to spare before going shopping at Lee Lee's, you sure don't want to miss a great item for being in a rush!"
"1","I've been shopping here for many years and this is a serious downgrade.  It could be me but the last few times I've been here, the items I'm used to buying they no longer carry.  Plus, prices seem more expensive.  \nThe most disappointing part is their customer service.  It used to be when I couldn't find an item and would ask for help, someone would go out of their way to help me and make sure I found what I was looking for.\nThe last few times, I first encountered employees who looked unhappy and harassed when I asked for help.  This last time, the young man that helped me looked surly.  Like he didn't like me and I'm his costumer!  He showed me a gas stove to be used for hot pot, it was the last one and the case was broken.  He glossed over this fact hoping I wouldn't notice.  When I pointed out to him the case was broken, he very unkindly told me that may be the case but nothing is wrong with the gas stove itself.\n*Sigh* I'll probably still shop here as there are not very many options for Asian grocery stores here in Phoenix but I won't be walking in and out of there with a smile like I used to!"
"2","My second heaven!\nI glided inside the way Chandler and Joey glided into Monica and Rachel's apartment except no porcelain dog was involved.\n\nI went straight to the aisle where I can stock up on my cans of Dace in salted black beans. Bought $35 worth. Then skipped around to the baker ... mmmm curry beef pastry and cream-filled pastry. Went to the back and picked out some fish for the deep fryer. Then over to the noodle section to stock up.\n\nI am a happy camper. Cooked so much Asian food while in Chandler, that getting an In-and-Out burger while on my way back up the mountain, my usual ritual, just seemed unfathomable. Why ruin all this good food inside of me with fast food.\n\nLove love love Lee Lee Market!!"
"1","Sad!! The talent and creativity of their sushi chefs is unfortunately trumped by the horrific customer service due to lousy wait staff. The rolls here are creative, fresh, funky (sometimes too funky, i've had a weird choice or two that i would not choose again) and overall pretty good. But if their paying customers continue to be neglected during their visits they will inevitably fall due to low scoring reviews. My review score is based solely on the horrible service provided by their waitress last week."
"1","I always like to try new restaurant. After reading Yelp with some mixed reviews, I went on and bought a Groupon $25 for $50 deal and thought it was a good deal. It was my bf and I first time at Ninja's. The place was empty, we were greeted by a very sweet waitress. The first thing I noticed was the chefs. I thought, well it's ok, not all Sushi restaurants have to have Japanese chefs to make it good. Does that make me a Sushi snob? : / The first thing our waitress ask if we have a Groupon. Why? Does that matter, I thought. I said yes and she gave us the menu. We look at it but nothing sounds appetizing. Is it a different menu cause we have a Groupon? We decided to order a lot just in case... I think I've ordered about 10 rolls, sushi, and sashimi, But when our food arrived, it didn't seem enough. Our waiter didn't tell us what was on the first plate. Then the second round, he just drop it off on our table and we have no idea what we'd got. The rolls were just medico, nothing fancy or tasty. I thought they were all bland. Felt like the foods were made from Sushi 101 cookbook. My bf loves sushi and can sit forever eating them, but by the third plate, he said he was done and wanted to get the rest home. I was very surprised when the bill came, it was over $100 without drinks. I gave our waiter our Groupon and it came down to $65. I felt like we were gypped cause I don't think we recieved all the food we've ordered. I look at the order sheet and some wasn't cross off. And we weren't even stuffed ( it doesn't take a lot for me ) Also, we have very little leftover. I would have check with our waiter but my bf didn't care for the rest of the food. He didn't enjoy them anyway. So when I thought about it all, I spent way more than I wanted too, just to try a new place and leftover I don't think neither of us would eat again. This is one reason why my bf don't like to sway away from our favorite place. With that, the amount  we spent we could have gone to our favorite place twice, that's what he said! :)\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back. But if you're not a sushi snob and for $20 all you can eat sushi, this place might be for you."
"2","This place is too popular on Sunday for breakfast.. Which is coincidentally when I like to go too. We normally wait in line for a half hour but I think its worth it. Good food. Decent prices."
"2","I just took my wife and daughter to Mimi's. If you like REAL New England clam chowder then look no further than this place. They only serve it (sniff) on Fridays. It is rich, creamy, and full of big chunks of fresh clams. Couple that with a full menu of great lunchtime or dinnertime treats and you'll come away satisfied. The service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints. My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was. The food, the service, and the ambience is great. Two thumbs up...way up!"
"2","I had never been to Mimi's Cafe before I joined my networking group. (Chandler Networking Professionals every Tuesday at 12 just in case you were wondering). The staff here is very accommodating. The food is always hot and fresh. Lately I have been getting a chicken Caesar salad with blackened chicken. It also comes with a muffin of your choice. Other favorites menu items of mine are the BBLT and the Le burger de Madame. It's a bacon cheese burger with a fried egg.  Stop by if you're looking for a good lunch. Also if you're looking for a place to host an event or group meeting they have a huge secluded room that could accommodate you."
"1","Noticed a few reviews complaining about cold French onion soup so I brought that up with the Waiter he assured me it would be hot so I tried it off course it came out cold.  Didnt think the flavor was to good.  Ordered chicken salad  sandwich and it was whole wheet croissant. Why would some want a healthy croissant that makes no sense and why would the menu not explain that."
"2","As Jesse J. said we went here last night for some sushi after i had looked here on Yelp and man was it worth it. So far this is probably the best sushi I have had in Arizona.\n\nMy favorite roll was the big and spicy roll. The flavor was just amazing with the seared salmon and yellowtail(?) on top with the pickled jaleneno. The sauce on it was amazing as well this is one where no soy sauce is needed.\n\nAlso ordered a spicy tuna but asked him to go a little on the spicy side and he obliged and it was a nice fiery roll but not so much that the taste of the tuna got lost. It but some burning on my tounge but was amazing.\n\nThe rest of the meal was jut as good especially the tsunami roll which I can best describe as a vegas roll minus the cream cheese(i am no a fan of cream cheese in sushi) with it's own special sauce. The sauce was a great mix of hot and sweet where you got a bit of a kick but it was cooled quickly. Even people who don't do spice will like this.\n\nThe only things preventing this from being a 5 star place was that i never got the water i ordered and some of my miso soup was cold, i think the tofu had not been in long enough. A return visit is planned soon and could easily up this to 5 stars."
"2","The best sushi in Chandler. Possibly in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nShimogamo is a quiet sushi location in a strip mall.  The interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.  Hurry is not the name of the game here; bring a friend that you really like and have some great conversation while you enjoy the easy going but very pleasant service.\n\nYou won't taste ice on your fish here and it's one of the few places I feel comfortable eating sushi in the desert."
"2","The best sashimi in the valley.  I like the relaxed atmosphere here and not feel rushed to complete my meal.  Best make reservations if you plan on a weekend night out.  Better yet, get there when they open and enjoy happy hour beer pricing."
"2","I liked it here! The food was pretty great.\n\nI ordered the cucumber roll, veggie roll, and eel/cucumber roll. I love my cucumber, obviously! The rolls were a little small but they were tasty. I wish the rice had a little more seasoning, but it was definitely not bad at all!\n\nI also ordered  the sunomono salad, which had shredded crab meat in it as well as some seaweed. It was very yummy but maybe a little too much vinegar. No big deal!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the shrimp tempura, calamari and chicken cutlet. He was not a fan of the calamari - it was a little tough and way spicy. That's okay - the rest of the food he said was delicious!\n\nOverall it was a little pricey for what we got ($56 for two people), but it was great. I'd recommend them to anyone in the area!"
"1","My son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day, he has been finding hair in his food. That's fucking disgusting. I hope this place goes out of business.\n\nMy family will never eat there again."
"2","There's a lot of hidden gems to be found here.\n\nYou just need to be the kind of shopper that knows what to buy and what not to buy at this store.  It's an \""it is what it is\"" situation.  Don't come in here with delusions that every product is a winner.\n\nFrom time to time, they'll have toys in here that are $6.99 at Target and ToysRUs.  In those instances, I'll get one of each kind for my kids.\n\nIt's a great feeling to walk into a place and know that you can totally afford everything in there.  Haha!"
"1","No one should EVER be able to sit in the drive-thru and write a review on Yelp while waiting for their order! There is no GOOD reason why it's taking this long. My goodness! And don't just throw my food and money at me! And these cold ass fries! Im so glad I dont eat this bs any more! Holy cow!"
"2","I work at a doctors office and Scott provides us with prescription pads, business cards, road signs, you name it! We have always been happy with the outcome of our products. They have managed to take a few words on paper and even whip up design ideas. I highly recommend these guys for any printed material. \nWe recently had an error on a prescription pad order. Scott took back the order, repaired it, and delivered it free the same day. Awsome!"
"2","I just want to hug that sweet little old man who runs the front.  SO NICE.\n\nThe orange chicken is delicious.  We're also a big fan of the teriyaki... portion sizes are pretty big but leftovers never stick around in the fridge for long.  The sauce is great though.\n\nThe decor is plain but I think they're trying to update it a bit... the location is a little sketchy.  But the food definitely makes up for it.\n\nDefinitely a Chandler must."
"2","Really good food for the price you pay. I love their Yakisoba !!!!! Also I just love the little old man who works the front. He is always so happy and really does his best to make his customers happy.. \nThat's why I feel guilty giving this place only four stars.. But I'm giving them 4 stars because  I wish there was another person to help with taking orders and taking phone orders.. Usually it's pretty busy and the poor man is juggling everything in front so it could take awhile to order and get your food.\nTip- call in your order and just pick up! So much faster :)"
"2","Someone deleted my review.. intentionally. That is very rude and disrespectful. Don't be silly guys..\nI like this place and new owner is very nice and friendly. I really liked the chicken yakisoba and now they have more sushi stuffs too!! I cant wait to try them all. :) Good price and service :)"
"1","I'm not sure what happened to this place, but over the last 6 months it has taken several steps in the wrong direction. The quality of the food is the only reason this is a two start review, and not a one star. The service is getting slower every visit, and the pricing fluctuations are ridiculous. The once $.99 breakfast biscuits are now $2.99. Two hundred percent increase in less than 6 months!"
"1","Didn't care for it.  Expensive, small portions, and mediocre cooking.  Go a few blocks west to Saigon Pho if you want the real thing.  But this place is prettier, whatever that's worth to you."
"1","What the pho, man?!\n\nThe food is bland.  It tastes like they cater to the elderly.\n\nThe prices are high for the type of food you are getting.  Nobody should have to bay over $5.75 for ANY type of pho.  \n\nI've gone there 2x and I don't know if it's just me, but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times.  She was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate.  \n\nThey focus more on decor and trying to \""entertain\"" their patrons rather than focusing on what's really important... the food.\n\nYou want a really good, AUTHENTIC bowl of Pho?  Go to Saigon Pho on Alma School/Knox.  It's not as ritzy and refined, but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive, tastes better, and they serve you much larger portions.  \n\nEat at Cyclo if you want to have a SEEMINGLY over-attentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat.  (I say \""seemingly\"" because while you may think she's over-attentive, in reality, she hasn't even done as much as refill your water glass.)"
"2","This place is very trendy and the service is great. The staff is friendly and always ready  to recommend dishes. They do not sell alcohol but you can bring your own wine and they will serve it for you. A great spot for meeting friends. I love their pho...."
"2","Addicted to the spicy green beans :) and pan fried egg noodles are my go to main dish.\nI have tried several things that are good here but love the fried noodle with beef, shrimp and scallops. Husband loves the Pho, fried rice is great, lemon grass chicken, black pepper shrimp all good. If you chose wisely, it's not difficult to eat healthy here too which is a +.  \n\nWe love to bring people here for the adventure...if they haven't had vietnamese before and then there's the Justina experience. She's a little spit fire and adds a ton of fun to the already great atmosphere. BYOB makes even more affordable."
"1","Not impressed I will try again. I believe in second chances. Amazing service that's all I can say food didn't do anything for me."
"2","I have gone to Dr. Johansen for over a year now.  It wasn't until last week that I spent any real time in his chair.  I needed a couple of crowns and had to replace a 40 year old filling.  I went to a couple of other dentists in the area.  Dr. Johansen's office is head and shoulder above the others.    \n\nThe doctor's work was done quickly with minimum of pain.  The office is very well run.  The dental hygienists, and assistants are very competent.   Scheduling is easy and efficient.  A real person calls to confirm the appointment a day prior.  I really dislike when a machine calls.  \n\nA little about the office.   It is meticulously clean as a dentist office should be.  The equipment is seems to be first rate, clean and sanitary.  Everyone in the office is pleasant and efficient.  They understand how to work with insurance companies too.  \n\nTo my mind the perfect dentist would be one that could filter out that high pitched whine of the dental drill."
"2","This place is awesome.  I brought my 2007 Jeep Cherokee because my brakes were making a squeezing noise.  The owner said that I just need back brakes and my front brakes had another 15k miles on them.  I will not go to another place.  If I had brought my car to another shop, they would have told me to change the front brakes too."
"1","Although I agree with allot of other reviews about this place being clean, offering alternatives like rebuilt parts for repairs and so on, in the last 6 months their prices have gone up AT LEAST 10%, they no longer offer any coupons to returning customers, NOT even on oil changes and they've hired a lady for the front office.  So it seems that their success was gained at the cost to their customers.  I too have gotten quotes from them on services that I can find elsewhere for on average 15% less.  Lastly, the owner needs to stay AWAY from the customers.  I needed a ride to and from their shop about 6 months ago, which, by the way they advertise as a \""free\"" service. I LIVE LESS THAN 2 MILES AWAY FROM THE SHOP.  When I was at the desk paying for my repairs, he had to add, very sarcastically, that they had given me the FREE rides.  Maybe that's why they hired the woman for the front desk.  Personally, Jim was much more knowledgeable and a better CSR."
"2","I used to visit AJ's only for the sweets (Joseph Schmidt's truffles, gourmet chocolates, cheesecakes/bombes, Napoleons, cannolis, gourmet cookies) and the cheese department.  Noticed Philippines' San Miguel beers available here, too (at least they were last year).  Laloo's goatmilk ice cream used to be sold here, but today's visit yielded none in the aisles.  I've always wanted to try their hot foods, but it was only tonight's dinner that appealed to me- salmon with stuffed crab w/ a white cheese cream sauce.  Sides were an awesome scalloped potatoes w/ bacon and cream sauce and very dry-looking \""honey- glazed\"" carrots.  Thinking I'd have dinner elsewhere, I asked only to sample the potatoes, and they were so delicious!  Next time, plans be da*ned, if AJ's serving anything crab-stuffed and those scalloped potatoes, I'm definitely going to dine there!\n\nOther than for the specialty-food counters, you won't catch me shopping here... too expensive!  Better to shop at Whole Foods... Products are less-expensive, many are organic, and you won't find anything with trans-fats!"
"2","Great place for waxing! They are so nice and professional. :)"
"2","Very good food, great service."
"2","Indian food.\n\nLunch Buffet.\n\nRice pudding.\n\nNuff said."
"1","DON'T DO IT . . .\n\nThis Quality Inn is anything but quality. Rooms are TINY. . Internet does not work. AT ALL and they have 4 different routers. When you ask the front desk about it they tell you to try to reach one of the other motels internets or maybe Mc Donalds. Told them nicely that it was bad, the said \""You've not stayed here before\"".  \n\nRooms were very small and not ready when we arrived at 6 PM at night.  Chair at desk had broken casters, explained to managment about it, wasn't taken care of.  When I went to shower the second night there I opened the shower towel to dry off and it looked like it had been used to polish shoes.  After speaking to three fellow co-workers about the experence, they stated that thier towels were the same way . . .  \n\nI guess it all hotels in the local area were booked and I had to work in the area again . . .  I'd stay again if I didnt' have a sleeping bag for my truck."
"2","I looooove Jason's Deli.  I would have to say it's one of the best Deli's I have ever been to.... Ever!  I order from there all the time and never get sick of it. They have a huge menu, which typically will make me leery of a place, because really, who can perfect that many items?.... Jason's!  All their food is made fresh to order, and they will modify anything on the menu to meet your needs.  Their online ordering system is easy to use and allows you to save your favorite orders.   They also have a great salad bar and their soups are fantastic.  My favorite is their vegetarian French onion soup, served in a bowl with boiling hot provolone cheese,  yum!  You will leave stuffed to the max or with leftovers, but don't forget to grab a complimentary ice cream cone on your way out."
"2","Definitely a favorite Lunch spot! My friends and I eat here often. Yummy sandwiches, soup and salad- all for a really great price. I love the newly remodeled look and open seating, specially the patio area when the weather is nice. The staff is friendly and helpful, which is always a plus for me. \n\nBe warned the portions are very generous! The Muffalettas are no joke! Their salad bar is a great option if you're not sure what you're in the mood for. Trying out the day's special is usually not a bad choice either. The only complaint I have is that I really like their pasta & meatballs except they no longer have spaghetti- only bow-ties and penne now. I hope they bring back spaghetti!!! \n\nEnjoy their complimentary mini muffins and end your meal w/ their free low-fat frozen yogurt!"
"2","I love the food here but what I love the most are the people who work here. The employees are very great customer service providers and they thrive to go out of their way to be friendly. Thank you!"
"1","Hey Hastings and Hastings--\n\nHere's your update.\n\nThe rude, hostile, snotty girl who answers your phone told me I had no case and absolutely refused to let me speak with an attorney.  \n\nPhillips and Lyon just got us an accident settlement offer of almost $15,000."
"1","We ordered a cake, we picked it up got it home and cut into it.  It was a white cake with white ice cream. Nothing else in it, not what we ordered.  I called the store and was told thr Manager was at Queen Creek and Alma School store,  he wasn't I left my info and my issue.  I called back to this store lrft my info and issue. Never received a call back."
"1","I was looking forward to the biscuit's and gravy, so I request a sample before I ordered ( just to make sure I'd like it) and was not impressed, it was loaded with pepper and not really creamy. I opted for the corn beef hash. It was straight from a can, the potatoes were hard and muffin slightly burnt. The eggs were good though and I liked the coffee. I won't be back as the service was beyond slow, and they were NOT that busy to justify it. I went as fellow yelpers claimed it was the greatest biscuit's and gravy, I guess it's made different in the Pacific Northwest."
"2","If you are into gardening or would like to purchase plants that do not die in a few days, buy them from Lowe's. I loved the selection in plants they had. The people who work in the garden center were available to answer questions and they had a huge selection of flowers and also vegetables including bulbing onions etc."
"2","The service was awesome, the lady at the counter gave me a great suggestion and I loved it! Word to the wise: It is crowded during lunch time! But damn worth the wait! :)"
"1","I usually love places with a 50's diner atmosphere and walking into this place, it was no exception - it's cute. The jukebox, booths, decor, etc, etc make this a fun-looking place. The food (I had a burger) was okay, but nothing special. On another occasion, I went in with the sole purpose of getting a chocolate malt to go for my boyfriend and it was over $6 for just a malt. That was the point when I realized I would never be back to 5 & Diner. I think that's outrageous and hell, they're almost robbing you."
"1","Closed"
"1","Having first oil change in this little car. Terrible service compare to the Honda and Toyota dealerships I been at.  Employees don't smile, no water for customers on the fridge, no snacks or news paper. Employees using the same restroom customers do.  The waiting area need to make lots of changes to make customers happy."
"1","Lol this place sucks balls, some broad sent me an email on Saturday when I was at he bar down the street, the email said, \""come test drive a car and get a free $50 dollar gas card.\""  Who am I to not like free gas?  I swerve my way over to Freeway Chevy, get in in the flagship Diesel crew cab and proceed to hammer down on this bad boy around the shopping center next to it.  I get back in and the guy wants to talk numbers, I say lets talk $50 dollar gas card.  He gets up and then brings back the heffer that sent me that email to begin with, she says \""so you're not looking to buy?\"" I reply with \""hell no.  I want my free gas card for wasting my time on this test drive like your email implies.\""  She gets pissed, storms off, mumbling something like they will mail it to me lol.  Thanks for letting me spin the tires in that $60K truck porkchop, you better have gotton my mailing address right or Ill be back in to test drive the new Vette and do some doughnuts on your lawn."
"1","New signage system makes it a waste of my time to come in\n The dungeon ladies room is the last straw"
"1","The worst doctor's experience my boyfriend has ever had. Not by Ish but by the male nurse practitioner. He went in for anxiety medication, something he has been prescribed in the past by his old doctor in Washington...nothing new. The nurse practitioner interrogated him heavily, was rude, disrespectful, and extremely DISCRIMINATORY! He gave my already anxious boyfriend a panic attack because of his actions. I cannot believe they allow him to even speak to patients!! They gave him a prescription for blood pressure and a SSRI Antidepressant medication that he told the doctor he has bad side effects from. \n\nIn short, the nurse practitioner harassed my boyfriend, didn't listen to his needs and concerns.\n\nUPDATE: The nurse practitioner is no longer there."
"1","Stayed here February 16 thru 20 2012 ...was upgraded to a two room suite due to my diamond status...the original charge was to be 129.00 but they charged me 149.00 due to the upgrade..That was BS since they did the upgrade without me asking for it...the room was so so.. The kitchen was small no measuring cups for cooking...needs more utensils...the staff had no clue how to answer the questions asked them.  Tim the manager was terrible and tried to tell me that the room was discounted to 149.00 but I never asked for it..they over booked not my problem..will never stay here again.."
"2","Pretty good store. Deserves 4 * from me. Well, maybe more like 3.75* but whatever. \n\nHas a nice selection of somewhat a bit more \""Off the beaten\"" path stuff. Anything from picture frames, to pictures, to furniture, rugs, cloth, food and booze. Anyone can find something they like at the store. \n\n  Their furniture is cool and often artisan crafted in some back water countries. Makes it unique and interesting. We have a trunk from them and its pretty neat. \n  Trinkets isles are cool and offer wide selection of useless junk to blow your hard earned money on. \n  I usually skip food section as its not very exciting, especially with AJs beeing next door. \n  Now, wine section is something i spend my time on. They have wine from all over the worls from CA to Greece. This makes it a very interesting shopping, especially if you throw in sales they may have at the moment. Wine section is possibly best part of the store.\n\n\""I like\""\n\nEugene"
"1","I love Michaels as a brand.  I enjoy crafting, new hobbies, and everything Michaels is about... I could spend my life savings in there without much of a thought.  I worked at a Michaels for two years (mind you, my feelings of shopping at Michaels are independent from my feelings of working for them) so I'm intimately familiar with corporate standards and what the employees are up against.  This store FAILS.  \n\nCustomer service: I've rarely so much as been greeted by an employee here.  When I seek someone out, they act like it's an inconvenience for them to stop what they're doing and answer my question.. or God-forbid, walk with me to another section.  If a second cashier is called up for the always-way-too-long checkout lines, they too act like it's such an inconvenience.  I saw a woman with \""assistant manager\"" on her name tag walk right by me, standing in the back of a 10-person, impatient line, without stopping to help, calling for other help, saying a word to anybody, or even making eye-contact.  Ignoring us doesn't make us go away.  \n\nStore cleanliness: There are consistently shipping boxes from incoming merchandise, overstock boxes, and extra product stacked in the aisles.  The same boxes stacked on top of the aisles is more out of the way, but still tacky.  Every retail store has to deal with customers putting things down in the wrong spot, even the wrong department, and routinely go through putting things back... that doesn't happen here, at least not often.  \n\nFraming department: I had a poster that I am VERY fond of framed here.  Again, working at Michaels I was trained in the framing department, so I know their standards.  To start, the frame samples are kept behind a counter, so I expected the associate to help me identify which ones I wanted to see.  She would bring out only the ones I specified, one at a time, as I asked for them... no advice, suggested alternatives if one didn't work, or opinions in any way.  No price guidance, no aesthetic guidance, no questions about what I was looking for, not even a trace of up-selling, and frankly no help.  I made my decisions somehow, and left it for the 10 days it would take.  When I came to pick it up, there was some of the poster \""fine print\"" (copyright info I think) half visible, half cut off by the frame.  When I asked about it, they said they had been trying to center the print, and that's how it had to be.  No, no...first of all, it still wasn't centered, so that's no excuse.  Secondly, that's a big problem, not collateral damage they should have been ok with.  Shouldn't they strive for perfection when I'm paying a lot of money for professional framing?  They agreed to re-frame it (another week) and it was positioned correctly the next time.  The last problem was evident after I got it home.  The poster, which was purchased rolled up, had small creases in it over the entire surface from having been rolled so long.  In my frame shop, it wasn't even questioned if a poster would be dry-mounted, it just was.  That would have smoothed out the poster since it is essentially adhering the poster to a piece of foam-board.  If they didn't want to include that automatically, fine, but they should have offered.  These framing \""experts\"" should have known what would happen without it and suggested a solution.  I'd have paid extra to have it done, I obviously was willing to pay to have the whole project done well.  These framers didn't take my project seriously; I mean it was a small job (relatively cheap compared to other custom frames), and a reproduced poster as opposed to original art.  Why should they exert effort into that?\n\nThe ONE exception to this review is ONE employee I saw a couple times, who went out of her way to help me.  She came to ME to ask if she could help, she was friendly, and she offered her help as a cashier when they got backed up from having only one register open.  She was on the replenishment crew, so customer interaction isn't even her usual job.  Unfortunately, everything else about this store has convinced me to stop shopping there and drive the extra ten minutes to Tempe Marketplace.  This store needs a serious corporate overhaul."
"1","I usually like shopping at Michaels but I just don't like this store.  I don't like walking through the cramped doorway for starters. The customer service level also needs some upgrading.  Luckily I could find the supplies I needed without needing any help.  I've been in this store several times and the staff have never been all that helpful or friendly. This store is only down the street from Hobby Lobby where you can find some of the same items and then Jo-ann's really isn't that far away either, so you would think they'd be more responsive to their customers.  This store could use a makeover and it needs to provide its employees with some customer service training."
"1","Have been coming here since they opened.  The last six months or so something has changed.\n\nThe quality of the food and service has suffered.\n\nOne time I was meeting a friend for lunch and had to call the manager out to the dining area because the music was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.\n\nAnother two times the rice was under cooked.\n\nPortion size is way down.\n\nEmployees back talk you when you ask to have a kids meal made a particular way due to a finicky eating child.\n\nI think I'll start driving out to the Chandler mall location."
"1","Love, love, love BBW! I was going to purchase the car freshers and I went into grab 4 (buy 4 get 2 free) and the associate came looking over breathing down my clavicle , scapula and humerus area! Like WTF did you think I was stealing? I was going to just put the items back and go to another BBW but I decided to just make my purchase and get out of that store."
"1","Bad day? I don't know. I've had better meals at other Red Lobster restaurants. The only good thing about tonight's experience was the waiter, Bryan. Fast, efficient, polite and funny, just how I like it. We had a Lobsterita (huge margarita) and shared it. Regretted it too, since it was way too sour and had a chemical taste to it. I couldn't take but two sips and then I switched to something else that I knew it'll taste much better, water. The salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes. Croutons were ok. The all too familiar hot bread was good, as it is always. The main dish, a medium cooked steak and grilled shrimp was delivered on time. Steak was chewy at best, although the marinade's taste was ok. Shrimp were grilled well, not too much or too little. My wife's shrimp scampi was absolutely tasteless, overcooked shrimp in some sort of shrimp juice, with very little butter and no garlic. Pretty horrifying if you ask me.\n\nI think this is the last visit we're going to pay to this location. As I said before, I've had much better meals there and I cannot justify the bill when we are not satisfied with the quality of food. Too bad..."
"2","Always a favorite.  Took my wife for Mothers Day and was not disappointed.  If you want a good seafood dinner and don't want to make reservations I highly recommend."
"2","You know what this place deserves a great review from me. Yeah, yeah I know what you're thinking \""Jamie it's just a Red Lobster\"". It is a Red Lobster and I am a regular customer here because my dad loves this place and honestly I don't have anything bad to say about them. Their service has always been spectacular; all of their wait staff have been nothing but fun and friendly to my very dysfunctional family. I've had many items on the menu and have enjoyed everything. Not to mention, they have a great bar. Where else can I get a double sized frozen margarita with my seafood meal? This place handles large parties gracefully and easily splits checks when needed. This Red Lobster has served me and my family well for years. I love the different \""fest\"" seasons too, Lobster Fest being my favorite!"
"2","We were craving food from this place so badly the other night that I drove all the way from South Phoenix to Chandler to pick some up! The food was ready just a few minutes after I got there, and they must have packaged it *really* well (or made it super hot) because it was still hot when I got home 30 minutes later. We didn't try anything new (just the Pad Thai and duck curry, our favorites from last time), but it was just as delicious. The only change I made was ordering our curry \""5\"" (on the 1 to 5 spiciness scale) - it was definitely hot but not as hot as we would get in the Bay Area when we asked for spicy. Can't wait to go back again!"
"1","For those of you who have given this restaurant a 5 star rating --- WHAT THE HECK WERE YOU THINKING!!!!! WERE YOU DRUNK?\n\nThe food was eeewww...their restrooms were even more eeeewwwww. I saw cockroaches near their kitchen and in the restrooms. The tables were dirty. The carpet looked like it has been there for 20 years...cough, cough.... The service by wait staff was courteous but our food took forever to come out. Tom Yum Soup tasted only like Chicken Broth. The shrimp in it was so bland...eeewwww. The fried rice had some dried out spots making me wonder how long it had  been sitting outside. The prices are way too high for the level of food that was served and apart from that, if  I am going to shell out $50+ for a 2 person dinner than it is expected that the ambiance of the restaurant be at least at the level of PF Changs e.t.c... Really bad experience."
"2","Had been to this place awhile ago (probably previous owners or before they remodeled) and was ok with the food but it was a bit dated (and there was a bug on my table).\n\nYears later came back with a coworker and wow have things changed! They've since redecorated and it's super clean now (no more fear of bugs).\n\nThe pad thai I had was delicious and coconut ice cream was awesome. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to get a Thai fix."
"1","Been ordering from this Ray Road Pizza Hut for 6 years,  usually $50-$70 per order for parties at our house.  Now, this franchise has started charging for red peppers and cheese packets.  Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?"
"1","We ate at Carrabba's in Chandler last night. It was okay, but I have had better. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was pleasant enough, but neglected to advise me that they do not have green peppers to put on my pizza. The entire table heard me, so when my pizza came out it was covered with pepperocini. I sent it back, and they remade it, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). One can get much better pizza and service at Nello's a few miles away, or Humble Pie. It will be a long time before I go to Carrabba's again."
"2","been here dozen's of times, finally decided to review them. The food is a step above the average Italian restaurant and the Sangria blow's away any other we've tried and we've tried quite a few. The mood is good and the manager, John, makes sure you are properly taken care of from service to food quality. Try the John Cole for a tasty dessert after stuffing yourself"
"2","Our favorite waitress is back! As is the old manager (John, I think?). They must have had an off night with a new manager subbing and it went dreadfully wrong. We decided to try it again after they introduced a reward program and were pleasantly surprised. \n\nI had one great meal (same items as last time), went back a couple of weeks later and tried something different (the Italian Classics). Delicious! However, I tried it again the following week and was disappointed. The chicken parmesan was burned. Like dark brown, bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time? It just kind of stayed on your tongue too long after taking a bite and was strangely creamy. Weird. \n\nSo I'll just stick with the calamari, sausage lentil soup and sirloin marsala. \n\nI guess I update my review to say when they are on their game, everything is fantastic, but they can really have off nights occasionally. I guess like many places."
"1","FINALLY got piece back, but took almost a month of false promises, \""almost ready, next week, k come get it, wait...not yet etc\"" \n\nThen at the end, after all that, I don't know if he did this on purpose or was just not 'there' , but did not add in the 10% 'discount' I was offered for waiting 21+ days for what I thought was a simple watch repair.   10% off that they give everyone for 21+ days of waiting and that was my bonus prize.  \n\nI could go in details about why the delays happened, or at least what I was told, but instead I will just be shopping elsewhere for my future \""Fast-Fix\"" watch repairs. \n\nThanks for the repair as it looks GREAT, that's where the 1 star comes in. \n\nEverything else, lol. \n\nGood luck in your future endeavors."
"2","Excellent food! The cheesecake is amazing!!!"
"2","My wifes new addiction...the farfalle is the bomb!"
"2","I hadn't been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why  I don't come here more often. Probably the calories but the food was really good! I had the buffalo chicken strips and ordered a side of mashed potatos. Made my own meal! My daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good. I love their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake. They also have the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had and they do sell it to go. I usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and veggies. They do have a new \""skinny\"" menu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items! The menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out!"
"2","I went with a large group of people on a Friday night.  They don't take reservations, so it took us about an hour to be seated.  Service was prompt, but the waitress had so many tables it took about 45 minutes for the food to come after ordering.  Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."
"1","I visited this location a couple of weekends ago. I was alone and just wanted to have lunch before I went to see a movie. I was seated in a section that was pretty much empty. I was placed in a corner and no server over to my table for 10 minutes. I even went so far as to make eye contact with a server and wave at her and she just looked away. I got up and went to the hostess station and told them that I wasn't going to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am a former server, bartender and host and I feel like this is unacceptable for the staff to flat out ignore someone."
"1","I wish I could have gave this 0 stars but I can't first thing there was a hair in my food and everyone has only ate a little of there food and had to stop cuz we was disgust my one friend Alex was sick from it them we got the manager and she only was gonna say sry then we was like can u take all this off and she only took the noodles off although we a couldn't eat our food it seems like everytime I come there there's a problem or hair in my food and I think it's because we ask for our food crispy when I ask Chrispy we get a hair when we don't no hair plus very rude customer service NEVER EAT HERE"
"1","I go to this location ALOT and yesterday I did not have a good experience. Grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe, but no seating area open at the moment. So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables. It was sort of rude, so I dropped off the books that I planned to purchase and left the store. I saw a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. I rate this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude."
"1","Not my favorite place. I went today to get added RAM for my MAC computer. I was unable to purchase this at the apple store due the fact that apple only carries current stuff in their store bc space is limited. The guy that was helping at Best Buy, not friendly, not knowledgable, unable to answer questions I had. Needless to say, I did not purchase from Best Buy. Off to Frys electronics I go."
"1","I would not come here again for anything. Everything is over priced... Really this is Just a Showroom for Amazon."
"1","What a mess. This place USED to be so good on customer service. But now it is like they don't even care. My wife wanted to see the new Kindle Fire. They were working on the display. A worker grabbed one to show my wife. This old shrew of a woman yelled NOOO!!! and took it back. Like my wife seeing it for 30 seconds was some security breach. Added to this we found out they don't offer loaner phones when you are getting your phone worked on. They are also adding deductibles back to their plans. So basically there is no reason to go there over your local Verizon. The place is just a mess and the employees are apathetic. They won't answer questions. They don't get trained anyway. I for see them being out of operation within 5 years!"
"1","Seriously, I have always loved Kona Grill. I think the problem is not with all the Kona locations but just this one at the Chandler mall. We sat on the patio for happy hour and we could find very little happy. \n\nI have never been a server, as I know if I tried, it would be an epic fail. I really appreciate what they do and the good ones make it look so easy, even though I know it is a very demanding job. This night we were continually ignored to the point of given the finger several times. NO, not the middle one, the I will be right with you finger. When we did get the attention of our server, he seemed irritated he had to wait on us. \n\nI understand at happy hour they get busy but message to the management, hire more servers. People are desperately looking for jobs and what do you pay them, like $2.30 an hour? \n\nThe good news was the food was fresh and arrived quickly (they had expediters). I am happy to report the kitchen staff seems to have their act together."
"2","I came here and we choose to sit outside, that isn't really outside since it is covered next to the mall entrance. Service was nice and everything I had to eat was very nice, and I had the pot-stickers and shrimp and salmon sushi rolls. The shrimp tempura was the nights personal favorite. The right amount of rice and flavor for what you pay for - nothing experimental or crazy. \n\nOutside has a nice feel, but is louder and doesn't invite for any easy conversation. Inside it is quieter and they have nice tall stuffed seating arrangements, that I did not make use out of this time. Overall it has a nice vibe, even if I perceive it as a little manufactured. \n\nI am having some issues defining this place, are they trying to sell an upscale experience and yet call themselves a grill? Focusing on seafood but having almost anything else on the menu. Yeah, it is a little too eclectic for me - but then again both service and food is good, and I will come here again so I guess the undefinition joke is on me."
"2","Really good.  Garret was our server, late nite b4 a movie this place really hit the spot.  Our server was on point.  Kitchen was solid.  This definitely is our new late nite spot.  Comfy chairs too!"
"1","So this is the second and last time I'll be having dinner at Kona Grill. First time I had a pulled pork sandwich which was decent but not very exciting.  I enjoyed the chicken satay appetizer and the nice drink/wine list,  along with the modern,  relaxed atmosphere.  Really like sitting on the patio or in the bar area.  However,  the main dishes are mediocre at best. I always give places a second shot but our second visit was even more underwhelming.  I had the sea bass and my husband had the pork tenderloin.  Both were prepared well but pretty much tasteless and boring.  And expensive.  I love good food and I'll pay for anything worth it,  however this sea bass was not a $26 dish.  Not on any planet.  I'd recommend this as a nice place to meet for drinks and maybe apps and desserts but do not bother with an entree. I can name at least 10 other places in the valley with better food for those prices."
"1","Never, ever trust TGI to install  your carpet or provide a rebate in the promised time. EVER. Especially if you are promised a rebate."
"1","This Panda Express location is a difficult one to review.\n\nAs is typical of the Panda, the food's good and cooked up fast. No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.\n\nBut then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.\n\nThe selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes."
"1","Did i really just pay 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich? the \""prime rib dip\"" looked so good on the menu, but what showed up at my table was a weak, dried up little sandwich, with no flavor, chewy overcooked meat, and served on what was nothing more than a tiny, hard oversized breadstick.\n\nour waitress annie, while pleasant enough, seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside, and DID NOT want a to go container. i dine out a lot, and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing i've been served in a long time.\n\nThe \""game day nachos\"" were almost equally sad. at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chips and the same gross \""cheez-whiz\"" style sauce you squirt on your nachos at the local 7-11. disgusting\n\nthe rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers, even though my son ate less than half of his, and also did not want a to go container.\n\nat $65 for 3 people ($78 with tip) this was a completely dissatisfying and overpriced meal."
"1","While the quality of the food is good, the priority of the kitchen really makes you wonder at how they even function at times. While our visit was on a week night and when it really wasn't all that busy, they still somehow managed to complete three orders that were no more complicated than ours... for people that ordered AFTER US. \n\nI had a half sandwich with salad and her with a bowl of soup. How complicated is that, seriously? The person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff. \n\nThis was disappointing to say the least and perhaps was an isolated incident. Then again, most likely not.\n\n*Update*\n\nI have received a very nicely worded and very sincere email from one of the founders relating to our visit. We have spoken about this visit in question and I am satisfied with the end result. As such, I have amended my review from two stars to three.\n\n*Update to update*\n\nAs of today, 22 DEC 14, I have yet to receive any further contact as it related to my initial review despite replying both via Yelp and a direct email as requested. As such, my review goes back down to two stars. Pretty disappointed given how promising the initial contact seemed to be. We definitely will not be going back now"
"1","Worst Mexican in the valley. It really is. ESPECIALLY for a joint that has such awesome location, building and name. SHAME! Stay away. There is not much else i can add except - I'd like my money back, please."
"2","This restaurant serves really good mexican food at reasonable prices. The location and decor are great and make it look like a really expensive restaurant without the high prices. The service is almost always top-notch and prompt. My pick from the extensive menu would be the enchiladas."
"2","If you have not experienced Abuelo's I highly recommend you give it a try.    In my opinion the food is excellent.     The shrimp chowder is to die for.    Their prime rib on Thursday's is the best.     Their traditional mexican food is good.     I  tend to like all their other  fish, beef & pork menu items.      You cannot go wrong by trying this establishment."
"1","While visiting the area from Cali, my friend was told about this place by some women who work at Nordies. So, we decided to try it out as we were both hungry for Mexican food. Ate here on a Friday night, waited about 10 minutes to be seated and had ordered off the gluten free menu shortly after. I choose the three ground beef tacos on soft corn torts. Most gluten free torts aren't soft, so I questioned that before ordering. Also, I wanted to substitute the meat for carne asada as I am not a fan of ground beef but the waiter said that they put MSG in their carne asada. Yuck, I thought and decided to stick with ground beef. They were okay, nothing special. They do have yummy green mild salsa though, which was better than my entire dinner. Service was great. I haven't heard that a Mexican restaurant uses MSG in their food before though. My friend order their chicken and steak fajitas, she said it was okay. I wondered though if her meat had MSG too. Eek!!"
"1","Ate there with the wife last night. Everything tasted to us like it was straight out of a can and came to the table cold. Server was nice, but the everything home made speech is a crock. Just because it was put in a pot, then from a pot to a plate does not mean it should be called homemade or hand made."
"2","The Monetary is amazing we love the spinach enchilada"
"2","I love their super thin chips and the salsa is great. The food is good for a chain and the service is terrific.\n\nI love their guacamole cream and their flan and Tres Leche is to die for!"
"1","Tried Abuelo's last night with some friends. Ambience and decor are lovely.\n\nHad Grandieza frozen margarita ($5!) that was solid and refreshing! It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.\n\nHuge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.\n\nOrdered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!\n\nA friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her \""Well, lemme see what I can do\"". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh\n\nNo add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.\n\nI won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar."
"1","How do you have a bad experience at a Nordy's? I thought that this was impossible. Let me preface this by saying that it wasn't really the Nordy's that bothered me so much but the MAC counter at Nordy's. \n\nI'll just sum it up in three sentences:\n\nOne....Absolutely could not keep their scheduling on point and caused my friend and I to be late to a wedding. Two....Rude and oblivious associates that would rather have you wait because they couldn't possibly take more than two appointments an hour even though they had a total of count them with me....eight people just standing around doing NOTHING. Three....Its quite apparent they have no appreciation or respect for their customers as I saw them make snide faces at their customers and rudely gossip about customers once they left. \n\nAwful and Absurd. Get a new set of associates for this location. \n\nI'm SOOO glad this is NOT my Nordy's. I'll never come to this location ever again."
"1","I love nordstrom, but not this one. Customer service is absolutely horrible!! Employees are rude and completely unhelpful."
"1","On 9/2/13 my wife and I went to the Chandler Mall Sears to buy a tool set for our sons birthday. We selected the set we wanted (no assistance from the staff). I carried the ~40 lb box to the checkout counter. We had parked near another entrance so I left my wife to check out while I moved the car. I didn't think I'd have to ask the checkout clerk to help my wife get the box to the curb. but sure enough when I asked my wife if the clerk helped her she said no. When the checkout process was complete he turned his back to her and sat down on the counter. That is where I found him when I went back in and ripped him a new one in front of other customers. We then contacted the department manager named Veronica (the same one mentioned in another review here). Veronica was of no help and in fact her attitude made me realize the store management is the problem. They do not care if customers are helped or walk out happy. I'm not sure where they think this strategy is going but my guess is it will take Sears out of business."
"1","I purchased a SF Giants and tried to return it a week later. cashier said there were \""sweat stains\"" on it and i explained to him that i tried it only once at home and never wore it outdoors at all. here's a tip, be sure to check for \""sweat stains\"" before buying a hat at The Hat Club."
"2","Pretty nice. I was reluctant to go at first but it was totally not disappointment. Menu has a ton of items and most of them somewhat unusual and interesting. We had tandoori chicken pizza and it was pretty Ok, as far as pizzas from this kind of joints go. Salads looked very enticing as well. I think its pretty nice.\n\n\""I like\""\n\nEugene"
"1","I agree with the last reviewer, this Baja is going downhill. Baja was always  like the more beautiful, delicious cousin of Rubio's (if you consider your cousin delicious). I received my quesadilla and while it usually has a few types of cheeses in it, this one had some rubbery cheese in it with very little cheese in it, like they were cutting back or something. The queso fundido tasted fake, like a plastic doll accidentally dripped overhead into it or something. Ehh, I don't think so..."
"2","One of my favorite places to eat while in Phoenix. The service at this particular one is always great too."
"2","Went here a few weeks ago for brunch. I will say that I am still a fan of Z Tejas but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. I had the potato hash and eggs which was ok but it seemed like it needed something more flavor wise. Maybe a little more sauce on top would have made it better. Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious and refreshing. My companion said that she loved her burger and fries. I still love Z Tejas but I will probably just go for dinner there from here on out since that is where they really shine."
"2","My favorite chicken tortilla soup and corn bread. \nGreat indoor or outdoor seating. \nMany times I have called in for take out food there for dinner parties and have never been disappointed. The food holds great in chaffing dishes and the corn bread is terrific for dinner parties. Cut it into four pieces and place in a linen covered bowl to keep warm and moist. Reheats fabulously."
"1","I really love this place, their food is sooo good.  But the service last night was not so good.  It took them 5 minutes to seat us, then another 5 minutes to wait on us by the time we ordered our food we missed happy hour.  We asked the waitress if we could still order off the happy hour menu and she said no.  It took her forever to bring our drinks finally out and then when our appetizer came out we asked about the cornbread, she said she would go get that.Then when we were finished we didn't get our bill in a timely manner either.  Ughhhh!!!!!\n\nNormally the service is really good but in this case it just wasen't.  Really disappointing last night."
"1","What a lousy experience!!! My family and I get there at 12 noon on a Saturday and the place is almost empty. There's no one at the front desk to greet and seat us. Theres a line of people waiting and no one to help anyone. Eight minutes goes by before a girl finally emerges from the back . She says no word of greeting to anyone. We finally sit and a waiter named Dylan comes to our table and says he'll be back \""in a minute\"" to take our order. Fifteen minutes go by and he never returns to our table. I flag down the manager and he acts annoyed and asks me what I want. I tell him I'd like to order, and to take my families order first  and he starts laughing at me in a mocking tone and with a sarcastic inflection in his voice and says \""I thought you were ready to order\""!. I inform him I'm deferring to my family first to be polite and expect him to be respectful. Needless to say at this point my meal was ruined. The manager is a man in his mid forties dressed like a slob and very disrespectful. He also doesn't manage his staff, as reflected by the disappearing acts the hostess and waiter pulled in a nearly empty restaurant hanging out in the back instead of attending to their customers. and with the disrespectful attitude that manager imposed on me.They have the gall to call this a top level restaurant. You'd receive better service at a Dennys."
"2","This was a good bowling alley. Very clean and the service was friendly. We went on a Friday night and they had black lighting which is always fun. Shoes were decent and nice selection of bowling balls. Music videos from the early 2000s made the experience really fun! Scoreboards are not user friendly but that could be because we aren't big bowlers. Placement of TVs right over lanes was a bit distracting while bowling."
"2","Went to The Keg with my wife as she had never been and Flemings was booked.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.  If you want a real steak go to Flemings or Ruth Chris for a Big League experience."
"1","Terrible service. Went in at 5:00 on a Wednesday for an early dinner. The place was not busy and we were told by the hostess that it would be just a few minutes because the servers were \""polishing the tables\"". 20 minutes later, no one had come or gone, there were at least 5 employees milling around and we were still not seated. Had to walk out. Sitting in Firebirds as I write this."
"2","I was actually really impressed, even though I didn't think I would be.  I headed here for lunch last week when Chipotle was super busy.\n\nThey have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did).\n\nI got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.\n\nMy server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.  Very friendly, not over-crowding.\n\nI'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat), but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!"
"1","I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though). \n\nAlthough I will say that the service was awesome, the \""good\"" ends there. \n\nThe food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it. \n\nThe drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all. \n\nNext time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy."
"1","This location of Starbucks let me down yesterday. It was 11am. I had met my sister here before we headed out on the town for the day. I was hungry for a breakfast sandwich or hot sandwich from the fridge that they will heat in the over for you. They were out of almost all flavors of sandwiches, they had only 3 left. They were also out of all breakfast sandwiches including the turkey bacon with egg, I understand that it was 11am but still, most Starbucks have these sandwiches well into the afternoon hours. \n\nI decided to try the faijita chicken sandwich with pepper jack from the refrigerated section at the counter. The cashier was very rude about the lack of sandwiches in the first place. She got irritated that I asked if they had a ham and swiss sandwich when it wasn't out. Anyhow, she heated up the sandwich and wrapped it up for me. The chicken was disgusting and I pulled a couple of pieces out and they had black spots on them. I am not sure how long that particular sandwich had been sitting out but eww.\n\nI did also have a passion tea and it was delicious as usual. Rule of thumb, come here only for drinks, avoid the food at this location. I would only come back for coffee or tea. Customer service was also not the greatest."
"2","OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it). \n\nI've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour. They have an excellent happy hour for the quality of food they serve. I've tried, obviously the burger and also the crab cakes, both which were yummy. The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!"
"2","I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.\n\nOur servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.  \n\nI ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered cr\u00e8me brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the cr\u00e8me brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my cr\u00e8me brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.\n\nThe only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.   \n\nThat said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it."
"2","I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  Some might question the authenticity of their food, and I'm not asian so I don't consider myself to be an authority.  I do, however, LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it, I'm in heaven :)  The portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is excellent, it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture.  The crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!\n\nYou just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   It makes joints like Panda Express look embarrassing by comparison.  I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items (Sesame Chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option."
"2","I think Pei Wei is great. The food is always good and the location is nice enough to make you actually want to eat there. They do offer wine by the glass so it is a good place for Happy Hour or date night when you are trying to save some money (PF Changs is much nicer ambiance but basically the same food). However, most of the time we do curbside pickup which is awesome. You can also place your order online ahead of time."
"1","Um. . .No.  \n\nHonestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  \n\nFirst off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  \n\nMajor issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.\n\nMy food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the \""from your grocer's freezer\"" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.\n\nOur spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place."
"2","I had always sworn off chiropractors. I think it was the popping sounds that make me nervous. I decided to go to Cottingham, who was recommended by a coworker, as a way to lure in my fiance who was in constant pain. I gave Cottingham 4 stars as this is my first experience and I really had nothing to compare it to. But I do think Jeff is a 5 star guy. On your first visit he will do an exam and take xrays. On your second return he will go over the xrays and plan of care. Being in the medical field, I think Jeff is very good about explanations and helping you understand things visually and physically. His knowledge comes across and made me feel more comfortable with the whole process. I didn't feel he was trying to push me into any unnecessary treatment plan. I'm just sorry I waited so long."
"1","this is located in what used to be a pretty happening strip mall because there was one of the only movie theaters around there.\nthen a new googaplex opened and the whole area kind of dwindled. \nwings are good, i attest to that. but... random shooting where a person dies and four others have to go to the hospital? not really my idea of good time."
"2","I am from the East Coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way, but this one is truly unique in that there are peanut shells littering the floors.  As I sat there, eating the roasted peanuts, and waiting for my food to arrive, I felt uneasy dumping my shells onto the floor.  I said to my friend, OMG, littering is okay here and I do not know how I feel about this.  \n\nSo after my initial shock of dropped peanut shells and the first bite of my Sue-Ruben, and the country music performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere, I started to get into the groove of things.  Throwing your shells on the floor can actually be quite liberating! lol\n\nI am a foodie and I must say that I was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.  It was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in NJ or NYC, but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.  \n\nMy friends wings were a little bland and the hot sauce that he ordered on the side was not that appealing.  Maybe I need to try more of their wings another time, since everyone seems to love them; but I am a stickler at times.\n\nThe service was amazing and they had great drink specials, although I did not partake because I had been drinking earlier at RnR in Scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest.\n\nGo here for: A great country-like setting, great sandwiches, good service, and nice drink specials.  I will be back."
"1","Just came in with my husband for my 6 month ring inspection. It was a Monday afternoon so nobody was in there except like maybe 2 customers. We were not greeted upon entering so my husband walked up to a group of employees who were laughing and joking around to ask for help. They literally ignored him, just let him stand there looking stupid for a good 2-3 minutes. So we walked around the counter obviously looking for some help and had to practically wave our hand in the air and shout before someone would finally help us. Unbelievable customer service. Would not come to this branch if I were you. We definitely did not feel like we were worth a minute of their time."
"1","Worst McDonalds experience ever. Rude ignorant jerk behind the counter, the General Manager standing right next to him, GM said nothing, did nothing about the rotten employee. No greeting, just a dead rude stare, I asked for a meal, he said in a low negative antagonistic tone, \""What about it?!?\"", like he was picking a fight.\nI realize minimum wage gets minimum effort employees, but wow McDonalds!!!!\nI will never go to this location EVER again.\nOh yeah, twice previously got tea that tasted like chemicals, like it was dish water, seriously and on 2 different occasions."
"1","Had my son in classes here and they changed instructors with 0 notice i bought a bow from them that they recommended spent a few hundred bucks on it for my sons birthday they sold me a defective bow and when my son told me due to the fact that I know nothing about bows I tried to return it they won't help me out at all very bad company to work with the instructor is nice I must add"
"2","Lately, I have found myself reading a lot of books, and was looking to pic up some more reading material for my lunch hours at work.  I had already hit bookmans and changing hands, with no luck. So, I decided to hit borders to see what they may have had to offer.\n\nI've been to this location before, but not in a couple months.   I like borders for a few reasons, but I find that their store is well stocked and the staff is usually really friendly.  \n\nI wandered the store, and even though I didnt have a specific book in mind, I had an idea of what I wanted to read.  I like thier bargin book section, and the layout of the store, with overhead signs, and signs on the actual bookstore itself.\n\nEven though I did not purchase anything, shopping here was fun.  Staff was friendly, hours are great, and you can always order those hard to find books that you may need if they dont have them on the shelf."
"1","\""Authentic Mexican Food\"" seems to be a complete lie here. I feel like Taco Bell is more authentic than Espo's. 2 Stars, because the Carne Asada Taco Salad I got was nothing but a bowl of lettuce, a few chips, and small balls of Carne Asada every once in awhile. They took over 30 minutes to deliver our order. (There was only about 5 people in the entire restaurant, 3 of which were already eating.) Then, they got our orders wrong, and also charged us extra to put something that was already included in the salad on the side. Only good thing: The Salsa, and the Bowl it came in."
"1","I stopped in here for dinner recently to see how the place looked after their recent \""remodel\"" and I was surprised to see that even though there were improvements made to the exterior (fresh paint, expanded parking lot, and nicer patio) the inside looked exactly the same except they had replaced the rundown, ugly, uncomfortable tables and chairs with others that were only slightly less ugly and uncomfortable. Everything else was exactly the same, including the layer of grime over all the fixtures, walls, and flooring. I was willing to overlook that since we usually only do takeout anyway but once we ate our food my husband and I both agreed that we would not come here again. The quality of food has been going down the last couple of months but this was a new low. I have never liked the place itself but at least I thought the food was decent but nothing we ordered this last visit was even edible.  Dry, crumbly tamales, burnt tortilla chips, and carne asada that tasted like the meat had spoiled. The worst part was the crispy taco that was disgustingly soggy and filled with a substance that looked like dog food and tasted like what I would imagine that canned dog food tastes like. I mean, it was worse than Taco Bell. Seriously.\n\nThere still seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in the door, again mostly take-out orders, so I guess their customers are very loyal or else not everyone thinks it's gotten as bad as I do. I think most of their loyal fans keep coming back since it is so cheap, but there are lots of better options for cheap Mexican food in Chandler."
"1","I recently went to lunch at Espos, and engaged in an epic battle for a churro.\n\nAs I approached the counter to get my chorizo burrito and churro, the churro was missing and a plate of sopapillas was there instead. Before I could say anything, the woman behind the counter said bluntly, \""We're out of churros, so I gave you sopapillas.\""\n\nI thought about it for a second, and realized only a churro was really worth the extra flab my friends would see at the pool that weekend, and told her, politely, I'd really just prefer to not have sopapillas.\n\n\""You just want your dollar back?\"" she barked, as if I had asked her to drive to the U.S. treasury to collect one. I said yeah, I just love churros, and don't think I need anything else.\n\nShe huffed to the register, grabbed a dollar, and handed it to me.\n\nNow look, one doesn't want to be petty, but really, the churro (after tax) costs $1.26. As I looked at her face that was saying, \""Why couldn't you just eat your damn sopapillas like I told you to?\"" it occurred to me I shouldn't have to pay Espos twenty-six cents for a churro I never got.\n\n\""I think it was a $1.15 on the menu,\"" I said.\n\nOh man, now she was pissed. Saying nothing, she hit a few buttons on the register, \""returned\"" a churro officially, and handed me $1.26.\n\nAll of that drama might be worth it, if the chorizo didn't taste as bland as watery ground beef. Sorry, Espos, I'll just drive to Someburros a block away."
"2","Ticket line fairly quick. Concession had lots of choices prices average for movie theaters. Great seats. Clean and comfortable."
"1","Awful! Floor was so dirty that my shoes almost came off due to sticky substance.\n\nAlso unruly teenagers have taken over this theater. It is no longer possible to enjoy a movie at this location. \n\nThis location is merely a babysitting service for parents to drop off their entitled, disrespectful brats. \n\nIn turn, they ruin everyone else's movie experience."
"2","I've been coming to Tag's for about a year or so and found it to be wonderful place and yes, a trip back in time. Tag's menu incorporate both southwest and American foods in over sized quantities.  While you're there I would recommend the locally made knick-knacks along the walls that you can purchase.  The food is good and service is great!\n\nEnjoy!"
"1","This place has really gone downhill over the past few years. I've been going here for about 3 years (work in the area) and I've seen it go through many changes and it has changed owners and as the new owners continue to change things.\n\nFirst, smoking lounge is gone and they're now making way for the \""Blue Adobe Trading Post\"" where they will continue to sell the horribly tacky, garish, and overpriced rhinestone handbags, shirts, and belts that they've been selling at the bar section recently.\n\nIt also seems like they change out the furniture every two months or so. I don't get why they keep doing this, how they can afford to buy so much furniture, and what the reason for it is. The place is also kept a little too dark for what its trying to be.\n\nThe menu used to be pretty large, but is pretty overpriced for what they offer and for the place. They cut the menu down to a page or two a few weeks ago, but it is still overpriced."
"1","Around Thanksgiving, we went to Mint Thai for lunch (it being our usual thai lunch spot). What a mess. The food wasn't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything. In the end, out of a party of 4, only 1 of us had received what we ordered, 1 of us was violently ill (and remained so for DAYS - having to visit the doctor, etc), 2 of us felt moderately ill later, and only one of us felt ok. Such a disappointment."
"1","Today I ordered a large vanilla cone and paid for it the person at the counter  said \""That'll be right up for you.\"" Well it wasn't right up and I waited for 20 minutes before they finally got around to making it for me. Another time a couple years ago i ordered an ice cream cone and the boy who was working behind the counter made the cone and set it on top the ice cream machine and let it melt. when I asked why my cone was sitting there melting he said very rudely, \"" oh i forgot i made it. here you go.\"" he said and handed me the cone. \""I don't want the melted cone!\"" I said. I was furious and even more so when I had to argue with him that he owed me a new, fresh cone. What an embarassment! C'mon McDonalds, get your stuff together!!"
"1","Saturday I ordered a cheeseburger,  2pc poppers and onion rings.. Not only did I wait 10 minutes the fried food were as hard as rocks, and I was given a double cheeseburger and charged for a double cheeseburger and large poppers.  \nVery unhappy!"
"2","If you are looking through Yelp reviews to find a great nail salon, your search is over. Elite Nails is the BEST!\nI just moved to town, and have been looking for a new nail salon. I am crazy about having well manicured nails, and very picky about who I go to. I have been disappointed by several places in town, until I found Elite Nails. I am very impressed by how well I was taken care of, my nails look great, and the pedicure was amazing! Best massage chair ever! The regular pedicure is only $25 and comes with an exfoliating scrub and hot stone massage! Everyone was very professional while being friendly, they were easy to communicate with, and it was clear to see the people working there not only knew what they were doing but genuinely enjoyed their job. The salon itself is beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable. I'll definitely be back."
"1","Was not impressed. The seaweed salad was drowned in sesame oil and every roll was entirely overwhelmed by sauce (there was a quarter cup of garlic sauce left on the plate when we finished the Primo roll, no hint of exaggeration.) And for a place that charges for forks, you'd think they'd pack the rolls a little tighter so they don't utterly disintegrate. It was heavy, heavy fare and we left feeling overfull and gross even though we ate about half as much as we usually do on sushi night (and both had gas pains for a couple of hours afterward).\n\nThe free strawberry ice cream was not delicious and the fortune cookie was downright weird."
"1","I would give no stars but since I had to give one, one is all they get. After working with the loan department, I have decided to pull our money and move our mortgage. We were approved for our re-finance and then canceled at the last minute once they found out I was working a contract job. We have been a 20+ year B of A customer, currently have our mortgage with them and never have defualted. Yes i was laid off work like 1/2 of America but have managed to keep working a contract position. The contract jobs out here in California usually run for three months at a time and after each quarter, they extend them. I have been at my job since August 2011 and I am due to be extended at the end of June. However they used this as a reason not to go through with our loan. You think  Bank of America would want to help us make it easier to get through the economy crisis. Just to let you know I am speaking about the Loan Department in Chandler Arizona. Not only did they take forever to get the paperwork done, they called and told us to return documents as soon as possible so that our approved loan will get completed. We were told we could sign the paperwork while we were on vacation but never heard anything. Got home and found out they canceled our loan. Never will I use this Bank. Their commitment to customer service sucks."
"1","Was told the replacement for my standard front brake maintenance would take about 45 min.  3 hours later I am still waiting and writing this review. They didn't have the part in stock and than the wrong part was ordered. They offered a free oil change in the future which means I have to come back to use the \""we are sorry\"" voucher, should have offered something while my car is on blocks waiting to be finished. I don't plan on using their services again after this unprofessional fiasco."
"2","Not often you go into a place with a person's name on the door and find that person working the register or cooking, but that's what you will find at Al's.\n\nBeen going here for a few years, but haven't tried much of the menu - the Chicago dogs and fries are just too good. Also recommend the beef sandwich, which comes juicy, tangy, and messy. And let me tell you, some of the best things in life are messy."
"1","I am wondering if the people reviewing this place, positively, have had actual authentic Thai food.\n\nI got a green curry which had cabbage (wtf) snow peas (wtf) no basil (double wtf). It's green curry which is SO Basic - Eggplant, green bell peppers, carrots and basil. Simple.\n\nThis, to me, was Chinese food masquerading as Thai. \n\nI looked through the reviews...it seems like things are hit or miss. What should one order when they come here, I wonder? \n\nSo I guess if you want Authentic Thai Food, go elsewhere. If you're suburban and haven't a clue...enjoy?\n\nFail."
"2","Truly enjoyed the amazing food at Siam Orchid! I was craving Thai Food and we drove over 20 miles to get here. The menu selections were very well written - and to our pleasure the appearance of each dish and the taste exceeded our expectations. A great place for authentic Thai."
"1","I know good thai curry and this was far from it. Service was very good."
"1","Place was pretty dead, only 2 other parties of people. Excellent service, but aside from the appetizer of spring rolls(which were delicious), food was very mediocre. The pad thai was a big pile of barely spicy noodles, chicken and shrimp- no bean sprouts or vegetables. Hubby got a basil chicken dish which he said was ok, but left him still hungry. Neither of our dishes came with rice. We just weren't impressed with the food, but our go-to Thai place, Siam Thai, is run by a family from thailand, so we are a bit spoiled."
"2","Finally an authentic taco shop in AZ!!! Reminds me of home sweet home (chicago). All the staples are there...2 corn tortillas, cabbage, red salsa, limes....they even have ground beef...A rarity in these parts. Couldn't be happier :D"
"2","I brought a picture of the ring I wanted to Paul and his team and they were very excited to help me make this dream a reality.  They worked with my budget and provided pictures of the progress along the way.\n\nPaul and his team were incredibly courteous and professional, they provided top notch customer service and were happy to help explain things to me since I do not know anything about jewelry or diamonds.\n\nI am looking forward to going back to work with them again on wedding bands.\n\nMake sure to visit Paul at Barnes Fine Jewelers for top of the line service and quality when it comes to jewelry design."
"1","Cheap drinks but the bar and scene is very ghetto for being in Gilbert. They have a stage with old big screen tvs on it when it can be used for entertainment. All the other tvs are over 10 years old. Did I also mention the homeless man hanging out the the smokers area....terrible food bad service but hey you definetly get what you pay for."
"2","Love Arby's. However a medium curly fries is allegedly 600(!) calories. So worth it though. 1 star off for their shakes being mediocre. They always seem to be pretty thin."
"1","This place is very small and gets crowded very quickly. It is a frustrating experience every time I go in there. People are standing around since there is little seating and the line goes right into the dining area. Too small! They are also pretty slow at getting the food out to the customers which is surprising since it's just a bagel shop. Their coffee is terrible, too.\n\nThe actual food is good. I get the Lox and haven't been disappointed, I just hate going in there to get it."
"1","This location is a joke.   10:30am on a Saturday and out of all decent savory bagels to make a sandwich, line nearly to the door and barely moving, fountain machine not working, and less than friendly service.   I will make sure to choose a different location next time!"
"2","Love this place! Always order something different for food and everything I've had has been delish! But the real reason i go here: Cabo Wabo Margarita! yummy!"
"1","Hair in the salsa. What felt like a piece of sand in the deep fried cheese crisp. Refusal to let me order off the kids menu despite my recent surgery and documentation to support it -- you know because if an adult orders a kids sized portion (ie a normal portion) it will magically cost the restaurant more money. What the...?\n\nSeriously not worth it and I won't go back."
"2","This is my parent's Mexican restaurant of choice. I can see why. The portions are huge and everything is hot, fresh and tasty. \n\nHusband and I shared the crab and shrimp enchiladas, although it was a tough decision to make. Everything looked tempting. The enchiladas were quite good and definitely big enough to share. We both have big appetites but had taken advantage of the chips and salsa and ordered a quest dip for the table. The queso was rich and cheesey, served with flour tortilla chips - although I preferred the corn chips and used those to dip. \n\nIf in the area again I would like to try the pollo rico - I have a serious weakness for jalapeno cream cheese."
"2","Twice in the past year I have had a small business function catered by Nando's and I remain extremely impressed with their outstanding food and service.  DELICIOUS!!  Reasonably priced.  I will definitely order Nando's again for our next function."
"1","My wife and I both were first time customers to Val Vista Vision. Before going in I knew that I had monovision and a astigmastism. I knew that I could only get glasses, my wife though was told that she was a good candidate for contact lenses. Val Vista Vision charges $135 non-refundable fee. That fee went towards finding the correct contact, training and fitting for her. Her 1st pair (of contacts) my wife could not see distance or in low light level. She went in to see Dr. Stacie Eskew again and was told she had monovision. Dr. Eskew should have recognized this in the 1st exam. My wife went in several times to try different contacts and was told there no more options (she could not see distance in any of them) and she had to wear glasses. She asked since none of the contacts worked, to have partial of the $135 to go towards glasses and was told by contact lens specialist that they would not do that. We were disappointed, thinking Val Vista Vision would have better customer service than this. We will not return as customers or recommend them."
"1","Bad costumer service! I'm walking around for 15 minutes trying to find a shopping cart to put my little one in, and they are nowhere to be found, I finally ask one of the cashiers where I can find any and she was rude and said \"" we don't have anymore, or they are scattered everywhere\"" first of all as I was walking around I didn't see any and second I probably saw 7 carts total that people were using, so if that's the case they need to get more carts or have there extra employee just walking around start gathering them up...so frustrated! And it's not even busy!"
"1","I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!"
"1","We arrived on a Saturday morning at about 9:30. At the time it wasn't that busy, the restaurant was about half full and there was only one couple ahead of me at the counter when I ordered. I was there with my family of 4.\n\nThe Good\n - The restaurant was immaculate. Very clean and modern looking. Its a cool place.\n - The staff is very friendly. \n\nThe Bad\n - So... very.... slow....\nI'm not sure if she was new but the lady taking orders at the front counter was PAINFULLY slow. Watching her take the order of the couple of ahead of me was a lesson in patience. When it was my turn to place an order the experience was only slightly better.\n\nOnce my order was taken it took more than 10 minutes just to get our Cinnamon Roll.. and it was cold! They didnt even take a moment to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds.\n\nIt took another 15 plus minutes beyond that for us to get our breakfast. By that time it had been more than 25 minutes since I ordered and my kids were bouncing out of their chairs with boredom. Considering how slow it was when we placed our order that is just WAY TOO LONG to wait for food.\n\nThe Eh..\nThe food was alright. If I take into consideration it cost $30 dollars it was a pretty poor experience. But on its own merit, the food was no better than OK. My biscuits and gravy were cold, the pancakes might have been OK but the syrup was terrible. \n\nFrankly, given the standards for great food set by Joe's across the street I expected way better and next time I'll just wait in line for the Farmhouse next door."
"2","How do you start off a review when you're simply flabbergasted? Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review. \n      I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different. \n      Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a \""market\"" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night. \n      Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing \""Liberty Ale\"" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients. \n      We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best."
"2","I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant, and I love it.  Spent a lot of time and money there.  They even allowed us to have our small rehearsal dinner for our wedding there and it was FANTASTIC.\nPros: everything.  Food is great--ALWAYS.  People are great--ALWAYS.  They are friendly, attentive and enjoy being alive.  My favorite dish, the salmon BLT... HIGHLY recommend it.  It's fabulous.  Breakfast is also GREAT here.\nOnly thing you could complain about is it gets really busy, but that's what happens to good restaurants.\nThis is a must-visit restaurant... might become your favorite too!"
"2","Liberty market is fast becoming one of my favorite lunch time treats. They have a menu that while not huge seems to have something for everyone. I am in love with their white pizza. The bread is fabulous and while it has some unique ingredients(Arugula and pine nuts) they are not just their to be trendy they truly add to the flavor of the pizza. \n\nThe atmosphere is great and it is going to sound weird, but you should make a trip to the bathroom while you are there."
"1","Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \""garlic\"" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend."
"2","Was surprised by this restaurant mainly due to its Diner look from the outside but by the reco of most yelpers had to try it out. First of all the inside is definitely very modern and fun to look at. My wife and I came here for dinner and the food was very tasty. She had their Hamburger of the week which had a japanese fusion which she enjoyed very much. I had the Chicken sandwich and this was amazing the moment it hit my mouth. I know live very close to this restaurant and vow to come quite often and try everything on the menu.\n\nOnly reason it did not get 5 stars was because the elbow room is not very good here, tables are RIGHT next to each other. I understand you have to pack in as much as you can but it was difficult having a conversation wondering if the people next to you who are in the middle of chewing are listening in. Other than that great place."
"2","I came here the day before Christmas Eve with my family for dinner.  We came in 15 til 5 on a Sunday and were surprised how many tables were open... we were anticipating a possible wait, but my sister who comes here often had prepared us that if there was a wait, it would be worth every minute.  Everything was just so fresh.  My niece and nephew each got  a burger, my father got the spaghetti and meatballs, and my mom and sis got salads.  I had the picnic sandwich with potato salad.  It was awesome!  All homemade, and like I said, very fresh ingredients.  If you're looking for a five dollar footlong, this isn't the place to go.  The desserts looked AMAZING, but are SO big that I didn't have room.  This would be a good place to come with a friend and have coffee and split a dessert.  The environment fits it well too.  Very airy and fresh with a retro jet age feel to it, maybe from all the steel."
"2","Haven't reviewed this place in almost 2 years.  I should probably update!\n\nLiberty Market appears to be very popular, always busy. Some nights they have chef's specials.  Tonight was one of those nights, and that's what I ordered (the rib-eye).\n\nFirst, it was overpriced (probably the only reason not to give them 5 stars tonight).  But it was cooked perfectly, and had a nice sauce.  The accompanying potatoes and broccoli (from Agritopia) was very nice.  A solid four-star dish.\n\nThe others ordered a burger (with chips) and a pizza.  They seemed to enjoy them.  The prices on those were also a bit more reasonable.\n\nService was very good.  We were greeted several times between the door and the counter, and a woman I think was likely the owner checked on us later as well.\n\nThis remains one of our favorite American cuisine restaurants with a unique flare.  Not ostentatious or snooty.  A casual elegance."
"2","Liberty Market is my favorite place to get brunch in the area. I've had a handful of items off the menu, but, by far, my favorite two items are the  french toast and the breakfast burrito. \n\nFirst, the french toast. They have a different take on it so it is actually bread pudding. It's moist, sweet without being too sweet, and def some of the best french toast I've ever had. It's pretty much FLAWLESS. \n\nNext, the breakfast burrito. I'm usually not a huge fan of breakfast burritos, but this baby is def a winner. The sauces on top are far from bland and are what make the burrito so good. Of course the meat and potatoes inside add a lot, but the sauce is what truly makes it so spectacular. \n\nI've had a couple of other items off the menu such as the sandwiches (breakfast and lunch), pizza, and red velvet cake, but none are to rave about. However, if I was going to add another item to my meal, it'd be the cinnamon bun. Beware, it's quite large and only tastes good while warm."
"2","THE BEST PIZZA ANYWHERE !!! The owners are incredibly nice and put a lot of effort and pride in their business."
"1","Please do something about the employees there! Constantly smoking right outside the door so you have to smell it when walking in. Never doing anything behind the counter when you walk in, but too busy counting cigarrettes or whatever to help you pay. Ridiculousy long conversations with customers, or friends in the store, oh, free drinks form the fountain too if you know them. Apparantly are trading discounts with the nearby sushi place too. \n\nINFURIATING!"
"2","So I went to this place when I first moved over to this area and I liked it a lot. Then, for some reason, I thought I would try another shop in the area and, although it was pretty good, it was not awesome and it always seemed more expensive than it should be. \n\nSo I returned to Paulene's today and I certainly won't be changing again! \n\nI got a regular fill and I needed a toe nail fixed as I had an injured toe and half the nail came off while it was healing. I also got a deluxe pedicure that was pure heaven! She spent lots of time on me and they turned out beautifully!\n\nTheir service and the fact that they care about their work and their great pricing makes this an excellent nail salon."
"2","Cant beat it for a $5 lunch.  Great pizza, very fast service, clean establishment."
"1","Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare."
"1","Is it possible to give negative stars because if so I would! Do not come here ! I have had to come 3 times because eachtine they were not t"
"1","I'll start with the good.  Their coleslaw is fantastic, crisp and sweet and light with little bits of broccoli in it.  \nNow for the rest.  I went with two friends and my two children, one of which uses a high chair.  We walked in on a Monday afternoon and the place was about half full.  A waitress motioned from the back for us to sit at a round table so we did, picking up our own menus on the way.  And then we sat.  And sat.  My son squirmed around on my lap but I had nowhere to put him.  I watched two different waitresses walk by us repeatedly, even cleaning tables but not making eye contact. I finally flagged one down and she came over and said, \""You've been helped right?\""  We said no and she turned around and left.  A few minutes later a different waitress comes up, tells us we want coffee and seems put out when we ask for something else and sighs when I say I need a high chair.  5 more minutes go by and we get half the drinks.  Then a few minutes later the rest.  I can put up with lackluster service as long as the food is good and I had heard great things about this place so I held on to my patience.  I ordered the Long John with mushrooms.  Well, I can tell you that if I ever run out of hockey pucks for my local team, I know where to go.  It was almost inedible.  Dry, tough overcooked ground beef patty with a smattering of tasteless mushrooms topped with half melted cheese.  I actually asked for a side of ranch so I could dip it in that to make it moist enough to eat.  The waitress never asked how the food was, and we never saw her again after she ran my credit card.  \nI hope that this was just an off day but really the second star is only because of the coleslaw.  I will probably try it again if someone else wants to go, but overall not a winner in my book."
"2","Fantastic. Loved every part of my meal, huge portions, great drinks, and fairly priced. Its become the new place I like to show friends that visit from out of town. The biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge line I always see when I drive by but I went on a Sunday morning and there wasn't even a wait. Just have to pick the right days I guess."
"1","I've been here twice. First time was a couple years ago. It was pretty good. We decided to go for our anniversary. Monday morning, only 4 tables of customers. Nothing special about this restaurant. We asked the waitress if there were breakfasts with biscuits and gravy. She said no, you need to order the side, which was $5. Breakfast was overcooked, toast was burnt, nothing special about the French toast. $30 for two...not worth it. Outside...big specials sign showing exactly what I ordered with biscuits and gravy, just $5 cheaper. Biscuits were too soft, gravy had no flavor. I'm not sorry I accidentally left my leftovers."
"2","Goodness gracious, Flancer's is not for the light eater or the small stomach! \n\nIt took me far too long to stop into this tiny little shop considering that I live ever so close, and am always complaining about the lack of awesome food in this area.  The menu was so impressive that I had to have my server come back three times because I could not decide what to order! \n\nI ordered the BLTA with fries, and let me tell ya, I don't know how anyone gets through an entire sandwich.  I snarfed down the AMAZING fries, and half my delectable sandwich, and had to box the rest.  I could hardly get into my car, and don't tell anyone, but I definitely unbuttoned the ole' pants once I was out of public view.  OMG.\n\nMy one-star deduction is because upon arriving home, I flopped onto my bed for some rest because my stomach was working overtime on the BLTA, and next thing I knew, it was 3 a.m.!! I lost my entire evening to my sandwich.  \n\nAll discomfort aside, the food was outstanding, the prices were right for the quality of the meal, and I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu as soon as I can budget out the time to recover afterwards."
"2","We've been to Flancers many times and its always been great.  Its hard not to get the Philly Cheese-steak as it is *perfection*, but we've loved everything else we've ordered there too.  The place is very down to earth and could do with a makeover, but overall we really like it.  The staff is friendly and do a great job overall."
"2","I had heard a lot about Flancer's from the \""Mouth by Southwest\"" blog and was interested to try it.  I had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so I was excited to see what beers they had on tap.  All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.  \n\nThe sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.  I would love to try more of Flancer's sandwiches!"
"1","Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.\n\nMy biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list."
"1","Visited on Friday.  Ordered the Match with Hatch burger with jalapeno & cheddar potato pie on the side.  Presentation was good.  The burger was disappointing to be honest -- green chile was minimal (and not flavorful) and served luke warm.  The picture on the website and menu looks oh so much better.  The potato pie was good and had a bit of pizzazz to it that the burger lacked and was served hot.  Customer service was good and lots of \""regular customers\"" were about ordering.  I won't be back but given the regular clientele within, it probably satisfies many peoples tastes."
"2","Stopped in for a beer and to try something new for lunch. The staff was very friendly and patient with me looking over the menu. I took the waiters advice and decided to try the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of the green chili mac. Now, I was hesitant about this chicken sandwich.... I mean, prickly pear, what does that even mean? But take it from me... it is a must try. I brought the sandwich to my mouth and instantly feel in love. It is by far the most interesting chicken sandwich I've ever had. Is one of those things I can't explain WHY, all I can do is tell you that you will love it. The beer was great. The green chili mac was interesting as well, but delicious. I have just found my new favorite lunch spot."
"2","Just thought I'd help some customers out.\nI've worked here for almost 2 years now and what i notice is the thing that deters people the most is the price. So i thoght I'd help you guys out. For most basic custard without a topping, so like a single vanilla will run you around $2.13. Not that bad, but if you were to get 4 for eexample that'd be around $8.50. If we were to serve perfectly each time, 4 single scoops would be a pint which we actually do sell for around $5.06. If you dont mind sharing a cup and just using 4 spoons. But if you want some topping and a decent amount of custard which im sure you do. You will want to order the not so much ordered BANANA SPLIT! For $4.99 plus tax you get 3 scoops of custard,your choice, a banana (of course), 2 toppings, and a nut. That beats any custard item on our menu besides our Concrete which is also very good.\nNow for the Grinders. There isn't really a way around the price besides getting a job here and getting an employee discount. but let me tell you THEY ARE WORTH IT!\nWith fresh cut deli meats, fresh bread made from a recipe passed through generations, and their DELICIOUS and often misinterpeted pepper relish. These sandwhiches AKA Grinders are the best I've ever had. Although everyone has their preferences my favorite which is mostly customized is \""The Finer Turkey Bacon Melt Thingy!\"" (not on menu). which is a grinder with; turkey, bacon, avacado, cream cheese, swiss or provolgne cheese, Xtra Xtra pepper relish, and the other grinder things such as; lettuce, mayo, onion, tomato, and etc. If you were to order this it'd be pretty pricey but if you are prepared to have the most delicious sandwhich of your LIFE! Then you should try it. Ask Nick to make it, he knows how it's done!\n(additional notes: The Ownership was changed about 2 years ago and there has been some changes, There is no longer any soup. Sorry. Also i've been told that there was a menu with different combinations for custard, which we do not have, but we do have a large list of topping that you can choose from and virtually make any flavor your heart desires.)\nCome check us out our number is 480-981-6368 and we are on the South-west corner of Power and Baseline. I'd say we are a bit hard to find but don't give up we are just around the corner of GoodWill facing Baseline."
"2","Love burrito shack. Don't ever let the looks of it fool you. Great food, nice people and did I mention great food?!?!\n\nI was skeptical about going to the Burrito shack at first, but once I did I get it pretty often. I have not tried many things because I am stuck on one burrito because it is so good. The service is always friendly and even when the wait is long they still get your food to you as fast as possible and my order is always correct."
"2","They are AWESOME! Tammie the owner and her awesome assistant walked me through buying, having and maintaining chickens. I bought my chicken coop, a couple chicks, organic feed, water food and feed containers. That was a few months ago and things are great! I am so thankful for this feed store! Never been to better!"
"1","THEFT ALERT: \nWe just found out that thousands of dollars in tools that were stored in a 400 lb, thick steel box and secured to a trailer with kryptonite locks were stolen at this storage facility. We have been told the \""manager\"" will not be available until March 6 or 7th and that they are not responsible for the theft. Sadly this wasn't a quick theft as it must have taken a good amount of time to get this 400lb box off the trailer. The Store More website claims a very secure facility as well as surveillance monitors. According to the employee \""there are no cameras in that area\"". The loss of our items doesn't appear to be much of a concern to this company which is why I will be doing my best to make sure everyone in the Queen Creek area is aware of this situation. We understand that Store More can't be responsible for every theft, however the website should not say this is a secure facility with surveillance cameras if there aren't any. We are very disappointed not only about the lack of security but by how we were treated."
"1","Everyone should eat here if they want to get really bad Food Poisoning and almost die!!!!"
"1","Typical greasy spoon. Dive looking, average cooking and friendly staff."
"1","Several friends and I drove from Surprise, AZ to the annual Peach Festival at Schnepf Farms.  We have done this many times, but this was the last time we will ever attend.  The first obstacle was the slow moving traffic on Rittenhouse Road causing us to creep along for 45 minutes to complete the last 2 miles of the trip.  There were 5 Sheriff's Police cars there, but they seemed to do nothing to help.  We got in finally and for the first time did not have to wait long to have our pancake breakfast.  We then tried to buy peaches, but that was almost impossible, They only brought in peaches from the orchard every 1/2 hour to sell.  We had to wait in line in the direct sun and there was only one cashier for a crowd of hundreds.  The store had one cashier too.  No signs or directions.  We were so disappointed we are never going back again.  This festival has been going on for years why was it so poorly organized???\n\n We went down to the Queen Creek Olive Mill and enjoyed the air conditioning, a cool beverage, and bought several items."
"2","My husband and I took our four kids to the peach festival at Schnepf Farms in May. I probably won't go back again for the peach festival, but I will definitely return to get fruits and veggies. The farm itself is great. I love that you can rent bicycles to ride around the huge property. The peaches we picked were delicious and pesticide free."
"2","I am an Arizona native with four kids and LOVE Schnepf Farms.  My oldest son is 20 and we have been bringing our kids to this farm every October since he was four years old.  My 17 year old twins and 13 year old have been going their since they were born.  It is a wonderful family experience and tradition.  It is always exciting to see what new things they add each year.  Last year my husband and teenagers went on the roller coaster about 8 times.  This year my twins are working at the farm learning working skills, customer service and teamwork.  How wonderful that the owners give back to the community in which their farm resides.  It is sad that there are complaints about the cost, this is the only time of year there is an admission fee and entertainment always has a price.  Arizona in October has beautiful weather and adults and children alike can enjoy the walks, food, entertainment and other things to do.  Lots of fun activities for children and adults.  How wonderful to have a local operating farm in our area.  As our children grow and grandchildren are born, I can't wait to continue the tradition with them.  Thank you Carrie Schnepf and family for this gem in Queen Creek.  We are grateful for your contributions."
"1","I went by this location for lunch today, only to see a big CLOSED sign by the entrance.  Other cars came in too so I'm assuming it recently shut down.  I had lunch there 2 weeks ago.  The sign said that the Gilbert location was still open."
"1","Went in today and asked for John, my mechanic.  They said he no longer works there.  Wouldn't trust the rest of them to work on my daughter's PowerWheel."
"1","The service was so bad, we never even got to order. The waitress asked for our order after about 5 minutes but we weren't quite ready and she never came back despite our attempts to get her attention. 20 minutes later we left and as soon as we were out the door she was cleaning up our table. We will not be back."
"1","I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25% just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this. \n\nService was unsatisfactory. We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter.  When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress. \n\nThe meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date. \n\nDo not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment. \n\nEat here if you want to punish yourself."
"1","I waited in line for 27 min just to buy 2 pool rafts!!!! There were 2 employees working the counter and they were in absolutely no rush to get the lines down!! \nOn a positive note, they were extremely polite and did have great attitudes. I was upset waiting in line for so long but they do make you feel better when you are being helped."
"1","Have you ever walked into a place of business and you feel like you walked in the back door that the employees use... or maybe before the place was officially open for the day but the door was unlocked? Well, that is how I felt when I walked in here. I don't know if everyone was just busy working on a project or just a bad day but that is how I felt that day.\n\nNow when they finally did realize I was there I asked them if they had what I wanted. They did not so I took off so I don't have a TON of stuff to say about the place. I just felt that the place catered to BMX type bikes and I was that idiot that walked in that didn't know **** about bikes and was wasting their time. Oddly enough, at the time I was quite into biking.\n\nMy experience here is being compared to Performance Bike.\n\nBut then again, maybe they were closed and I walked in the wrong door?"
"1","Very disappointing. We should've known by the yelp reviews, but figured we'd give it a try anyways. The TV in our booth was nice, but not enough to compensate for the bland, over cooked food and server with an attitude. Sidelines of Chandler was NOTHING like our beloved Sidelines of Brunswick Ohio! Will not be back."
"2","The food is excellent and the delivery service is outstanding.  They handle everything with a smile. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't found anything that wasn't good."
"2","It was our first time there, and we will be going back! The portion sizes were good, my jumbo shrimp really were jumbo! The combo meals are perfect! They come with an entree, fried rice, a crab wonton and a spring roll. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food. We left satisfied! Also the server was super friendly and attentive!"
"1","Would give 0 stars if I could! I used to tan at the location at greenfield and brown. The owner closed the doors without notice!!!!! I had units and $115 lotion that I will never see again.  Trying to get help has been like pulling teeth. \nThis was a response I received!  DO NOT TAN HERE!!!!!!!!!"
"2","Steve at Spotless carpet care does a fantastic job, my carpets & large sectional look as good as new and I love the smell that is in the solution, really freshens up the house! I highly recommend Spotless Carpet Care"
"1","I will suggest anyone to take your business from this location. Do not trust this location with you expensive clothes. They will ruin your expensive clothes.\n\nDelia cleaners claim to have a system in place to manage customer requests which is through a computer system and give you a blue color bag which they claim will have all notes attached in their computer system by having a unique number assigned to each customer. \n\nThey placed center crease on (4) of my dockers 4th time inspite of my repeated reminders on top of providing them clear instructions to treat my clothes as per my criteria while setting up my account as well. Might be they have system in place, ultimately people have to follow quality assurance . \n\nQuality assurance trickle down from top management how cautious they are about taking care of customer needs. By just providing lip service that they have system in place and then ruining customer clothes does not make sense. It tell me it is management lacking an interest in serving customers, rather they are just focused on getting clients money and focused on their profits without having any consideration for their clients. They have horrible service. On top seems to not care a bit to resolve this. \n\nSuccessful co's are build upon client's trusting their vendor or service providers. Do not trust these guys! \n\nInspite of multiple requests to store associates to have store manager and or either management call me, no one have called me to resolve this matter. Now  have to go an buy new pants, as they are 100% cotton pants once center crease is place by heating systems it is hard to get that crease off. \n\nI had travel arrangements and now had to spend time to source my clothings for a trip on top of posting these comments to caution other's how badly Delia cleaners at Alma school location in Chandler, Arizona treat their Clients!!!! Very bad service ."
"2","This is the best wedding venue ever!\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have booked our wedding here for May and already I'm in love with everything it has to offer. \nThe have an amazing package deal which includes everything but the officiant, photographer, and alcohol. But even so, the fabulous coordinators there will glady give you recommendations for these services.\nThe planning process is so easy as they take care of mostly everything, you just tell them your preferences. They offer tasting events for the food and different meetings to talk about florals and linens. They completely take away the stress from the planning of your event.\nThe food, linens and vendors they use are first class. I can't wait for my wedding now!!!! I fall in love with it more and more everyday! Thank you Ashley Manor!\nI highly recommend this venue for your wedding or event! Very happy with everything they have to offer."
"2","Awesome pizza for delivery. Top choice over pizza hut, dominos or any other pick up or delivery place. Prices are good too. They said it would be an hour but it got there in 30 min, no complaints with that."
"1","Disgusting. Ordered a double whopper which was inedible. I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it. But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn't take it anymore. Don't bother visiting this location. Disgusting waste of money. Sad, cause I used to love the whopper."
"2","This is such an amazing park in Scottsdale, especially considering it's city ran. My little train fanatics loved it because there were, \""choo-choo\"" signals, a tunnel and a cool Western themed park to play at after. The price was right; I spent $9 for myself and my family to ride the train and the carousel (my 2 year old was free).  We spent about 2 hours there, would have been more if the weather was nicer.  \n\nThis park also has a little general store where we picked up some ice cream cones and Icee's after our ride.  Beware of the Thomas section though!! :)"
"2","i always enjoy the concerts on Sunday evenings!  Great concessions and clean park to enjoy friends, family and music.  This is a great park to host any occasion for any age group."
"2","Great place!  Playground, train rides were inexpensive,   museums had wonderful kid activated trains, cheap snacks, building and grounds were well maintained.  Areas for Birthday parties and picnics.  Wonderful day for family."
"1","Complete and total lack of customer service.\n\nThey want you money and that's all ....\n\nI won't be back"
"1","I love Paradise Bakery, just not this one. On too many occasions have they messed up my order or not had key ingredients for main sandwhiches. I keep returning based on convenient location to my home but no more. \n\nSave your money for another location or different restaurant."
"1","Decided to stop by here (for the first time) last week for a quick fix. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but this was not up to par with the consistency that I would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant. In fact, both my Big Mac and my girlfriend's were surprising dry! I'm sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them! To top it off, we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries (the french fry containers were not overflowing full as I'm used to getting from other Mickey Dee's). \n\nAlso, since they were new and for a \""limited time\"" (and thank the man upstairs for that), we tried out the McBites instead of our usual McNuggets, only to find ourselves in utter disappointment. The McBites were super dry and very hard with very little meat to be found. They were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp. I'm not sure if I'd ever give this location a try again, there were just too many strikes in one instance. Moreover, we went through the drive-thru so it's not like we could've complained to the manager if we ate inside. Overall, this was a bad first impression at this location."
"1","filled with flies everywhere, not matter if it is in a nice area, it is still covered with flies.\nIt is zoo bad, it is on your food and walls and everywhere."
"1","Not good.  Minimum amount is done for the $ 19.99 wash.   Seats were not wiped down, no armor all done or rain ex for that price.  Vacuuming was also poor.  Will avoid in future. \nFor the $19.99 wash they do not amor all the tires or give it that extra clean that other car washes provide."
"1","Horrible customer service.  I just watched the man in front of me get treated like crap over a $1 additional charge.  The cashier was dismissive and flat out rude.  I won't be coming back here and neither will that man.  She just lost this business 2 customers over $1 and her bad attitude.   The quality of the wash was decent hence the 2 stars."
"1","Scum bag owners. Worst customers service ever. \nOne owner Jorge Lolpez tried over charge fuel+carwash for drop off\nhaul's truck.... I called the company for complain about this jerk guy\nwith attitude and I change drop off the truck in different location with\nno charge. Don't go here this guy don't deserve any kind business."
"2","We recently purchased a new home, and consequently, needed a lot of lamps.  We'd driven by this store many times without really paying much attention to it until now.  Upon going in, we realized that their prices are a bit higher.... if you're looking for just a lamp to get by, Home Depot or Target will probably do the job.  But for something that will last and is more of a quality, eye-catching addition to the room, Lamps Plus is the route to go. \n\nEvery time we've been in, the salespeople have been helpful and friendly.  One of the many (10+) lamps we bought was defective and couldn't be assembled.  I brought it back the next day (with the receipt) and had no problems exchanging it.  No problems to speak of on our end."
"2","Great food, good service."
"1","I used to frequent this place 7 years ago, moved away, and went back again last night. The service is still efficient and good, however the noise level in the dining area is very high. If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing meal, this is not the place. \n\nLet's start with the good stuff. The complimentary bread comes out crusty and hot and the flavored spreads were delicious!  The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and arugula with a balsamic dressing was slightly overdressed, but amazing! The little hint of fresh mint in the dressing takes it over the top! The clam chowder was very good. We also had the molten lava cake and crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which were both good, but not exceptional.\n\nNow to the big disappointment. We both had the rib eye steak, medium rare. The seasoning was good, but the outside wasn't crusted or charred enough. The cut of meat was hard to eat with bite after bite of gristle and too much fat. Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short. Where's the beef?!!"
"1","Oops this review was for Peoria location. Delete"
"1","I've had WAYYYY better experiences. We chose this place based on their location to the Salt River Fields for Spring Training.\n\nWe called ahead of time to see if they could handle 3 pedicures & 1 manicure at the same time. They said \""Yes, come on in.\"" Um, no. There were only 3 ladies working, and one was already busy. What should have been a 45 minute trip to the nail place, ended up being an hour and half!\n\nThe ladies here are not friendly, and they are slow. My toes look like I could have painted them myself. They severely lack color options for regular polish and gel. The space is average -- clean and newer pedicure stations, but the seats were not very comfortable. I would not come back again nor recommend to a friend."
"2","Great pizza and wings! The polish sausage's are the best and their hot roast beef sandwiches are awesome! If you are ever around McDonald & Granite Reef in Scottsdale you have try this place! You'll love it!"
"2","Like Home Depot this is a toy store for big boys.  While they have much the same as any other hardware store, some items are different brands. The staff was very friendly making our trip very pleasent."
"1","Terrible customer service!! Went in at 7:30 in the morning and it was not busy at all. Staff was very unfriendly and quick to just point you in the direction of items we were looking for and then turn around and go back to their task or paperwork. Not helpful!! Lynn was the only one that was pleasant enough to speak with us and offer advice on a project we are working on. Everyone else was just walking by, head down, moving slow. Perhaps they need to offer their staff COFFEE to WAKE them UP at their morning meeting! Oh, and take some happy pills while you're at it, too!\n\nSelection on what we needed was poor, too!\n\nAND they cut my key wrong a few days ago. I ended up going to a Lowes near my work...Happy Valley. The customer service at the Happy Valley location was far superior and what I expected from them. Go to the Happy Valley location for excellent customer service...Ryan was super helpful in the key department!!! For something so small as getting a key re-cut, you could tell he cared about his customers!"
"1","Like another reviewer here we made the mistake of buying an appliance from them (dishwasher). Both my wife and I made it clear that we wanted it installed and the Lowe's salesman made it clear to us that they would install it when they delivered it. We waited two weeks for the delivery only to be told by the delivery guys when they arrived that they don't do installations. \n\nWe had them take the dishwasher back; we'll do our shopping elsewhere.\n\nSeems like the reviews here for Lowe's are either hot or cold and there's no middle ground. We rolled the dice and lost."
"1","I wish there was a 0-star Rating here, because he deserves it!\n\nI dropped my watch off for repair 3 months ago and I have not seen it since. He keeps telling me that his \""watch guy\"" hasn't brought it back. Or, his watch guy has been out of town. Or, he will check with his watch guy and call me later in the day, which he never does. At this point, I will give up on my $100 watch just so I don't have to hear any more of his lies. DO NOT GO HERE under any circumstances! I also find it strange that no one else is ever in the store when I go in. Ever. Something strange is going on here."
"2","Good service. The daughter works the front and she is nice and works hard to make sure the restaurant runs well and is clean. \nThe food is really good for AZ/MEX. Cheap. Carne Asada burrito is very good. Also, the beans are authentic. One of the best breakfast burritos around. \nNow, some people knock the location and decor. Well, I don't eat either one so I'l leave that to other raters ( my friends say I can eat a lounge chair in less than a minute). \nNice people and quick to get your order out. Recommended by this mexican food aficionado."
"1","The food was just okay, I have had much better from many taco joints.  I am rather bummed because this place is not far from where I live.  \n\nMy sister and I ordered chicken, carnitas, and carne asada tacos to share.  The carne asada was the best of the 3, but nothing to write home to mom about.  The carnitas was overcooked and crispy/burnt/dry.  The chicken taco was pretty good, but again nothing exciting.  The sauces (green and red salsa) were not very spicy and rather blah.  I can say the service was very fast and the prices were cheap.  Most of the tables were not cleaned off in the restaurant.  Also, we ordered everything without guacamole and that seems to be their claim to fame, so maybe we are a bit biased and missing out on the key ingredient.  \n\nI will be back if I am in desperate need of a taco nearby, but I will hopefully find a better place before that desperate moment occurs."
"2","As I've said before, I typically  don't  bother writing a review when there is already a voluminous set of other reviews stating everything I'd want to, and more concisely than I could... but Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in the valley, so I'm still going to add my two cents.\n\nI've never had a bad meal at Sakana. Even when busy, which seems to be more often than not as of late, the service is good, the prices are decent and the portions huge.\n\nRecently, they started having a Monday night happy hour-ish menu offering discounted maki rolls that include lettuce in the place of avocado. I've also seen promotions offering appetizers for 0.50 when you buy a Kirin or Kirin Light. Oh yeah, last but not least, you get orange slices with your bill... which is a nice touch."
"2","A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the \""main\"" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.\n\n$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.\n\nBeers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.\n\nCan you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!"
"1","I never thought I'd be giving my go to sushi joint 2 stars, but alas I am.  It's sad but true, over the past year I've watched Sakana slip. I'm not sure what happened to the little neighborhood sushi place that was once \""authentic\"".\n\nLast night was the last straw.  Like always I ordered a house salad that at one time was chalk full of tomatoes, fresh sliced mushrooms and a delightful ginger dressing.  This was not the case last night.  There was ONE sliced tomato and no mushrooms . The gingery dressing that I once loved has now been converted into the salty, orange mess.  I tried to eat it but after I felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload, I stopped. \n\nNext came the sushi.  We ordered 3 different rolls; soft shell crab, Tootsie, and a spicy tuna.  They were all wrapped so loose that it made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I hate when I see people eating sushi with their hands, but last night I was one of those people.  I tasted one of the spicy tuna rolls and decided it was best not eat another one.  It tasted....fishy.....and anyone sushi eater knows that when fish tastes fishy, its bad news.\n\nOn a good note, the server was very nice. She took spicy tuna off the bill since we had only consumed one. She also offered free dessert but we declined and left.  I hate to say it but I will probably not return. \n\nOh, and did I mention we also had the pleasure of listening to Justin Bieber while we dined.  If I wanted to hang around sake bombing 19 year olds I would have gone to RA. Sorry Sakana."
"1","I don't know how this place got a 4-star average.  We showed up later in the evening, but they were still open and seating.  Out of 4 rolls, one was good.  The other three were pretty disgusting.  They were made sloppily, everything had TONS of mayo and not enough spice.  They smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon, which leads me to believe it's not very fresh, and it makes for a very mushy texture.\n\nThe miso soup was good, at least...\n\nAnyway, they turned on the bright lights and started stacking chairs before we had finished paying.  Sorta rude.  As a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time, I think that if you take tables until 9:30, you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finished.  Otherwise close earlier and don't take the table.\n\nI'm NEVER going back here,  Ew."
"2","My \""go to\"" place for Sushi.  Great rolls, busy yet fun atmosophere, and you can't beat the M-Thursday specials.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the waitstaff.  Some are a little forgetful but they are always polite and friendly.  Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."
"1","\""I'm sorry you feel that way\"" is often used to dismiss a woman's opinion or thought. It's an attempt to silence her. So not only does your sushi suck you try to silence  your customers that are taking their time to provide constructive criticism in a form of a review.\n\nThe sushi that I had was not fresh. Others have reviewed that their sushi was NOT fresh. If multiple people are saying your seafood is not fresh then it is not fresh. \n\nI was born in and spent a lot of my life in a fishing village off the Mediterranean Sea with a family full of fishermen. I also served in the United States Coast Guard and served in Boston and and more than aware of the seafood coming from there and how it should look like. I am more than qualified to know what fresh seafood is and what is not. I am also qualified to know what is real seafood and what is not. Imitation crab meat is NOT real seafood.\n\nI even took into consideration and lowered my standards a bit cause we are--after all in the desert.  Your sushi was not even \""fresh for Arizona\""."
"1","Customer Service Sucks at this golf course soooooooo BAD!  Been there 4 times and every time have an issue checking in or with one of the GOLF Pros.  This golf course by far has the worst employees ever. The course is usally in good condition but always get turned off by the employees. On top of it all they do not even have a driving range to practice. Do not recommend this course at all."
"2","I love this place. Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. \nTheir pastrami is the best in the state, and their turkey that is used in sandwiches tastes real (as in NOT the watery deli stuff you find in most places). They did get rid of my favorite \""sandwich\"",  the El Paso Wrap, but I've found they'll still make it for me when I get a craving for it. The chicken soups are delish and home made (and wonderful when you are sick with the flu or a cold). \nNeedless to say, their bagels are killer. \nFrequently a line, but worth the wait, if you have the time. \nHighly recommend this place!!"
"2","Very good bagels and sandwiches!"
"2","Great service, even for a busy Saturday.  Our server was a grandmother too, which was really cool.  Food was above average but nothing great.  Bread/toast was good, pancakes I can't understand why they're popular, and actually the Southwest breakfasts were rather good - breakfast enchiladas, for example.  Popular spot, and I can see why."
"2","Best bakery in town! Feels like new York"
"1","First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. \n\nI went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. \n\nShe tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.\n\nThey need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business."
"1","Coming from Michigan which has one or two outstanding Deli's, Chompie's was a huge disappointment.  Their corned beef was lousy compared to Vienna brand.  Their prices are beyond ridiculous.  I will continue my search for a good Jewish Deli in Arizona."
"1","I really don't want to give a bad review of this place, but they don't seem to have the same standards for the take-out orders that they do for their dine-ins.\n\nDine ins are great, the food is always excellent. \n\nI've been ordering take out lately and there's always been a problem with my order. \n\nI get the Cabo skillet with homefries, and they keep not including the salsa and sour cream condiments. Today, I didn't get the melted jack cheese on my skillet, which completely killed the meal for me and was the last straw, which is why I'm writing this review. \n\nThey also made my home fries hash browns instead, which were underseasoned and undercooked .\n\nQuite a shame because I get nothing but the cabo skillet and its usually been excellent without any of these problems when I dine in. \n\nI ordered a different skilled and asked for scrambled eggs, instead I got overcooked fried eggs which also killed the entree. \n\n\nI'm going to give them another chance next week, and if the same problem presists I'll probably stop eating here again."
"2","The year: 2010.\n  \nThe episode: \""Phoenix.\""\n\nThe Man: Adam Richman, himself.\n\nThe Challenge: Chompie's \""The Ultimate Slider Challenge.\""\n\n...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.\n\n...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's \""Hall of Fame\"" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an \""Ultimate Slider Challenge\"" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?\n\nThis having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were \""deli-icious.\""  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?\n\nSo, \""Man vs Food\""...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.\n\n=]"
"2","This is one of the best NY style deli's I have been to! The sandwiches are ginormous and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the meat! I would recommend this place even to the pickiest New Yorkers. They also have a breakfast that is bomb dot com!"
"1","Oh my goodness. I haven't had a good experience with Chompie's lately and it's not just this location. The service is ALWAYS a hit or miss. I walked in last week when it was pretty slow and the two ladies standing around at the front didn't even say a simple \""hello\"". I asked them if we had to wait to be seated and without answering, they looked at each other with a smirk and nodded at the hostess to \""take care of us\"". \n\nNot the most welcoming feeling. When a customer asks you question, you answer their question. Simple as that. I've been in the restaurant industry for awhile and I would never \""blow off\"" or make my customers feel unwelcome the minute they walk in. \n\nOur server was alright, except for the fact we didn't get a single drink refill until she handed us our check...which implies that she didn't stop by to check on us at all. But hey, at least the food was on point."
"1","Used to come here all the time in the past (few years ago) and the tong sandwich was always great.  However, came back over the Thanksgiving holiday this year to get my tong sandwich fix while back in town, and the meat was over cooked and dry.  May have just been an off night for Compies, but this meal was a 1 out of 5."
"1","This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu."
"2","Let me sum this up: I liked the way I looked.\n\nI needed to rent a tux for a black tie wedding in about two weeks. Came in and was quickly greeted by younger looking employees who were very friendly but slightly unpolished. When I think of suits, I think of older gentlemen, preferably with accents and finely coiffed beards. Nevertheless, the young lady working the computer pointed out various shapes, sizes and selections for my tux. She ascertained my budget and attempted to fit it. Despite my ignorance, she guided me through the process of accessorizing appropriately for the style I wanted. They took my measurements and told me to come back a couple days before the wedding.\n\nTo my satisfaction, the tux came in early! Everything fit perfectly and I walked out a happy and prepared man.\n\nPolicy states that you must return the tux (in one piece) the day following the event. The nice thing is, ANY Men's Wearhouse will accept back your partially soiled attire. I made sure not to lose pieces and avoided any penalties.\n\nThe whole rental cost me about $120 (including deposit). Pricey, maybe. But, consider all the free food and drink at the wedding! And after all, isn't looking awesome, priceless?\n\nTuxedo Renting Tips:\n-If you choose suspenders, do it for function. No one will actually see them... unless you want them to.\n-Don't forget to brush off those nice cufflinks you got as a grad present years ago. Otherwise, you're stuck with the free ones they include.\n-Bow-ties are cool. The ones they give you are clip-on. Unless you're really good at tying one, opt for the clip-on."
"1","Our party of four met at Houston's for a late lunch this week.  The service was excellent and the food was very good, though over priced ($14 for a small plate of veggies? ), but we all left with the same complaint, \""Why do they play such loud music?!\""   We could barely hear each other despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty.    The ambiance of Houston's seemed to conflict with loud music overhead -- I won't be back, even if eating alone."
"1","Got me usually good food.Placed was packed.Steak was average and French fries cold.Service was fine."
"2","Definitely call ahead for a reservation.  We were out and decided to eat her since it was near by.  The wait was long for a table but everywhere would have had a wait on a Saturday night.  the food was really good as expected for a steak house of this caliber.  Would I wait again,  probably not. . Would I eat here again,  definitely buy only with a reservation."
"1","My wife and I have been going to Houston's for about 5 years, as time goes bye Houston's service/ food has really taken a back seat to the quality food/service we were used to. The last two times for dinner my wife and I love the prime rib French dip we were told both times they were sold out of the prime rib, so we opted for the Hawaiian steak(yuk) ask for medium rare it was over cooked n the taste was awful, as we were choking down the Hawaiian steak we watched waiter after waiter serving the same prime rib French dip to customers after we have almost finished are dinner, The service the last two times there has been just terrible, I know I won't be back, to all u Houston lovers enjoy, but don't settle for less like I did, Houston's has gone down hill, peace, John"
"1","What a terrible experience.  I love Houston's and there are very few restaurant chains that I can say that about.  I look forward to going to a Houston's any time I can.  We went into this one on a Friday evening, February 21st of this year.  It was later in the evening but we were just going to have a drink at the bar and perhaps a snack.  We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \""sorry we are closing and so longer serving\"".  Again- the place was packed and people were still waiting for their dinners!  I know the difference between stopped seating vs stopped serving!  She was so fricking rude that it has stuck with me these past four months!  We explained we were just looking to have a drink and maybe a snack but couldn't even get the sentence out before she shut us down again.  Clearly she had after work plans or took a cranky pill but one this is clear- she should NOT be behind the bar at This or any other decent restaurant!  She has a very bright future down at the DMV however.  Thanks for trying to kill our evening Ms Sunshine!"
"1","I used to LOVE this restaurant, but after some recent experiences, I plan to take my business elsewhere.\n\nTheir service remains excellent, but food quality has seriously soured.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken salad (chicken on the side since I am vegetarian), which they accommodated.  My mom and I split this along with a side of french fries.  The salad used to be so big I could eat and eat and eat and not make a dent.  We devoured this one quickly.  The carrots are in chunks instead of shredded and there are too many tortilla strips.  The greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy.  My mom enjoyed the chicken and the amount they provided.\n\nThe fries were disappointing.  They have changed the potatoes so they are much chunkier (not the shoestring yumminess it used to be) and the flavor is more comparable to fast food than to anything worth of a seated restaurant.  I didn't even eat them and decided to fill up at home instead.  Our server did take the fries off the bill after we mentioned how different they were.  We were told that they were changed for quality, but I am positive it must be a cost issue.\n\nI would go to the bar for a glass of wine as I still like the ambiance and service, but the food is not up to par anymore.  I have other restaurants that are tastier."
"1","Bought a hat and some other things.  Got home and discovered that the hat was rung up twice, not such a good deal after all.\nCame back with the receipt showing the double charge and the surly manager explains they would have to check their surveillance video, etc., all for $7.\nWe'll not be back."
"2","They did the best color I've ever had and they were able to take me the same day I called in. The prices are very reasonable considering how good the service is. I'd reccomend anyone to this spa!"
"2","I have to be honest, I never look forward to getting waxed, but at least when I do, I can enjoy the Lamar while I'm at it.  This place is great, it's exactly what a spa should be: clean, comfortable, and calming.  \n\nAll the staff are super friendly and good at what they do...Ellen in particular, I always leave happy and satisfied when I get a wax or facial from her.  \n\nThey frequently run specials too, which is nice, you just have to get on their mailing list.  If you're in the scottsdale area, be sure to book an appointment here."
"2","I love that I found my go-to scottsdale spa!  Racheal does my hair (cut and highlights) and she is amazing, I wouldn't go anywhere or to anyone else.  I love that they have a ton of amenities (including a small pool!) so everytime I go, I can spend as much time as I want there.  They offer small snacks and tea/water and the staff is just so friendly and inviting.  Definitely would recommend Spa Lamar to anyone looking for a relaxing, enjoyable  spa day. Two thumbs up!!"
"2","Stayed there for a few days for work and had a great time. \n\nPros - Nice rooms, super friendly staff (except the man in the gift shop who was strange and kind of rude), food was excellent in the restaurant, Starbucks onsite and of course, the outdoor hot tubs.\n\nCons - There's not really much around the resort except for other resorts.\n\nAs I was there for work, I didn't pay for it so couldn't say whether it was good value or not."
"1","Beautiful pools are the only thing going for this place.  The reception staff is slow and not especially friendly. The rooms are drab.  In a resort, I expect atmosphere and a sense of place. There was none. The fruit basket I preordered for delivery at check in was never delivered. The availability of service at the restaurant and bar were spotty at best and again not very friendly. Weddings are the priority here and twice during my stay, the staff put me aside so brides could walk in front of me at the reception desk to be served first. \n\nOn the last night of my stay I came home after a full day out to find my room door ajar. The room was serviced in my absence and one of the staff had not taken the care to properly close my door. My room faced a parking lot and busy Scottsdale Ave. I reported this and got assurances that no one had ever had anything stolen from their room before. Fortunately I did not have anything stolen. \n\nI had prepaid for late check out on arrival. On my final day, I returned to my room to find my room keys had been deactivated at the normal check out time. I went to the desk to get them reactivated. Even though the front desk verbally confirmed my late check out when I first arrived and registered, that had now mysteriously disappeared. The room key cards were fixed and I returned to my room to find an un-uniformed staff member milling around my room. She didn't even greet me. Instead she glared at me and barked \""when are you leaving?\"". I told her I had late check out and she stormed out of my room without another word. \n\nTerrible staff, terrible location and terrible rooms. This place is a glorified motel. I hope I never set eyes on this place again. It is not worthy of the Hilton or Doubletree name."
"2","Happy almost Halloween!\n\nI procrastinated again this year and the day before a costume party, I realized I needed something to wear...\n\nI gave Mardi Gras a shot and they came through in a pinch!  Actually, it was Christy who came through to help Jared and I find costumes.  She helped us navigate through the store, gave us opinions and suggestions, and voila... we walked out with costumes!\n\nMardi Gras has costumes for rent and purchase.  They carry all kinds of make-up, masks, mustaches, wigs, shoes, accessories, etc.  They squeeze a hell of a lot of stuff into their store!  They are a tad bit pricey and a tad bit crowded right about now, but what costume shop isn't?\n\nI'll for sure return to Mardi Gras for future costume needs!"
"1","I talked to the owner to request a 1 hour donation to deliver a cake for a 4 year old little girl in hospice. The owner was extremely rude and claimed that he gave to charity often and doubted the validity of my story. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"1","We used to have a storage unit with Storage Max.  Storage Max has an EXTREMELY rude staff, from our experience.  They do not accept credit cards and will only accept checks or cash.  So do not even think of setting up an automatic payment plan.  Also be aware that your belongings may be exposed to some dust from dust storms, as ours were.  Which never happened in our previous experiences from renting storage units.\n\nThe prices are the cheapest you can find in Scottsdale, and the saying was true to us, remember, you get what you pay for."
"1","Everytime I go into this store, there is only one cashier working but yet several employees meandering around?  Today was the same!!  But the worst was the POOR customer service I received.  I used to love this store as they do have a large variety of kids toys etc. After my freadful experience today, I wil never walk through those doors again.  Waiting over 20 mins in check out line is not acceptable."
"1","The Hotel is in the best possible location for walkable restaurants and Scottsdale Rd. is the heart of everything.  If feels like a Hilton, the Ambassador, James, should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for being himself and the concierge is just as kind. \n The Spa was small but accommodating.  The Jr. Suite on the second floor is spacious and the bed is just what the doctor ordered.  Sleep was sound and comfortable, A/C not loud and the creaky ceilings reported in previous reviews was not a problem.\n\nI've placed the \""trouble\"" part down here where management will read it but most Yelpers won't bother so this is your \""gimme\"" managers!\n\nThe trouble:  We noticed a wet, funky smell coming from the hallway and the buckled carpets implied a water problem and after returning from a day hiking we noticed our room smelled like old cheese.  We reported the problem to the front desk and she offered a similar room on the bottom floor sans funky smell but it wasn't the same. Then she offered to have maintenance come up and \""spray\"" the room.  This is the comment that prompted 2 stars. You don't offer to \""spray\"" a room that a customer has willingly paid $200 a night for three nights! \n\n Hilton, you can do better than this or maybe you've changed your protocol for pursuing the Gold standard?  With people like James in the Lobby and Tom in the Wellness Center, why skimp on the training for the front desk on Monday night?  Suggestion: Give the staff the authority to proactively explain why the floor is buckled and smells like old sewer and beg our pardon with anything positive, perhaps a breakfast or a discount on the next stay or even, god forbid, an upgrade to a nicer room that is unoccupied for the next few nights. \n\nThat extra bit of training would have been worth it and an extra 2 stars!"
"1","There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them."
"1","Too bad, so sad.....this smaller market chain needs to jump into high gear with employee training if they're gonna stay in the game. I like having a smaller canvas of grocery aisles sometimes....not every store needs to be SUPERsize....but this store is right down the street from a Safeway, a Wal-Mart SuperStore, and a Fry's....these stores all have way more variety and efficient systems and employees. It's just my humble opinion, but if I can get in and out of a 22-aisle market faster than a 14-aisle market, there is something worth looking into by the management."
"1","This store is right near our house, so I run in often.  It's pretty lacking in the features of a grocery store:\n\n- service is terrible - the cashiers are super slow, confused and sometimes disheveled.  \n- the self-checkout machines have an issue just about every time.  i use these everywhere i can, typically with great success....and the attendant is usually nowhere to be found.  When they finally arrive, they're confused and slow.  \n- the selection is paltry - they have pretty obvious things but don't expect many brand choices, options, etc.\n- the prices are a bit steep, compared to bigger, nicer stores, plus they don't seem to have a lot of sale items\n- the produce is pretty terrible.  the guy who works in that department will cheerfully help you pick a pineapple, though.\n\nIn summary, if you don't live just down the street, avoid this place."
"1","THEY MADE QUACKING-TALK TO MUCH HAND GESTURES TO MY FACE!\n   \nI took my cashmere wool blend coat to Celebrity Drycleaners.  Because of the cashmere blend, I specifically asked for a quote on the item.  The quote was reasonable, upon my return to pick up the coat I was charged double what I was quoted.    I was told there was no way they quoted me that price and they called me a liar.\n  \nIt was so rude, the other customers in the store started to argue for me (thank goodness for good people sticking up for each other).\n  \nWhen I continued to try and get the quoted price, the counter person made the gesture with her hands, like a duck quacking (the gesture you make when someone is talking too much).   Wow!  I called her out on that!   It was so rude.  \n\nWhen I asked to talk to the owner, the lady suddenly didn't understand english.  Then, after finally understanding the word \""owner\"" said she was the owner.  What a joke!\n  \nI filed a compliant with the Better Business Bureau. Celebrity Cleaners refused to respond to BBB letters.  I've used this service for my husbands business shirts and pressing services on and off for more than 10 years.  I'd be crazy to give them any more business."
"2","The first time that I visited Scottsdale, I stayed here only because they were hosting the convention I was attending.  They have two large swimming pools, the rooms are nice, and they have free WiFi, which lately seems to be rare in more expensive hotels.  Why can I get free WiFi at the Super 8 Motel in Ogallala, Nebraska, but not the Logan Airport Hilton in Boston?  But I digress...\n\nA good, hot breakfast is served each morning with options like made-to-order breakfast burritos and more traditional fare.  The staff is also helpful in recommending local restaurants and attractions."
"2","What an amazing hotel! The complimentary breakfasts rock, the rooms are spacious and just perfect! Our room had an awesome side view of camelback from the balcony and the quiet environment was the best. Though it was quite chilly to go swimming, I do regret not swimming in their heated pools during my stay. I would definitely stay here again!"
"2","Chaparral Suites have big rooms that work great for a family of four. We stayed in a double queen and the pull out couch in the living area was nice for the kids to have separated beds. The rooms are on the older side but the entire hotel has lots of character. There is plenty poolside space to lay about.\nWe also enjoyed the cooked breakfast in the morning and the complimentary drinks in the evening. Looking forward to returning soon."
"2","It's definitely a good place to stay if you are in Scottsdale. It about a 15-20 minute walk to Fashion Square. It's also close to Old Town. \n\nWe were able to get good savings from hotels.com. I have seen Living Social offers so discounts so there are other ways to get discounts. We were able to save quite a bit of money since the hotel offered a free shuttle to and from the airport. They also offered free hot breakfast that was made to order. There was happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm. \n\nOur room included a living room, kitchenette, two TVs, and an additional sink in the bedroom. The additional sink was great for my aunt and I especially when we needed to get ready at the same time. \n\nThere is also a Dollar Rent A Car on site. Renting a car is easy, and they do offer an AMEX discount. Concierge was very helpful as they booked our Sedona tour prior to our arrival. Some of the front desk staff were more friendlier and nicer than others. \n\nUnfortunately, the place especially the courtyard area did not look as pretty as the pictures. Although the rooms are nice and clean, I agree with other Yelpers that it does need a renovation. \n\nI recommend this hotel if you are not going to be on site the majority of the time and for the great amenities. Otherwise, if I had the money, then I would stay at resort."
"2","Sure the place is a giant gimmick, but its a fun gimmick and for what it is they do it well enough.  The food is what you would expect from a diner and it really isn't bad at all.  My boyfriend loves the shakes, I can't do much ice cream so I haven't had one.  On certain days of the week they have awesome deals for kid's meals.  One other thing that impressed me about 5 & Diner was found on their website.  First they have all of their nutritional information available, but even more impressive is they have a menu for Gluten free choices as well as Lactose free choices.  Very cool in my opinion."
"2","I'm sitting here right now enjoying my country fried chicken! Its really yummy. The gravy is also very tasty. This vanilla mr. Pibb is vanilla as vanilla can be. Im all around pleased. The service is good, food is good and the ambiance hits the diner feel spot on."
"2","My family and I have lived here for almost 3 years now, and we are staying put for a while. \n\nThe community is small, but we love that about Miramonte. Most neighbors are very friendly, and the grounds are always kept tidy. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing, offering a fire pit and cabanas. We love swimming as often as we can! The fitness room may be small, but it gives you enough to sweat and burn. \n\nThe neighbors, most anyway, are always friendly. Parking is never a problem, in the 3 years we've been there, only twice has our parking spot been taken. When it is, we ask nicely for it to be moved and it gets moved. \n\nMaintenance is incredible, super quick and very friendly. The front office staff is also very friendly and helpful. \n\nWe have a small dog and 4 year old, and we love it here. It's the perfect little place for us, and we recommend it to anyone. We do face Hayden road, but noise isn't too bad. In the mornings, you can sometimes here the band at Saguaro high school play, and i'm sure the neighbors facing Pueblo elementary hear the giggles, screams, and running of small kiddos, but other than that we have no complaints!"
"1","The food is OK but they take 20 minutes for stuff to be out.\n\nI was sitting inside at a table ...waited 20 minutes for food and had to be on a business call. so i just come out, talked 5 mts come back and see that the drink  i had half drunk  has been wiped off.\n\ni ask the Lady ( seems to be the owner) she almost shouts at me why I had left.\nI told that i was on a call so i had to walk outside..she angrily hands my food 30 minutes later. This is customer TORTURE.\n\nNEVER EVER going BACK.\n\nand the coffee here sucks...try some other store...even starbucks is better"
"2","One of my favorite breakfast & lunch spots since I moved to Arizona. I can't say enough good things about this place. The owners are wonderful and the food even better. Everything is made from scratch down to the salad dressings. I recommend trying one of their famous cookies, they are to die for!"
"2","Probably not a destination you would visit unless you worked here or wanted to have a business meeting and thats the kind of people you run into here.  Beautiful business people.  I met a friend just to check out the baked goods and try the coffee.\n\nIt's really a full dining experience with a breakfast and lunch menu that look delicious.  I got to spy some of the lunch items heading out for catering and they looked fab!\n\nCoffee and baked goods were good but I think I spent as much in parking fees as I did in coffee.\n\nStaff is probably the only questionable factor here.  Manager was correcting them loudly in eating area which seemed very unprofessional.  Good workers are hard to find.\n\nThanks Romancing you do a great job!"
"2","Amazing!  Hidden jewel of Tempe and wonderful people!"
"2","Great location, lots of gas pumps. \n\nEasy to get in-and-out of: right off the 101, about 30 seconds west of the freeway.\n\nI only go to Chevron and this is where I go besides the one on Scottsdale Rd and Bell."
"2","Needed a quick bite in Scottsdale so I used the Yelp app and swung by this place.  I was a little taken aback by the location but once we got inside, it was nothing but goodness.  We had the pizza hoagie with potato salad.  Amazing.  The potato salad was nice and tangy with no celery, just the way I like it.  The pizza hoagie came with a generous amount of cheese and delicious tomato sauce.\n\nStaff was super friendly and helpful.  Definitely a keeper.\n\nCash only!"
"1","I think a more appropriate name for this restaurant should be \""The Disappointing Egg\"", as I was very disappointed in my meal. I got a veggie omelet that was supposed to include broccoli among other vegetables. The \""broccoli\"" in my omelet was literally a pinch of broccoli scraps that you might find at the bottom of the bag. It was mostly onion, which is a pretty big cop-op for an overpriced omelet. Granted, this was my first time here, so bear that in mind w/me review, this experience has lead me to not want to come back. I found it to be a waste of time, money, and calories."
"1","Prices are way high for a breakfast place. Over 25 dollars for two adults. Cute atmosphere, but the food, which sounded unique and delicious on the menu, did not live up to the talk. Super disappointed."
"1","Bad from the start. Dirty silverware, really dirty table. The waitress seemed bothered that I asked her to wipe the table down. The food either over or under cooked. Overall a horrible first time experience...waited about 10 minutes to talk to manager but she couldn't tear herself away from chatting with some friends so I left."
"2","Florentine bennidict was amazing!"
"2","Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!"
"1","We used to come here when I was a kid-so recently on a visit to AZ we tried it out again. Not bad-it was weird that there was a special \""only if you pay extra\"" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route.\nIt was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice."
"1","Its a salad buffet....thats it! It's boring.  It's clean, good service, but its not exciting."
"2","So I'm sure like most guys this is not a place you would want to spend a Friday or Saturday night at a theater..... But it was date-night with the Girl and I saw there was Hairspray showing at this theater. Once again not how i want to spend a weekend night but I know my GF and she loooooves that musical. So being the good guy I am I got tickets. \n    I was expecting to go and sleep through the show and call it a night......however once the lights went down and the show started I was blown away! The cast was awesome there were no mess ups and everyone was on key. I really enjoyed myself, everyone was enthusiastic and professional the guy playing the mother was fantastic and it was all around a great time. I am for sure going to make this a date-night staple from now on..... Hope they bring the Producers soon."
"1","I really enjoyed shopping here until yesterday.  Everyone is always helpful all over the store and even at check out when they thank you by name.\n\nI was picking up some Ranger IPA on my way home and Serena was at the check out counter.  She was a bitch.\n\nI'd rather go to Fry's on Indian School or drive further to Whole Foods for specialty items.  I'm not going to this Safeway again."
"2","I LOVE Rays !!!\n\nWhen ever I'm in Phx this is my first stop. I always get the pizza and wing special. Large pizza and 20 wings.\n\nThey have the best wings in valley !!!"
"1","My boyfriend and I are visiting from San Diego and were looking for a good happy hour.  The two-for-ones brought us to this place.  The vibe seemed pretty good, the music was pretty good but the people watching was actually the best.  The bartender staff were pretty wild and seemed to be having a great time.  There was also a speed dating event going on - pretty \""40 year old virgin\"" ish.  \n\nThis is an interesting crowd as there were a number of guys with shaved heads - is that an Arizona thing or is it symbolic of something else?   The crowd demographics are either young or old and not much in between.  \n\nThe appetizer food that looked good on line sucked!  Although cheap, you got what you paid for.  We had crab cakes, chicken wings, calamari rings and french fries.  French fries were way over cooked and too brown; calamari was chewy; and the chicken wings were fried too long.  \n\nIf you want cheap entertainment, go there but don't expect good drinks or food - just good, old fashioned people watching!"
"1","I know I won't get any freebies on this review but who cares. Truth is more valuable.\nI dropped in last night. It was the cheeziest get together I've ever experienced.  Filled with people who don't know how to socialize, sad faces abounded, appeared to be a park and swap gig with cheap jewelry on tables for sale.!   The way 90% of these patrons were dressed, astonished me! OMG. Cheap cheap and quack quack!  I should of known hwen I noticed the cars in the parking lot, I've not  seen  so many old cars and trucks, since  I attending the Park and Swap experience. The drinks (wine) is so bad, you can expect to spend most your time 'later; in the bathroom with diareaha, either from the cheap beverages they serve or the nasty germs they have in this place....I would rather mow my lawn than frequent this establishment again...off to Montelucia, El Choro, & Ocean Club which are much better places to spend your money and time and eyes loking at the crowds.  Look for my lates reviews every Saturday mornings!"
"1","If I could give a nostar rating for my very first experience here I would. I decided to try them out since everyone gave them a great review and they are doing the 4 garments & 1 comforter for free deal. Well upon my arrival I mentioned  the \""Yelp\"" deal and they said that only applied to the Tempe location?!! I wonder f you go to Tempe, they tell you it only applies to the Scottsdale location. Not impressed on first contact. I walked out."
"2","Love Shane Co! My fianc\u00e9 surprised me with the most beautiful ring from here and the diamond is absolutely gorgeous! The ring was a little loose, so we took it in (which is kind of far from us) and they were able to resize it and polish it all in one visit :) Over all, we've been very pleased with our experience at Shane Co!"
"2","I was very happy with my sales person and my purchase. They were not high pressure  and the ring and diamond I purchased were a higher quality and better price than other places I had been. \n\nIt doesnt stop there either, the  warranty plan we recieved was FREE and does not require us to bring the ring in at scheduled intervals to keep the warranty valid (Other stores charged for warranty plans and required the item be brought in every 6 months for a cleaning and checkup to keep the warranty valid) . After about 2 years my wife noticed one of the smaller stones had fallen out so I took the ring back and they replaced the stone no questions asked. Also we can take it back at anytime for a cleaning. \n\nI would highly recommend anyone to at least visit Shane Co. when they are looking for any jewlery item."
"2","The staff is very friendly. The rooms while a little dated are clean. Every room has a mini refrig, microwave and coffee maker, a big plus in my eyes, I love every morning you can go and enjoy a lovely free breakfast inside or out on the deck or even back at your room. At Night they have fresh coffee and cookies if you are looking for a snack, \nThe hotel is well located to shopping and night life. This is the only place I will stay when I come to Scottsdale,"
"2","A decent little nail salon that I go to if the place I regularly attended is way too busy. The ladies (and the guy) are really nice and its never really busy  (at least when I go) and the only reason I don't go their more is because its just a little bit more expensive. Not by much, but I just have a great rapport at the other place as I have been going their longer.  If you are in the area, check out China Nails. They will definitely take good care of you."
"2","I went back for the Wednesday night wine class and had the pleasure of enjoying the company of Donald S. and the Beautiful Carin for my visit. \n\nThis event is informative and fun for singles, couples or small groups. $15 per person gets you generous pours, a bottle of water (to cleanse your palate) and a meat and cheese tray for the table. \n\nEveryone tastes each wine at the same time and each wine is introduced by the distributor/representative who explains the terroir, process distinctions or  trivia about the wine maker.  A great opportunity to learn what you like and don't like about wine, but not pretentious. We were able to enjoy short conversations in between explanations. \n\nReservations are strongly suggested but can be made the day before the event, depending on the size of your group."
"1","I do not recommend this school. I was extremely dissatisfied with the school's inflexible policies, the communication rendered by employees, and the effects enrollment there had on my child.\n\n1) Incompetent Care\nThe entire time my three year old attended, she had a rash on her rear, as they did not wipe her properly when she used the bathroom. Three year old's need assistance in getting cleaned up after they go potty - this is daycare 101. As soon as my child would come home, her rash would clear up - then return during the next week at school. I spoke to the employees at the school about this on several occasions and nothing was done to correct the problem.\n\n2) Forced Naps\nTwo hours out of the five my daughter attended Scottsdale Academy daily, the children were required to nap. No provision was made for children who don't nap (mine just happens to be one of those kids who don't). They are not even allowed to quietly read or draw - they are forced to lie there. Failing to provide an option for a quiet activity / assuming all children fit one mold is simply bad childcare.\n\n3) Inflexible Policies\nThis school requires that you pick up your child at a certain time, regardless of what time you drop them off. For every five minutes you are late, they charge you $5.00. They are completely inflexible about this regulation, even for moms who have other kids to pick up across town after school. Because of this rule, I was forced to pick up my little girl at 2 PM before the other after-school pick-ups I needed to make, thus reducing the amount of time she was spending at Scottsdale Academy. They would do nothing to modify their fees to compensate for this, and were completely unwilling to make adjustments based on actual hourly attendance. It's as if they do not want your business!  Interesting business model - I imagine attrition is high at this school. I know I was only too happy to withdraw my child. (By the way, they don't refund any of your money when you withdraw.)\n\n4) Communication Problems\nThe daycare workers at Scottsdale Academy do not communicate with parents about the daily experiences/progress of their children. A slip of paper is provided at the end of the day telling parents that the child napped or did not, ate or did not, and what project was completed. No other information is shared - nothing about social interactions, milestones, problems, or other pertinent issues. When I arrived to pick up my child, everyone there acted as if they were too busy to stop and talk to me."
"2","As a person who regularly stays at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I consider 5 stars a big deal.  I stayed here, with my mom, for one night before staying 2 nights at said Ritz-Carlton, and I was upset that I didn't stay here the entire time.  The rooms at this resort far exceeded my expectations.  It's usually a timeshare type of place, so the full kitchen and separation of the bedroom was expected, but the enormous and luxurious bathroom was not.  I mean, the tub can easily fit two people AND has jets, and the shower is big enough to have a decent-sized party in!  Also, the sofa has a pull out, so the rooms are very accomadating.  This is by far the best place I've ever stayed in the Phoenix-Metro area.  I have a 3-night stay booked for the first weekend in September, and I can't wait!"
"2","Efficiency condo but roomy, with louvered doors to shut off bedroom, and bed very comfortable.  No full kitchen as advertised and no ice-maker.  Free Wi-Fi!  Set-up a little strange but nice:  you park your car and a bellman takes you to your room in a golf cart!  Nice to have someone load and unload but of course that involved a tip!  Sometimes parking involves a long walk back to your car.  Nice young men James and Josh very friendly and helpful as bell men.  Nice outdoor porch, but almost got a haircut from a stray golf ball!  Pool and hot tub roomy and nice.  Roomy jacuzzi tub with large window.  Windows have blinds between glass that are difficult to black out.  Shower nice but at times hot water took a while to come up.  Would stay here again!"
"2","Fun place for groups! Benihana wouldn't be my first choice for sushi or for going out at all really, but if you have a special occasion for some friends it would be a good place to consider. Pricey food, but I thought it was good. Haven't tried the sushi yet. \n\nBenihana is known for it's tables which are centered around a stove. You get your own chef who comes over and prepares your whole meal for you! They do lots of crazy tricks and entertain the table while cooking. Lots of fire tricks too! \n\nIt's the kind of place you can say you have been to and it;s a fun experience, but you don't need to go back after that."
"1","As you can probably tell by my other reviews-- I'm one of those, \""if you don't have something nice to say....yadda yadda yadda.\""  But in the spirit of Yelp and actual critical review--- I'll have to suggest steering clear of Benihana; at least until they add more spices and seasonings to their repertoire.\n\nYes, yes, yes, I should've known.  I'm not much of a 'chain' eater-- but this was my boyfriend's family's pick for his graduation dinner.  It seems to be a family favorite.... which I can't say I really understand.  At all.  I also should mention that this review is based entirely on their only vegetarian dinner option.  \n\nI didn't get a look at the bill, but my course was at least over $25 for far less than exemplar fare. Granted, this included a miso soup, small lettuce & carrot salad, tofu appe, egg fried rice, grilled assorted vegetables as the entree, and a scoop of rainbow sorbet for dessert-- but it reaffirms how one should rely on the old standby of quality versus quantity.  And I guess they have to charge that much to keep the Benihana salt mines open....  heaven sakes! The waitress was giggling to herself about how much water I was putting down, but I really can't imagine that this is a rare thing with their preferred method of seasoning; salting the bejesus out of everything from the pasty, ginger-esque dressing on the salad and the soggy, cold, fried tofu appe to the soy-and-butter sopping vegetables.  The only reprieve was the rainbow sorbet and a nice hot green tea closer.  \n\nEveryone else at the table had either a meat or seafood course, and were quite satisfied with their meals, so MAYBE it was just the veggie option or MAYBE I'm just a picky foodie or just MAYBE this place really needs the constructive criticism.  And yes, I also realize this place is possibly more about the show than the food...???.... but our chef, though nice, was quite lackluster and didn't have a full cashe of tricks to unveil.  Just the onion volcano.  Sigh."
"1","Well, my kids like Benny-Ha-ha..... \n\nWe've eaten here several times - most recently on 2011-04-29.\n\nWe've dined at the teppanaki tables in the past, but most of the time (including our most recent visit) we just go to the sushi bar.  \n\nThe happy hour menu in the sushi bar brings prices down to a reasonable level; we can order several items, have a fair meal and not feel like we'll need another mortgage.  Usually, I order the hand rolls and an assortment of appetizers or sashimi.  Quality seems to be hit-and-miss depending on who made your order - the chef or the sous-chef.  The place is obviously cutting cost; in recent visits (as in more than one), they've stopped providing complimentary edamame and the portions seem to have gotten smaller.\nIn the past, we have tried the teppanaki tables - usually when we have a group in town.  It's a bit of a chef show (same routines almost 95% of the time), but that's what it is - a show.  The resulting food tends to be somewhat bland.  You're paying for the experience and average food; I'd rather pay for good food and live with the experience.  \nFor now we'll stick with the happy hour sushi bar menu."
"2","The chicken shwarma is awesome!   The fries are hand cut and really good. Service is quick and the prices are reasonable. May have found my new lunch spot!"
"1","Went here for lunch. Got the gyro special. The tomatoes were soggy and the pita bread was a little dry. The fries were clumped together and tasted like they had been cooked in old oil. Don't think I'll be going back."
"2","The selection is so overwhelming in a good way. I had eggs benedict. The eggs were perfectly cooked so many placed kill the eggs. I was a happy camper. Plus going on a Tuesday you get double stamps on their free meal card."
"2","Kick ass breakfast place.  Friendly efficeint staff serve up tasty fresh food!"
"2","This place has been here forever. Though, it has undergone a serious facelift over the past three or four months. The food is equally good, if not slgihtly better, and there is even talk of making it a bar at night. Booze and fried wontons? Yes, please!\n\nThe layout actually might lend itself successfully to a bar. You have the little takeout counter that opens up into an outdoor section that leads into another room. It hasn't happened yet, but it could be like a little Devil's Martini waiting to happen. Keep your eyes out for it!"
"1","I have always wanted to go here. It looks so fun from the outside. FINALLY the time has come. The staff was extremely friendly, food was above decent and decent portions. Only two complaints in that area....No splenda, only Sweet n Low  and I asked for spicy and it wasnt even close.\n\n\nI would have given it 3 stars but I can't because of the following: The bathroom: It was funky but filthy. It's 1120am and the trash cans are overflowing, there are empty toilet paper rolls scattered about and it smells. It was like a dressed up gas station bathroom. The garbage can next to our table was full and was dirty. There are tons of  things hanging from the ceiling that will catch your eye. the one that caught my eye was the giant chinese food container near the entrance and not far above from where we were sitting.. while cute and fun it was also filthy. This place needs a power wash.."
"1","A dive bar that features Chinese food? Now those aren't two things you hear in the same sentence!  After trying this place I know why! \n\nMy buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.  \n\nWe both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice.\nI barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer. \n\nHad high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food."
"1","A year ago I'd have given them at least four stars.  The ambiance was great, cool decor, food was tasty and reasonable, service was friendly, and the beer selection was really good.  However, I've kinda given up on this place.  For the past YEAR, they've been saying that their kitchen would be open \""soon.\""  For a good month, probably 6 weeks now, they've had a sign up outside that says their kitchen will be open \""Really Soon.\""  Well... a year ain't \""soon\"" folks.  Many times I drove up from old town Scottsdale to go enjoy a few beverages and a good meal there.  But as I said, I've given up on this place.  Not quite sure how they're staying afloat anymore."
"1","I received lip injections from Dr. Caniglia. I was skeptical because when I called the receptionist informed me he did not have before and after pictures of his patients for this particular procedure. I went against my better judgement since Dr. Caniglia specializes in facial plastic surgery.\n\nDr. Caniglia rushed through the procedure and did not shape my lips. I was left with asymmetry from too much filler in one side of my lip. This is a direct result of the skill and experience of the injector. \n\nI was told I would need to pay for another syringe for him to \""correct\"" the results. Dr. Caniglia's techniques seem dated and I will need to have another surgeon correct the bad injections.\n\nLesson learned I will not go to a plastic surgeon who does not have before and after pictures available for the specific procedure I want."
"1","Some how my review got deleted!!  Probably some of the most awful/over priced sushi I've ever eaten!! I am a crazy sushi lover!! I just moved to Arizona from LA, ca and I've been checking out different sushi joints....trying to find the best one in AZ. This place was crazy over priced for the crap food they gave us! My husband got salmon and I got a few rolls. The food quality was AWFUL! The service sucked! I don't mind paying $100 for a few sushi rolls, soup, and some salmon, but it better be good! Sadly it was not, the rolls were small and very thin...the rice was hard! This was the first time in my whole 22 years of eating sushi that I've ever experienced hard rice on a sushi roll!! On a better note, the salmon and soup was pretty good! I will NEVER return to this place......"
"2","I have been bringing my son here for over 6 years.They have video games and toys for the kids. My son goes to both the dentist and orthodontist. I truly can't say anything negative. The staff is wonderful. The office is well run, and I am confident he is getting great care."
"1","Watery pasta and burnt garlic bread... Havent tried the pizza yet \nI couldve just as easily made a pasta and garlic bread way more worth while!  Not going to be lazy about it again smh"
"1","Service here sucks.\nI love the food still.\n\nBut the service is so bad, I never want to come back.\nHonestly.\n\nSorry Zinc, ya'll need to get new servers or some shit.  AWFUL service. AWFUL management."
"1","Ok I will be short but what I have to say is not so sweet. I am astounded that this place is still in business.  We went this last Saturday night and were treated horribly. After an hour of waiting for our food and not having been acknowledged by our waitress. My husband & I got up to leave. (The people next to us had fininshed thier meal and they had been seated 20 minutes after us.) We asked to speak to the Mgr. He did not come, only sent the bill for our food ( that we never had recieved) and said that he would have it wrapped up for us to go. When we stated that we wereonly going to pay for what we had been served the Mgr (then suddenly appeared &)   said that he was going to call the sherrif. I think everyone has expereinced bad service but this place literally takes the cake."
"2","I've had lunch at zinc bistro at least 20 times, during the three out of the last six years I wasn't overseas, and only ever ordered the duck confit sandwich, because it is so exceptionally outstanding. \n\nHowever, I try to get dinner there at least once a month, and have never been disappointed in the slightest. \n\nRecently I've had rabbit there, and a lobster special that came with ravioli that were the shape and color to my sinicized eye, due to the superior quality of their wrappers and sauce they were served in, of dried stewed abalone. They weren't any less precious or savory. \n\nIt's a restaurant where it's hard to recommend one dish over another because of the uniform excellence, so have whatever appeals to you, and don't be afraid to try something new, because it will surprise you with just how good it is.  You will become convinced that it is one of the very best restaurants in the state. \n\nThey've got a tarte tatin, which is a sort of french apple cake-tart, served with cream that has just the slightest, most surprising and delicious hint of brie in it. So if I have to recommend something beside eating duck sandwiches there every chance you get, then I recommend that."
"1","My wife and I had a 8 o'clock reservation at Zinc.  We were ushered to a two top in the traffic pattern, easily the worst table in the room.  there were several banquets available and we were told noway, no how we are fully booked.  One hour and ten minutes later all these tables were still empty. Our waitperson was efficient and officious.  we felt like we were more in a diner than a \""fine dining restaurant\"".  I had the chicken dish - $28.00 for about 6 ounces of chicken, 2 ounces of risotto and about 20 green peas?  Draft beers are served about 2/3rd of a glass at $7.00?  There isn't anything about Zinc that is French except for the Frisee salad and the attitude.  $140.00 plus. Way over rated.  One plus,\nThe ambiance is great."
"2","Wow. Just happened by this place with my friends. We were seated quickly right in the middle by a cool lit up eifel tower. Loved the ambiance and the food was AMAZING!!! A little pricey with small portions but so elegantly prepared. We waited a little longer than usual between appetizers, main course, and dessert, but it was worth it, and it was also a busy Saturday night. Everyone was friendly, the food was to die for, and the decor and atmosphere was so very nice."
"2","We were feeling courageous on a Friday night at 6pm to try and have dinner here, as it had been a while.  \n\nWe were lucky to get in right away, as there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes.  \n\nWe were seated and promptly served warm bread and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it and she was pleasant, even though the restaurant was PACKED. \n\nThe app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced.\n\nThe bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments.\n\nI enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).  \n\nOverall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not).\n\nFor a chain restaurant, this restaurant, especially this location is worth it."
"2","I love the food at cheesecake factory. I can't go there often though because they don't have organic non chemicalized products. If they had non GMO chicken and organic salads i would be back. But because like most restaurants they use the GMO foods now, i have to prepare my own foods at home. Look up GMO. Cheesecake factory should offer a non GMO menu for people who would pay a little less for food that is healthy."
"2","This place is amazing... had all of my pants hemmed here and they always did a fantastic job at VERY cheap prices. They knew me by name after a few visits, and even let me in a few times after closing. If I needed something back fast they were always accommodating. I even had a bridesmaid dress altered here and they did it for under $50 - can't complain at all!!!!"
"2","I found Judy's about 6 months ago....I was searching for a good Alteration business to bring my clothes too..I have been to others but never really satisfied with the quality of work....Judy's work is outstanding and I have used them several times in the last 6 months...The normal wait appears to be a week but very well worth the wait.....Great service !!!!! You can try on your clothes and she can take the measurements ,  make the markings & pin up the clothing  in no time....Very Happy with the Work and Service...Thanks Michael"
"1","This mouthy Dago needs a lesson in customer service. Plus he treats his help like crap. ( A true test of an asshle owner) You idiots that pass off this poor behavior as New York -ese  should go back there."
"1","This place is for people whose palate has yet to evolve beyond Spaghetti-Ohs.\nDeli products are overpriced.\nAnd the sandwiches are as disappointing as my effort in the bedroom. \nNot really.\n\nYeah...really.\n[sigh]"
"1","Today was my last visit. The customer service is consistently poor and in a day and age where the average consumer has a multitude of meal options in front of them, what really sets places apart is how they interact with patrons. When a manager/owner is rude, abrupt and downright disrespectful to customers, what is to be assumed except that they don't value their business. \n\nI do wish them luck as a mom & pop shop. I think we need more family run eateries in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area...but Rinaldi's? It'll be an uphill battle if they choose to continue to treat their clientele in this fashion. It's too bad."
"2","Great go-to place for lunch.  The menu items are done well - mostly sandwiches and salads.  Owner is very friendly and takes an active role in the business. It seems like he runs the place well."
"1","Stopped in here for a quick bite around 2PM on a weekday. Had the chicken wrap, which when it arrived had obviously been microwaved and possessed no discernible pieces of chicken. A lot of sauce and warm gooey fried muck made up the rest of the interior of the wrap, although the lettuce and tomatoes seemed okay for the couple of bites I took. The coleslaw (side) seemed fresh and was enjoyable since that was all I got to enjoy this day. Save your $8...unless you like a cup of overpriced coleslaw. LOL \n\nI will give this place another chance, but they also seem to have a bunch of pretentious, a-hole, 50-something \""dudes\"" as regulars in the afternoon...which seemed odd (and uncomfortable) being the 30-something, pretentious guy that I am."
"2","Neat discovery!  Adorable and unique clothes and lots of Michael Stars tops.  They also have a lot of very reasonably priced cute jewelry.  The name is pretty misleading because the clothing they sell is really not exercise wear it is more for being out and about.  The woman who works here was very nice too."
"2","Hope they keep this store if BN has any plans of closing more stores.  We used to come here to study; then it was to peruse after we started our professional careers.  Now, we come here as a family to pick out books for our toddler.  Good times!"
"1","I only go to Ulta when I have to, and always leave mad.  Yes, they're the only place close by that has the better cosmetic brands.  And you don't have the hassle of a big mall.  And the floor staff does sincerely want to help you.  \n\nHowever, the merchandise is laid out so haphazardly I hardly ever can find what I came in for.  And neither can the salesperson who inevitably gets enlisted to help me.  So the salesperson tries to steer me toward an alternate product that's nothing like what I asked for because she really isn't all that knowledgeable about the products.  The one time I took their salesperson's advice I sorely regretted it, so I usually just end up shooing them off after a while.  \n\nThen there's checkout.  Awwwww jeez.  Wait in line forever listening to the inane chatter going on ahead of me.  Then the, \""do you have your Ulta card, I can look it up for you, would you like one, where should we send your free magazines\"".  Hey lady, I just want to buy some make up, not join a country club.  Just ring me up and get me out of this madhouse."
"1","What a disappointment! \n\nWent tonight with wife and our 11-month old daughter, looking forward to giving a locally-owned store some business and picking a special present for our little gal. \n\nGreat selection of toys, cute store, lots of interesting things right inside the door. However, after 20 minutes, no-one had acknowledged us, said hello, offered assistance ... nothing. This despite the owners and two young employees were walking around and only 1-2 other customers were in the store. -2 stars.\n\nAsked the gal behind the counter if we could open an item for our daughter to try it out. This would have required removing 2-3 pieces of tape, but no - not possible. -1 star.\n\nBut the straw that really broke the old camel's back came when we were offered to sign up for their mailing list. Members of the list get a little birthday gift every year. Great, we thought - our daughter's birthday is two days away. Alas, \""she'll have to wait till next year\"" because store policy dictated a few more days notice! Say what? Yep, \""wait till next year\"" we were told again. -more stars than I can deduct!!!\n\nSo we took our $50 purchase and left disappointed with no plans to return. Even Buy Buy Baby has 10x better customer service, greets you, offers assistance (sometimes even too much), but a mom & pop store can't even say hello and welcome, or see the awkwardness in denying a birthday gift to a first customer who could have become a regular for the next 10 years? \n\nHello and goodbye, Kidstop. Never again."
"2","I love getting the Mango Chicken Salad! Its fast and fresh! I like that."
"2","Nice happy hour! I love the fried chicken wings with minced garlic and jalapeno peppers. Green Chicken Curry is also very yummy!"
"2","Fastest lunch ever.  Great vegan options.  Friendly service.  I wish my wife liked Chines because it would definitely be a dinner option.  For now, it's my quickie lunches at the bar.  Fried rice and crispy tofu!"
"1","This place is a dump!  Went for spring break April 2013 and would not let my 5 and 7 year old in the dirty pool - water slide is lame and the wave rider is a total rip off - checked-out 2 hours after we checked-in"
"1","Nice grounds. Ok room. Internet went down.  Maid never came to room at a normal hour. We would be back from the pool or golf or other day activity around 6 pm and getting ready for the evening, and would get a knock on the door and them attempting to clean the room. I have never stayed at a resort where the maids come past 3-4, let alone that late. Our room got cleaned once in 4 days. Terrible customer service. So hard to get ahold of anyone while staying here. Left countless messages that went unreturned. Set up cabana at pool and let concierge know I would have guests weeks in advance via email. Day of they told me I had a limit. Almost Ruined birthday party. Pretty much Ruined our stay as it pissed me off beyond comprehension. I was forced to talk to multiple different managers delaying start of festivities. Finally I had to pay for another room that I didn't need to get everyone in. All could have been solved with  clear communication from beginning on their part. Food sucks on top of that. Too many good options in this area to deal with the garbage customer service and nickel and diming guests who plan to spend thousands here over one weekend. My experience at this hotel has soured me on the entire westin and Starwood brand. People come to resorts to relax and have fun. My stay here has been anything but due to them putting me through the ringer and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me. Avoid at all costs."
"2","Thanks to some friends coming into town I got to check out The Westin Kierland Resort, what a great looking place! Very grand.\n\nRoom 2163 was the spot, and I have to say I was sort of shocked because it was on the small side; the bathroom had a shower stall  for one, not even a bathtub. \n\nThere was a nice size king bed that was comfy. My friends brought their dogs with them and the resort does provide kennels, food bowls and even a heavenly doggy pillow for them to sleep on, I thought that was pretty sweet.  The doors opened up to a outside seating area next to the lush green grass.  The room also had a desk, comfy love seat, mini bar, a mini sink & counter top, just over all was a very small room. \n\nCheck out 2 of the pool areas, one where the lazy river is at, posted everywhere it says the lazy river is opened till 7, but we went for it around 6:30 and we were told it was already closed.  This pool area closed at 8pm but we just walked across and went to the pool that's opened 24 hours and hung out there. \n\nOver all enjoyed my time at the Westin Kierland, looking forward to booking a staycation soon!"
"2","Swanky hotel where everything you can imagine is part of the resort!  \n\nThey mean it when they say resort here.  There is a golf course, tennis court, swimming pool, hot tub, fitness center, shuttle to the small shopping center, gift shop,  bar and during the summer this have this complex water park open during the day only. This resort made my stay wonderful.  Nice views of the golf course which I find odd, but sure. Everyone was attentive towards requests.  I wanted to see how long the walk would be to Scottsdale quarter and they offered to call up the shuttle driver to take me there.  It was a nice drive through the lanes,  as it would have taken me ten minutes to walk there.  I did walk be to the hotel in ten minutes, so the attractions aren't far from the resort.   One setback is depending on where your room is relative to the lobby you might be giving yourself a self guided tour of the resort.  It spans a huge area.  \n\nI was there during December so I got to see the 3D holiday paint scaping lightshow during dinner. Very clever and unexpecting for a place like this.  For those who were staying in the rooms where the lights were going to shine through, they got a friendly door knock to close their blinds for the show :) It created a nice christmas touch to the season."
"1","Yay... for a change what I think about a particular establishment seems to be in the majority... so to keep my review \""brief\"", I will basically say that what all the other reviewers have written is exactly right... for what is essentially a \""outlet\"" store, the prices are crazy high. Selection usually tends to be less than stellar. \n\nOne thing that does keep me coming back to Nordstrom Rack is the shoes! They have a great selection of quality shoes, at reasonable prices. \n\nI much rather take my chances at Ross or Marshall's (both right down the street)."
"1","And the award for the worst customer service goes to  . . . Foot Solutions in Scottsdale!\n\nI have been to this store numerous times and every time it is the same scene.  I am completely ignored by the staff as they are far too busy having personal conversations to even acknowledge my presence.  Did I mention this was is a shoe store?  Not exactly the kind of place you can just help yourself.\n\nAfter today, I have decided to take my money somewhere else!  If you are in need of a solution for your foot, I suggest you do the same."
"1","I have been a devoted Monte Carlo customer for 4 years. Recently they lost one of my very expensive dress shirts. It took forever to replace and they kept giving me the runaround on when to pick up the check. Several times I requested the owner to touch base with me. He never did or the message wasn't delivered. He is either to busy or does not care. Very disappointed with how the situation was handled. I understand things can get lost at the cleaners but it's how quickly and attentive you respond that keeps a customer coming back, which I will not be."
"1","Nice furniture and a knowledgable friendly sales person but very dishonest delivery information.  When we said yes to the salesman on 5/28 he said they would deliver on 6/8. Seemed like a long time but OK. Then we went to pay and they say they can't deliver until 6/12. 4 days later their customer disservice staff calls to say they won't deliver until 6/18. \n\nWhen I call to complain to the salesman he tells me their prices are sooo low they just can't keep up. We went to Mor and got delivery the next day."
"2","I took my car here after finding a big screw in one of my tires. They didn't charge anything to pull it out and patch the hole. I insisted on paying something but received a \""I couldn't charge you with anything even if I wanted to.\""  Very friendly staff.  I was out the door in 20 minutes."
"2","Amazing service!!  Here's why:\n\nI had an appointment scheduled for an oil change at Advanced Auto out on Shea & Sahuaro today.  I requested the cheaper oil and had a $15.99 coupon.  They told me my 2012 Chrysler 200 had an engine made by Mercedes, which their computer was showing I needed the more expensive oil change which was nearly $100.  I explained that I had never gone for the more expensive oil and have had no problems.  He said they had to use only oil their computer tells them to use.  \n\nI chucked them the deuces  and peaced out.  Drove up the road to Jiffy Lube on Shea and was greeted with awesome service.  I even pulled a coupon from their website which expired 12/31/13 yet they said they will take any coupon expired or not, for anyone.  It took about 15 minutes and there is a little waiting area with coffee and water.  The shop is pretty small but extremely well run from what I saw today!"
"2","I love this little spot in Scottsdale. For the past few years, we've been catching 'It's A Wonderful Life' on Christmas Eve. Service was the same as always - great. Waiters were always on top of things. After the movie, we enjoyed drinks by the lounge. It was nice to enjoy this with a group of new friends and each left amazed at this experience. We'll definitely have to return more often. Cheers!"
"1","So sad to report that Farrelli's has CLOSED.  I received an email indicating it was due to a problem with the property owners.  You can read more on their website, http://www.farrellis.com/.  This is a big loss for the community.  Thanks for the memories, Farrelli's."
"2","As soon as I walked into Arrivederci in Scottsdale, I felt welcomed.\n\nThe cute, bustling Italian restaurant was cozy but elegant, with lots of chatter and linen-covered tables, and the staff at the door and servers were super-friendly. The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\n\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\n\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\n\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\n\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had. Not to mention, I'm still dreaming of that dessert."
"1","terrible"
"2","This store is so fun and funky. Has a ton of great jeans."
"1","this follow up comment from Jeff Hamra is absolutely not true.  I have had no feedback from Rolex after I offered proof and said I had receipts, emails, etc.  They never told me that this dealer had not sold me two used Rolex's.  I never heard from Rolex and in talking with another Rolex dealer and showing them the serial numbers they confirmed that these were an 11 year old and a 8 year old watch.  I never received updated warranty cards.  I am shocked that a dealer can get away with selling used watches as new - including paying current pricing."
"1","I was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night. It was a $5 cover to hear the house band, which was no biggy and then I asked for a diet coke which was another $3. Again, no problem paying for the diet coke. After about 30 minutes and some dancing, I went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free. The bartender told me it would be another $3. I mentioned that I was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that I thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible. Well that got me nowhere so I asked for a glass of water instead. I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.\n\nNow it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really? I don't mind paying the cover and the cost of the first diet coke, Im not being cheap but the point is that most bars appreciate and take care of the designated driver. I was being responsible and they couldn't even give me a glass of water!\n\nReally?"
"1","Total RIP OFF. I went into the store for a price quote on a new motor and some replacement cartridges and they gave me a reasonable price but when I called them to come out to do the work they charged me an extra  15% on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would cost. The repair man also did not bring the replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra 45 minutes while he drove back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten. I was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quote which it did not. When I called to ask the manager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile. I couldn't believe that they treat their customers this poorly. The repairman had done about  25 minutes  of work and they charged me 210.00 dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about 15% for all the parts quoted. For about 50 more bucks I could have replaced the entire system. I would advise anyone looking to have their pool serviced to go else where and avoid this dishonest company."
"1","What a waste of time. I waited a hour and half and was told they were too busy for walk ins today I should call and make an appointment. Will never be back. All they had to do is tell me before I waited how rude can someone be. Derek"
"1","I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.\nToday saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth..........\nI've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again."
"1","I am actually shocked to find a good review of this store.\n\nI have never felt more uncomfortable going anywhere. \nStopped in while my boyfriend was getting his oil changed as I heard great things about the store and actually have sent people to it! \n\nI walked in and they asked me to set my drink down on the counter- I have absolutely no problem with that as I know it is not actually their merchandise and they need to protect their consignors pieces from not getting stained. But as I walked around I could see them watching me and my boyfriend said he was uncomfortable and would wait outside. He came back in to grab me since his oil change was done and the sales associate asked me, \""What are you looking for? Or are you just looking.\"" in a tone that suggested I wasn't welcome. I then told her I had heard good things about her store and had always wanted to stop in. No response.\n\nThe store has a musty smell, the clothing while some were nice- most were outdated.\n\nThe reason for the 2 stars: her jewelry. She does a great job at displaying jewelry. \n\nCustomer service? None. Had she been more welcoming I would have ignore the musty smell and dated pieces."
"2","This restaurant gets 5 stars!!!  \n\nWe went here for Father's Day, and I wasn't sure what to think at first.  I looked over the menu before we went so I could decide what to get.  \n\nAfter getting to Tutti Santi (cute, quaint, family owned place) I was excited to sit down and eat.  They had some specials, so we got some ravioli appetizer and bread, and it was amazing, everyone had seconds! \n\nOur salads came out promptly with delicious dressing and fresh lettuce and vegetables.  \n\nWe waited a bit for our entrees, but we werent even really worried about it, and then the manager came out to apologize for the delay, and about 10 minutes later our food arrived.  I got Chicken fiorentina, which was lightly breaded chicken with a white cream sauce and sauteed spinach.  OMG, it was the best thing I have tasted!!!!\n\nWhen we were all finished, the manager came out with a complimentary slice of cheesecake for the delay and offered my dad a shot of sambuca.  \n\nGreat service, fun atmosphere and I will definitely be back to enjoy another one of their delicious meals."
"2","I've been to the Morton's in the Biltmore area several times and just loved it. Perfect every time. So when the boyfriend's mom wanted a steak dinner for Mother's Day of course our first choice was Morton's. Although we shouldn't have strayed from the Biltmore location.\n\nI'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.\n\nThe reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if \""everything was okay.\"" I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.\n\nThis location also feels much more casual than Biltmore's. I guess I'm old fashioned but when I go out for a steak dinner I get dressed up. Many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.\n\nNext time we're craving a Morton's steak, we'll be heading back to the Biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service, every time."
"1","Overpriced for an over salted steak with veggies that taste like those from Hometown Buffet.  This is the old west.  We got robbed by Morton's!"
"1","For $100 a head, I'd rather go to Taco Bell. \nI got the wrong order served to me, the wrong drinks, and the wrong bill. All by 3 separate waiters ' here to serve me'. \nThe staff did not know what they were doing. \n\nThey also told me they had no tables till 10pm, yet the restaraunt was just about empty when we got there. \n\nMorton would be highly disappointed."
"2","great stake as any other high end stake house, anything special ... I dint think so"
"1","Ra. Is Blah\nAnd the peeps. Give me the creeps.\n Service? Makes me nervous. \nThe vibe. Just don't jibe.\n Just not my scene. I'm a picky queen. \nDon't like the snotties. Acting all haughty.\nSake bombers cheap and good. Only reason I would.\nGo to Ra.\nBlah Blah Blah."
"1","So over rated. \nI'm from San Francisco- I have high standards for my sushi. \nI especially dislike sub-par fish in a place that tries to look/act swanky. \nThis reminds me of a sleazy date spot- oh wait it is!\n\nI prefer my secret spot in Avondale for better prices, fresher fish, and more attentive staff."
"1","Food was great! Service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. So disappointed. \n\nI went here with my friends last night for HH. I've been to RA before but tonight I had my $20 gift certificate for my half bday. I love this! I used this last year and couldn't wait to do it again. The Vegas roll is amazing! Now to the service. I initally sat inside but when my friends arrived we went out to the patio. The male server who brought me my drink inside was great! When we went outside and had a new server everything went down hill. First the server only brought us 1 menu for a table of 3 people. We had to ask for the HH menu and she dropped it down and walked away. When we ordered I asked if she could leave the HH menu there in case we wanted to order more drinks and she got an attitude with me (wasn't the first time) and told me she needed to make room on the table so she took it from me. I've noticed that the last couple of times I go to RA they leave the wasbi off of the sushi plates and I have to request for it when i receive my rolls. I had to do this last night and she again responded with an attitude and walked away. She never asked if we wanted refills. She was upset when I was trying to explain who was going to pay what with our cards. She came back with our cards she handed my check to me and mispronounced my name purposely (it's Jaime) so...  gave her my gift certificate and it seemed like the total owed was off she ignored us when we tried to call her over. She looked straight at us and kept walking. I just paid and left. I have no clue why she was in such a bad attitude but it's ashamed because I love the food and she made our experience horrible. Never going back there again and I'm going to vocalize our experience to my friends (at least not at that location)."
"2","I love the food here!  The sushi is always so fresh and delicious, and everything has such great flavor. The staff is always friendly, although possibly not trained the best on the official terms of ingredients in their dishes.  You can always find a table with a minimum wait. Their happy hour is fantastic. I love it!  This is a staple in our rotation of restaurants."
"1","The atmosphere was amazing. The sushi was fresh but lacked pizzaz and taste. My order was incorrect and the waitress was busy so i ended up just shutting my mouth. The bathroom was disgusting. The price was decent .. happy hour prices. I wont be back. Major dissapointment."
"2","This is a great sports bar in north scottsdale.  No 'snottsdale' folks here.\nSaturdays they have specials on their burgers, which are delicious.  They also have Taco Tuesdays, with discounted tacos.  Their menu has the usual mexican favorites and some good appetizers.  A good sports bar for the whole family to enjoy."
"1","Tried their guitar lessons for my child. Will never go there again. The teacher was so foul tempered, he broke the strings off my child's instrument on her second lesson; no apologies; blamed her for having the wrong kind of instrument; ranted the rest of what was left of the half hour lesson  and told her she needs to buy the second more expensive book. This may not reflect on all their teachers, but for me - this it it with music masters.\n\nWhat was worse is, when I reported this to the management - they were not apologetic at all until I told him I may report this.  He was justifying the behavior and said some parents like teachers to be that way. What parents are those???? :) No kiddin. \n\nAnyway, to their credit, he fixed the damaged instrument free of cost. He also gladly accepted the first book that I was asked to purchase on day one - for charity. Did not offer to refund, so I did not ask. Don't want anything to do with them anymore.\n\nI am sure there are better, healthier places out there for innocent music loving kids."
"2","I went to the clock doctor for help with my heirloom banjo clock this afternoon. They were very knowledgeable and helpful, not to mention charming.  My clock was fixed in about 5 minutes and I was given information and interesting history about my  treasured time piece. I would give a sincere  and high recommendation for this establishment.... THank you clock doctor."
"2","Agree with the previous great reviews.  Based on those reviews, I went by there and got a battery for my watch.  Quick and easy and they are so incredibly nice and personable.  You can join an email list for monthly emails of coupons or specials and to make this place even sweeter....it is right next to a walk up/drive through Starbucks.  A win win if you ask me!"
"2","I recently moved down the street from Havana and I had heard great things. \nI've dined here a few times now and the food is amazing!\nMy favorites are the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters,avocado dip) and Camarones Havana. So good!!\nThe mojitos are really good too. \nThe only problem with Havana is the speed of service. The servers are always friendly, but things take FOREVER to get to the table. Even my Mojito took 20 min last time.\nI will continue to come here for the killer food, but don't come if you are on any type of schedule, starving or really thirsty...it will take awhile."
"1","A WORD OF CAUTION:  \nWhen I left the restaurant, I paid for my dinner with a credit card.  Two weeks later when I received my monthly credit card statement, I realized Havana Cafe did a DOUBLE CHARGE on the credit card!  I called, and initially accounting stated that it was not a double charge, \""that it just looked that way\"".  I called Visa, and the second charge was immediately removed. \nI spoke with the owner - she apologized and offered me a mere 15% discount on my next meal, which I thought was rather tacky.\nWord to the wise: examine your credit card statements, as Havana caf\u00e9 was not about to call me!"
"1","Cheesy, outdated decor, sky high prices with service that does not match, so so food. Went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta. Sorry we did. Our server was very proud of the fact that he knew we were gluten free and knew how to take care of us. I reminded him again when salads were ordered. Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta. Dirty dishes were not removed in a timely manner nor were water glasses filled. Just an odd, outdated place. Felt like I was back in Jersey, without the good food."
"1","I recently visited La Torretta while spending the weekend in Scottsdale. \nService here is great, but everything else about this restaurant is horrible.\n\nWe arrived at 9pm for our dinner reservation there were 4 other tables in the restaurant. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was attentive, comical, and polite. \nWe opted out of appetizers and went straight for entrees. Our food took forever to arrive. We waited about 40 mins for our dinner to arrive. I ordered the halibut special which came with a lemon artichoke/capers sauce with a side of ravioli, and steamed veggies. The halibut was a bit dry and the sauce was not good. It tasted like it came from a can. We also ordered the Lasagna al Saltimbocca. The description reads (Baked hand made wide ribbon pasta with ragu of wild mushrooms, veal and prosciutto) Regrettably, it ended up being regular lasagna with ground beef. There were no mushrooms, no veal, and no prosciutto. \n\nThe worst part of the dining experience was the bill. The halibut was $35 and the lasagna was $22. Frankly, you can get better Italian food at Maggiano's. The great service doesn't justify the overpriced food. Don't waste your hard earned cash at La Torretta."
"1","The first thing you notice is the smell.   If I hadn't have been starving, I would have walked out.   The place is dark and dreary, with a wait staff to match.  Clearly they have their own little dramas going on that trump customer service.  But to be fair, they do all call you \""sweetie\"" and \""honey\""  once they get around to showing up, there's the consolation. My meal came fairly quickly, so no complaints there.\n\nThe food was actually decent.  I had the smoked whitefish salad appetizer, which was a nice plate for a single diner like myself.   The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.\n\nThe problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.  I just kept wondering what state the kitchen was in.   So, despite the decent food, I have to give this place a two star rating.   Maybe call Robert Irvine!   Unless it's freshened up and the smell is gone, I'm not going back.  Not even for such good whitefish salad!"
"2","My Husband and I took my Grandma to Ristorante Giuseppe this evening.  Since it was a weeknight after a storm there was practically no one there, which was fine by me since I already knew this place could get crowded (based on other yelp reviews).  My Husband and I shared the one of the pasta specials, which was baked ziti with all sorts of meats.  It was creamy, cheesy, meat filled goodness.  We also had a salad and garlic bread, which was also unique since it had a kick.  My Grandma had the pork parmigiana, she loved it.\n\nOverall, this is a small Mom and Pop shop and it was VERY good.  It's always nice to support great places like Ristorante Giuseppe that are family owned and have great authentic food!"
"2","I have only been here once, but I cannot wait to go back. My favorite part was the atmosphere. Cheesecake is awesome, the food was so authentic (no Olive Garden menu here!), and the owners even went table to table to chat with everyone. \nVery busy, but still a great experience.\nYou should try it at least once. Bring cash!"
"1","Decided to go here after reading the great reviews but was terribly disappointed in the service.  Waited 40 minutes for a table when for 30 of those minutes we stared at 3 empty tables just waiting for people to be sat at them- they remained empty while my party and 4 other parties waited the full 40 minutes wondering why those tables were remaining empty. \n\nWe were finally sat and waited another 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the server who clearly was more interested in socializing with the other staff members than with providing good customer service to his tables. We finally placed our order after flagging down the server via another employee. We then waited another 45 minutes for our food before the waiter returned and blamed the delay on something that was \""beyond his control\"" and it would be another few minutes,\n\nWe were so annoyed at this point that we told the manager to just box the food up and we would take it to go. To their credit they were apologetic and even threw in 2 free desserts. However, the damage was already done. I guess I would give this place one more chance only because of the great Yelp reviews but I would make for darn sure that we do not get the same waiter with his head in his ass. We ate the food in our hotel room (we are from out of state) is was pretty decent."
"1","Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.\n\nContrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 \""insalata Romana\"" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.   \n\nThis is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when \""eye-talian\"" food was still considered a bit exotic.\n\nThe many reviews stating that this is \""real homemade Italian food\"" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't \""real Italian\"" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.  \n\nN.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not \""just like going to Italy.\""  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!  \n  \nThe mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously. \n\nThe servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be \""east-coast\"" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.\n\nAlso, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare. \n\n$54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks."
"1","Had dinner there Sunday evening.  I have been in the valley 12 years, and this is the worst food that I have ever been served.  A piece of veal that was most  likely left over from Friday or Satuday night.  They probably put it in the microwave.  It could not be cut with a knife, dried out, a grease ball.  They should not serve dreck like that, and charge you for it.  The waiter looked, as far as clean hands, like he just finished doing the yard work there.  A shame that we wasted so much money on a horrible dinner.  Even the pasta they served on the side was total grease.  They took away the large salad we ordered that was half eaten without even asking.   That was rude.\n\nI realize it was a Sunday evening, but, please, do not serve such inferior food, and please wear a clean outfit if you are going to serve the public food.  I will never go back there, and will let my friends know what a horrible experience we had."
"1","I found black hair in my meatball sandwich(I'm blonde), when I confronted the owner he said \""that's possible\"". Extremely disgusting and rude! Didn't even take the sandwich off the bill. Also they only take cash here. Wonder why? Don't go here, unless you like eating hair."
"2","This place is awesome.  Great food, super friendly staff.  Really has a nice warm family feel.  Our daughter has so much fun.  Every time someone who worked here walked by, they would flirt and play with her and she loved the attention.   Awesome place for families to eat in a nice, warm atmosphere.  Highly recommend."
"1","It's a great place to get your teeth worked on.  However, give it about a few months and then you receive a bill in the mail for some balance, even though you paid in full when you were there.  Now, the explanation was that due to the insurance not covering some minimal amount, making it worth it to ruin a good reputation by sending me a bill 5-6 months after.  The lady on the phone said that I just paid the estimate, and not the actual amount.  So why would this place misquote their customers?  I've been to a few dentists, and never has this happened to me, where I paid in full after the procedure was done, and then get another bill 5-6 months later.  Unbelievable.  Even though the dentist does great work on teeth for what you came in for, be careful of additional recommendations for extra($$$) work as it is not necessary to get right away(ex. root canal, crown, etc.),that's if your teeth don't hurt.  Am I going to be looking for a new dentist?  Mostly like yes, until this place gets their billing straightened out.  Remember, I wasn't looking for a freebie, as I paid over $500 to that place, the 5-6 months later bill was minimal, but it's the principal that counts."
"1","Filthy place.  Bad tasteless food.  Rude waitress.  Yuck!!!!"
"2","I absolutely love this hotel. When my boyfriend and I checked in they asked us if we wanted watered bottles, which was really  nice. The look of the hotel was very pretty..when I walked into our room there was a light, nice smelling scent. The room is definitely cleaner than most hotels I've been to. The decor was very pretty as well. In the morning we got free breakfast that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were expecting. Very delicious with bacon, eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would recommend anyone who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. Completely in love with it! Oh and one more thing, we booked through Expedia so our one bed-room was only 40 dollars (tax included) for a Friday night. How cheap is that for such a nice hotel? Definitely go there!"
"2","Dr. Shannon Heck is so amazing with my son.  Has helped my son with issues that his pediatrician could have done but did not.  \nAs for cosmetic procedures...she will not let you look like you just went through a wind tunnel.  You have the option to go anywhere and get injections...She is a Doctor who knows and understands how your body will work with what she is injecting.  How could anyone get injections from someone who is not a doctor!   Its not about the cost per unit.  Remember the saying..\""You get what you pay for\"".  I could not be happier.  5 stars!"
"1","Why do people go to Olive Garden?  Why did i go here today?\nSimple answer: with force.  \nI HAD to go where a member of the family chose to go.  I haven't eaten here in about 8 years.  Many reasons which were confirmed tonight.\nPasta was mushy. The \""famous\"" salad actually had decent flavor but was drenched in dressing.  Breadsticks were a bit hard and tasted like buttered white bread.  Fish was breaded but okay tasting.  Pizza was not so good. Didn't like the cheese.  To sum up the whole meal: it was like heating up a \""t.v. dinner.\"""
"2","I agree with Ebony that sometimes Red Lobster does get a bad rap....but this location is a very good one......as long as you get here early (LOL). This locale is always busy.....but the food.....customer service....and the overall ambience of the place really shines. Molly was our server when the wife and I visited this locale for dinner this past Friday night. Right now they have a 15 dollar 4 course meal promotion.....and I am telling you it was the best 15 bucks I have ever spent. I started with the New England Clam chowder.....this is my favorite soup in the whole world BAR NONE. Then I had the Caesar Salad with the Cheddar Bay biscuits which I always have two baskets of ....because those Biscuits will really make you hurt someone they are so good......(LOL). I had the Shrimp and Grilled Chicken in a great garlic and butter sauce with garlic mashed potatoes.....OMG.....the chicken was so juicy and the potatoes just melted in my mouth.\n\nDessert was a very rich and delicious Key Lime Pie......ALL THIS FOR 15 BUCKS......WOW. I felt like I was stealing in a way (LOL) but again if there is a better deal in the valley for a dinner this good.....please let me know. So run don't walk to you nearest neighborhood Red Lobster and try this deal before it's gone. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
"2","The crab is delicious.\n\nI had bought some gift certificates from another chain that was among a conglomerate of restaurants and Red Lobster was one of the valid restaurants so I used the certificates here.\n\nI got a crab combination meal and an additional 1 lb of crab legs. Yum.\n\nCrab Crab Crab!"
"2","They do up to $50 cash back here, that's unexpected.  This was orig a tip but YELP wants me to review so based on that fact alone 4 stars.  On top of that if you need anything in a pinch like for travel or something its always a good place to go.  Plus you can get balloons here, who doesn't love balloons.  Price range here is literally one dollar sign #JOKES"
"1","Any other casino but gosh dang it!  I hate that \""jackpot hand pay\"" in slot machine is $200 and up. It takes them long time to come pay \""jackpot\"" $200 and they always give me seven $20 and two $10s wait around for $5-$10 tip for slowly bringing \""jackpot\"" $200. Lol \n\nHonestly what casino makes 200$ jackpot ? And expect any tip for it? Most people lose $200 in 10 min on slots. \n\nI wish other casino was closer to me at least their \""jackpot handpay\"" is the standard above 1200  just feel like they r finding way to rip even more money off.... No one want to tip on 200$ when it takes $300 to get it . Make it more convenient and people will happily tip more I'm sure .   Some of the slot people are sooo rude too.   People are losing tons of money daily so it's very bad to be rude ....  \n\nOther than that table games are fine, slot selections are okay, regular staff is okay, it's normal casino.  Please fix the hand pay system."
"1","I've read the reviews before playing and got me interested.  After playing, I'm not sure what you all saw in this course.\n\nI played the North and the South on the same day in mid March as part of our annual mancation.  We paid $320 to play both courses on the same day.  Here are my thoughts.\n\nEither courses lacked any real feature.  They were flat and boring.  No elevation changes, no scenic desert scape and the holes were generally boring in design.  Just a flat course in the middle of the desert.  There are plenty of better courses in Phoenix that are cheaper and way more entertaining and challenging for much lower price (500 club, ASU Karsten, Papago, Dove Valley, etc...).  If you want to pay this kind of price and enjoy the scenery as well as challenge, try TPC Scottsdale, Ocotillo, Raven, Triology, Troon North for starter).  I'm not opposed to high green fees just as long as they provide value.\n\nOn the day of the course, the greens were rock hard and didn't hold a single ball - not even a nine iron on to the front of the green.  When we got done, none of us walked away with 'oh, what about that hole' with any enthusiasm.  For the price we paid, this was not much better than a muni track.  Sorry TalkingStick, you're just a stick.\n\nOn the positive, the staff was generally friendly and helpful.  However, the Marshall did nothing to keep the guys in front of us at pace with the group in front of them.  I suppose that's why they took the 'Marshall' tile away and gave them more benign 'player assistant' title."
"2","Over Labor Day Weekend I went to Home Depot looking to start a remodel on my kitchen. I needed to start with a new refrigerator, stove and microwave. My last experience with Sears made me promise myself I would never buy another thing from them. \n\nWell... I had a fantastic experience at The Mt. View location in Scottsdale, Wes, our salesman made good points on the items I was looking at. No pressure, and he took a lot of time with me. great experience and when the delivery was made, the men that delivered were good, setting everything up. Home Depot you have my business."
"2","This place is ah-mazing.  It's a family-owned business and they came from LA to Arizona to setup shop.  \n\nThe sushi is so yummy.  We had Toro and a rainbow roll.  The quality of fish is excellent.  I also had the udon noodle soup which I split with my mom.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a chilly winter day.  You can split it easily, and they bring you the bowls and spoons to do so.  It even has a soft boiled egg in it! Yummy\n\nThe menu has more than standard rolls, there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from!\n\nThey also had hot green tea that was so good.\n\nThis place is intimate and welcoming, definitely worth becoming a regular at!"
"1","We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\n\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade."
"1","Rude old man manager was a total scrooge this holiday season.  Salespeople are too busy pimping nooks to treat customers w respect.  Luckily the cafe workers were lovely\n\nI miss the way this establishment used to b when it opened"
"2","I'm only reviewing the Pets Hotel here, just to be clear. I take my dog here probably 1-3 times a week for daycare and have since she was old enough to go. The staff there is great. They have gotten to know my dog really well and they take great care of her anytime she is there. I never have to worry when I drop her off there-I know Lissie, Cheyennea, and everyone else will take great care of her."
"2","We know Richard for 18 years. Our pets our family he saved and with much patience explains everything going on with our \""girls\"" the senior staff dr nick and the grooming staff have been wonderful. Dr. Brown operated on one of our girls and  with his expertise is running jumping (which got her into trouble in the first place) and back to herself ! 5 stars aren't enough"
"1","The produce and meat department are excellent but terribly over priced!! I find it quite interesting that they say their seafood has never been frozen, yet we live in the desert? Yesterday I bought some tilapia for $12.99/lb. That's really expensive for tilapia! I wanted to get some Chilean Sea bass but that was $36.99/lb!! Really??? I can get it cheaper in a restaurant and at least they cook it for you!"
"1","Where is he? Where is my uncle? \n\nThere was a time and a place when I loved Uncle Sam's.. huge tasty cheesesteaks.. wonderful fried mushrooms and zucchini plus some of the best ranch dressing Ive ever had! I would brag about how awesome this place was until I took a few friends there. This place has gone from awesome to chintzy over salted frozen bag fried yuck! \n\nCheesesteaks are super salty to a degree that makes them inedible.. the ranch dressing tastes out of a jar.. and the ex-yummy fried foods seem like they came from a freezer bag. What a real disappointment.. what happened? Change owners? The staff used to be so friendly now they seem they could care less. \n\nI miss my uncle.. he used to love me in a very special way."
"2","Love this place. I always get the hoagie grinder and my husband gets the chicken Parm. My sandwich normally makes a great lunch the next day, depending in how hungry I am. This is a Phoenix staple that everyone should try."
"2","The wings here are excellent.  The \""suicide\"" heat level is not ridiculously hot, but very tasty and they aren't over-powered by vinegar as too many other places do.  My wife loves the white pizza with garlic.  They are generous on the cheese and the thin crust is very tasty and well done.  Service is always good."
"1","Wish I could give negative stars.\n\nCalled ahead to verify they were open for business, was told that \""everything was warming up\"", but yes, they were open.\n\nArrived at 9:36, left at 10:01.\n\nMy g/f waited at least five minutes to be seated, while I went to use the restroom.\n\nAlso, your waitress took my g/f's order and brought drinks, but never came back to the table after I came out of the restroom. And my g/f said the waitress wasn't even in her uniform yet, and changed after she took the order.\n\nNever received the appetizer, never had my order taken.\n\nSeriously, get some softer fucking toilet paper and paper towels. That's a really chickenshit way to make more profit."
"1","I like Goldies and we take out often because the food is usually good but, honestly, they cannot get orders correct. Every single take out order is wrong. either they forget something or they undercook something, like wings that are called in to be well done. And when they make a mistake, they do not take responsibilty for it. They charge for everything including ranch dressing which I feel is insulting. Again the food is good but, under these circumstances, we will go elsewhere."
"2","Fitness Experience is great!  The trainers are very knowledgeable and always willing to answer any questions I have.  My personal training sessions have really brought my workouts to the next level.  I get a program specifically designed for me, follow it for a bit, and then when I'm ready for a new challenge I meet with my trainer, Sunny, for another program.  \n\nThe gym is not over crowded like some of the big chain gyms that I've been too.  I can always get on the equipment that I want.  It's a small enough size that you get to know the trainers and other members on a first name basis, but it's big enough to have all the equipment you need."
"2","Little strange at first, but I have to admit service was great and I was very happy with the way my vehicle performed afterward. A little pressure for extras but overall happy with the experience."
"2","The best OBGYN practice you will find in Phoenix. Dr. Hlavachek is caring, attentive, and a real person that connects with you as another woman, not just a patient."
"2","Decent place great service no frills!  I had a gel pedicure with a hot stone massage for $35.  Happy camper"
"1","Impressed with a cheery hello as soon as we walked in.\n \nThen, noticed the booth table needed scrubbing, it was sticky. Ketchup bottle very very dirty, floor dirty, windows dirty. It was a dirty place.\n\nFood good, pancakes nothing special as the name might imply. We might give it another try to see if they have learned restaurant basics, like providing a clean restaurant for customers.\n\nPlace needs help."
"1","12/03/12\n\nHmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)\n\nCousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...\n\nWe arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""Golden brown\"" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \""yes.\""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \n\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!\n\nAlso, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(\n\n*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days..."
"1","service was very slow and it wasn't that busy. I had an omelette it was ok but the single piece of toast was dry and over toasted, my friend had pancakes and loved them.\nGroupon made it better"
"2","The Melting Pot is a dining EXPERIENCE. If you get a private booth, it can be a very romantic dining experience. \n\nHeres the deal...As mentioned in other reviews, the food is good but not amazing (except for dessert!). Set aside a good 2 1/2 - 3 hours for dinner, drinks and conversation. It takes a while. If you are one of those who likes to order, eat and get the hell out...this is not the place for you. Be ready to relax, have a few drinks and take your time. The cheese course, salad and main course are there as distractions. The spotlight is firmly held on the dessert course! Its freeking amazing!!! We haven't had a dessert at the melting pot that we didn't LOVE!"
"2","This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat. Here is my guide to having a 5 star experience at this restaurant. \n\n1. Make reservations a few weeks in advance to be sure to get the time slot you are interested it. They fill up fast.\n\n2. Go for an occasion, not a holiday. Go because its your birthday, or you are celebrating a big business deal. Not on Valentines Day. This is not me saying it would be bad on Valentine's Day, but most people get frustrated when its busy at places like this and don't realize that, well, yeah...its VALENTINE'S DAY. (If you can set the right expectations then HECK YEAH go on Valentine's Day)\n\n3. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT take your kids here. It is not that the staff wouldn't be amazing to your kids, it is the fact that most people are here for a quiet night out, not a screaming 2 year old. (I leave my screaming 2 year old at home.) Here's the catch, if your kid is old enough to enjoy a good meal and experience and you would like some one on one time with them to perhaps congratulate them on good grades etc, this may not be a bad idea. Again...screaming 2 year old = NO.\n\n4. Finding deals for this place is also a good tip. Sometimes you will see coupons in your local mailer, or you can sign up for their newsletter. If not prepare yourself for a high bill. Same as when you go to Fogo de Chao. You know you are going to a nice place, you also know you are paying for it. Go in with a good mindset and be expecting it and it wont shock you, either that or drink some of their fabulous cocktails and then you wont care!\n\n5. Booths with privacy curtains. Don't ask. However be aware that they do have them and they can be fun. (Assuming here, I have never sat in one).\n\n6. Last but not least and most important. I do not care if you are on a diet, or diabetic, or hate chocolate (what kind of nut are you). Make time, don't eat for a week, take insulin, and have the chocolate fondue. This is absolutely amazing and worth the trip every time!\n\nFollow my 6 steps and you will have a great time at The Melting Pot!"
"1","ok so, first of all, if i had known we had to cook our own food i never would have gone here. second of all, the cheese was good but not $16 good. the food was ok, but if you get something different from your date you still share the same pot so the flavors get all muddled. plus, the lighting is very dim in this restaurant so it was very hard for me to tell if my pork, chicken, shrimp and any other must be fully cooked foods were fully cooked. i must say, their curry sauce was amazing, and so were the chocolate covered strawberries, which is why i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. i will not be back to throw away close to $100. i can go to ruth's chris and have an amazing meal for that price. i'm very disappointed."
"1","We were here 3 - yes I typed three - hours for a meal with two little kids.  Very long waits between the courses with no attention from server.  Of the three hours at least 60 full minutes was spent without any food in front of us.  But the best part, incorrect charges on the bill.  Wines prices upcharged on actual receipt to 1.5X the price listed on the menu.  I asked the manager on duty why there was a discrepancy and he went behind the bar, got some cash and gave it to me.  Now mind you, it was of course, no where near the amount I was overcharged but I guess it relieved his conscience.  He handed me the money and said \""It will take me too long to find out who your server was and look up the transaction, so here you go.\""  Unreal!  Food was average to below average and prices for what you get were a real rip off.  Original style broth that was recommended was so chock full of pepper you were downing water all night - if you could get a refill.  Save your money and time - go buy a fondue pot and do it at home.  You do all your own cooking here anyway so why not.  Will not return.  Hope this saves others a bad experience as well."
"2","Great anniversary dinner. Justifiably recommended by our friends.  Lovely and decadent. We loved it"
"2","I've been here a few times. A couple of times with the husband to enjoy a Groupon and a special menu option. And twice for ladies night with the co-workers since they do a special ladies night menu the first Tuesday of every month - which has a good price for all you get!\n\nWe almost always call ahead and make reservations - on ladies night, a reservation is a MUST since it fills up quickly.  The staff is always really friendly and they are more than happy to walk you through the process if you are new here.  The drinks are strong and the food comes in stages so you can really make this an great date night.  \n\nI'd be torn to choose between the cheese appetizer and the chocolate dessert for my favorite part of the meal, but since I'm more of a sweet than salty fan, I'll go with the dessert.  They always have special check-in offers and from time to time they offer Groupons, as well.  If you sign up online for their mailing list, you'll get some decent offers there, too!\n\nOverall: A\nA great spot for a date night experience, ladies night out, or special dinner for a loved one! Be sure to seek out specials since it can get a touch pricey."
"1","Made reservations and still waited 15 minutes in the lobby awkwardly as no one was paying attention to us. This was my first time at the melting pot so I had no idea what to expect but after waiting and finally being seated we sat at the table for another 15 minutes before the waitress showed up and awkwardly/reluctantly introduced herself. Anyways, we got the new cheese fondue thing they had, and the coppa bean something rather. Not my favorite fondue or broth but the filet mignon was delicious regardless as was the ahi tuna.  All in all, I hope I will never have to go back, It just isn't my cup of tea apparently."
"2","This place was amazing! The staff was friendly and informative and the food was delicious. Our server Ashley (not sure if that's the right spelling) was sweet and friendly, she even asked if it was alright if she used us to train a newbie first, which was very considerate. The newbie, who I forgot her name, did a spectacular job even though we could tell she was nervous. My only complaint was that the prices were insanely high. I wouldn't recommend going unless you had a coupon or are prepared to pay at least $30 a person. I also felt a little under dressed, but that's not the restaurants fault. Everything else was good though, and I will return in the future!"
"1","Don't go here!  I went it for a bang trim and hair cut and came home with an uneven mess.  My hair is naturally straight with NO layers or anything else.  All I asked for was to have my bangs trimmed and the ends trimmed up to get rid of split ends.  When I came home I was embarrassed at how my hair looked.  It was unbelievable how uneven the bangs were and the ends of the rest of my hair was.  I would not recommend going here.  Also, the stylist I had wasn't very friendly and even criticized me for straightening my hair everyday."
"1","The club is clean and well maintained.  The staff is polite, helpful and knowledgable.  There are a variety of classes offered throughout the day.  These are the hallmarks of a great club and Gainey Village has them.\n\nThe problem for me is the unventilated fryer/grill snack stand in the middle of the club.  The smell of fryers and griddles is absolutely thick in the air throughout the entire club like a stale Denny's.  This club used to limit its offerings to healthy wraps, smoothies and salads.  No problem - you could take it or leave it.  Bad enough a \""health\"" club serves fried foods, it does so without ventilating the fryer smoke through a proper commercial hood.\n\nThe heavy, oppressive greasy smell of the place is absolutely off putting and not the setting for a workout that one might want, unless the Village's target audience is now kids who crave greasy fast food.  Unless you get the urge to workout each time you smell fatty smoke, I suggest you consider whether you are willing to adjust your workout schedule to times when the improperly ventilated fried food stand in the middle of the club is closed."
"2","Love coming here. Usually get the spicy white meat chicken combo. The spring roll makes the meal for me. Friendly staff and owner (Marlene)."
"1","Samurai Sam's tries hard at creating some Asian inspired food\n\nThe three of us came here last week, each ordering something different. I had three chicken tacos which were good, but had virtually no meat. As you can see from the photos, it's hard to find any. Lots of veggies though.\n\nAs for my friends, they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls. Both came with a lot of rice, but again not much else.\n\nSadly, you can get  nearly twice as much food at Panda Express.  It's hard to justify coming back, our bill came to $24.70, including two soft drinks and one water. So, Two Stars and yes, we have had better.\n\nSorry!"
"1","Went in to change from IPhone to Galaxy, the lady working there acted like is was a real imposition to have to wait on me.  Told me they charged $20 the transfer my info from old Verizon phone to new Verizon phone, ok that I understand.   She said we would have to change our plan even though we had not purchased the phone from Verizon, ask her to check and make sure that was correct.  She then started texting on her phone and left me standing.  After a while her associate came over and helped me. I did not have to change plans and even though it took over 4 hours to transfer the info I finally got it done.  If you would rather chat and text with your friends I suggest you do not get a job that requires customer service."
"2","Honestly, I might go broke if I lived within the general vicinity of this mecca of grocery stores.... This is the creme de le creme of Fry's, hands down the best single grocery store in all of Metro Phoenix.\n\n~What To Do~\nWay too much. First you can shop for pretty much any specific grocery need you can think of. They have a Coldstone inside....yes, Coldstone. They have a coffee shop, a car rental counter, a valet.... they also have a cigar/wine bar which specializes in wine flights...and a top flight sushi station. *gasps for breath*\n\n~The Good~\nOh, there is so much good. This place is stocked to the gills with extras that we can only dream of at other locations. Their specialty bread area, with artisan breads is surprising. The wine bar looks nice, although I haven't personally tried it myself. Its hard to explain this spot, other than it is a Fry's on steroids. The food is a bit nicer, and each aisle or section has different higher end items that you just don't see elsewhere. This is Fry's answer to Whole Foods and Sprouts, yet at a Costco size level. You simply must go... like Nike, Just Do It.\n\n~The Bad~\nWELL..... If you need a scooter, your battery might run out trying to see everything (I'm sorry about that God, that was my bad). If you loathe walking, in other words, then do not go here... All joking aside, the only negative I see is the location. It serious just plays directly to its clientele, upper class Scottsdalians (or w/e you call them, haha). People like myself in Central Phoenix and he surrounding cities are left in the dust, and its completely out of the question thinking about driving to shop here. Ha ha, no way. That's my biggest issue, just simply the fact that they placed this so far away from the other cities... meh..\n\n~The Down Low~\nDespite the location issue, this place is too great to lose even a half a star. There is too much good stuff.  5 stars for the typical good service, large selection, additional never-before-seen amenities, and the comparability of service to that of higher-end grocery chains. This place steps its game way up. Scottsdale, you are lucky!!!!!!!!"
"1","This is supposed to provide veterinary services and they do have professionals on the premises. A few years ago this store did help us with a dog having problems. Today they weren't doing so well. We needed a prescription from our Oregon vet filled. My wife called three times to confirm it could  be done and get a fax number. Our vet faxed it. We then visited a crowded, hectic waiting room and after 15 minutes found they don't fill prescriptions. I understand licensing though I don't understand why they don't have a license to sell dog medicine. My problem is that they didn't tell us they couldn't until we had considerable time invested. It didn't help that there was no acceptance of responsibility."
"2","Every time that I have been to this location.  I always leave happy.  Not only do I love their $ menu, but each time, the service is great.  They are always asking me how my day has been and more importantly, they are smiling.  I love that."
"1","I went for my first time to this nail salon and I will never go back.  The woman who did my nails talked the entire time to other manicurists in Vietnamese or whatever which in itself is rude and makes one feel paranoid that they are being talked about.  That would have been tolerable if the manicure itself had been worth it but it was a terrible manicure that lasted two days at most and some nails are are chipping and jagged already. I am a once a week client of manicures so my nails have been very well taken care of- until this week."
"1","Although Mimi was very nice, my manicure was horrible in every way a manicure can go badly. \n1. Polish so thick I have air bubbles on every nail. \n2. Completely uneven polish by the cuticles. Honestly, I do a much better job myself. \n3. It's been almost 2 hours now and it's STILL not dry and looks like an elephant stepped on my nails. \n4. The place was not very well ventilated and it's clear they rarely clean the place because there was a layer of dust everywhere. \nI would never go there again."
"1","WAS expecting the deliciousness of In-N-Out times two plus the options of Five Guys.... NOPE. Pretty much glorified cafeteria food. Hard store-bought bun, white iceburg lettuce, and limp pickles.\n\nNo unusual hamburger combos (like blue cheese, arugula, etc). No juicy beef patty. No fresh, ripe ingredients. No like!\n\nPlus the sodium on their fries is enough to cause a person to contract acute pitting edema :)\n\nWhy all the hype??"
"2","Dr. Sotelo is a Buckeye's fan, how can you go wrong here?  \n\nBeside being from the same area in the Midwest as Dr. Sotelo I have been taking our children here for several years.  We have always been treated well by the staff and Dr. Sotelo.  There is hardly any issues with scheduling an appointment and they don't make you wait forever in the waiting room or the exam room.\n\nI saw Dr. Cannon for the firstime on my last visit there and was pleased with his evaluation and treatment of my daughters issues."
"1","Had a bad car repair experience with them.  Wanted to give them credit for their efforts to fix the situation but when I picked up my car they missed bolting down some stuff under the hood.  I would have driven off with wires, etc. dangling had I not done my own inspection before leaving the shop.  So, as it turns out I do not recommend this place."
"2","The only items worth getting here are the pollo blanco enchiladas, the chimichanga or the mexican pizza. The trifecta will not disappoint. If you order anything else, don't come complaining to me!"
"1","Sad to say, Ajo Al's continues to slide downhill.  At two recent trips we were served food that was obviously not freshly prepared - for example, eggs with chorizo which suspiciously had no trace of oil.  How is this possible since chorizo is so fatty?  Answer - the chorizo had been pre-cooked and then dumped into an egg mixture.  The result was burnt on the bottom but the cheese melted on top and the extremely hot plate told me it had been heated again, probably in an \""alligator\"".  The result was dry, almost tasteless, and completely unsatisfying.  \n\nYou want more - the chips were stale; the booth we were seated in had one normal side and one side where the seat was so low it would have been impossible to eat at it.  This could be fixed -- if anyone cared.\n\nI've pretty much given up on you, Ajo.  Don't you know the mantra of today is fresh, fresh, fresh?"
"2","Nice helpful Staff! I would give them 6 Stars if I could! The Manager Andy always greets us with a smile. If you are interested in a mailbox or just shipping a package, this is the place. Thank you Mail-N-office."
"1","Had @CousinsSubs for lunch Tuesday.\n\nThe person at the counter was very nice, and gave me the combo price for a bag of chips, even though I didn't buy them at the same time.\n\nThat being said, the 2-for-$5 sandwiches were not anything remotely approaching \""a good value\"".\n\nThe floor had visible mop streaks, likely from already-filthy water, the tables were sticky, there was a large collection of baskets on top of the trash can.\n\nI would not return here unless there was nothing else available."
"2","Four words: Italian Special Garlic Bread. Scrumptious. The place is a decent value if you get the large and share. Average sandwich shop decor. Super friendly grey haired owner/manager as well as the one male employee who I swear has been there forever. Always forget to get a coupon. I see them in Airpark News."
"1","Biggest complaint I had with this place is the cleanliness.  Floor was pretty dirty and the legs of the chairs were gross.  The sandwich was ok, wouldn't run out and get another one because it was fantastic.   I asked for a side of yellow mustard and he gave me Heinz mustard packets which is usually no big deal, but the mustard inside these packets was gross.  I think it might have been way over its expiration date.  I had to scrape it off."
"1","Not a fan of my sandwich being tossed into the microwave twice. I think they heated up the turkey in the microwave and then they decided to melt the cheese in the micro as well. This was the turkey rueben and it was a pretty lame move on these guys part, especially when I see a flattop grill right below the microwave. Bread would have been crispier and the sandwich as a whole would have been great, but even these two local women decide to take shortcuts and the results are a soggy sandwich made by lazy cooks/owners. They still use quality turkey, but the rest is a joke."
"2","I have been seeing Dr. Kumaraswamy for almost a year. She is bright, articulate, caring, understanding and nothing short of great! She has done a few procedures on me that have been life changing! She is the epitome of what a doctor should be.\nThe office staff are very proficient , kind and professional. It's a rarity to wait more than 5 minutes.\nThank you Dr. K and SW Sport and Spine"
"2","Awesome bagels, nice people."
"2","Not only are their bagels delicious, but they have THE BEST COFFEE in the valley, hands down.  Add a touch of cream and a little sweetener to their hazelnut vanilla brew or their breakfast blend for a slightly less sweeter version and it's practically HEAVEN in cup.  I'm not kidding.  I am a serious coffee drinker (couldn't tell ,could you?) and I am very picky.  So picky that before I discovered Lox, I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough.  However, now that I have had the glorious coffee from Lox Stock & Bagel even my own coffee doesn't measure up.  I literally stop by and pick up a cup from there almost every day. YUMMMM!"
"1","I am surprised by all of these great reviews.  People comparing this place to bagels from New York.  No comparison whatsoever!  They lack any kind of flavor and the flavored cream cheeses barely contain anything to flavor them - very skimpy.  Great neighborhood atmosphere and I really wanted to love this place, but sadly will not return."
"1","As relocated New Yorkers, we have searched for a good deli to satisfy our noshing needs. Sadly, this is not that place. The bagels tasted like Wonder Bread. You can get better Nova at Costco. The one thing NYC you ask? The prices! WAY too high given the mediocre food. So, We keep looking ..."
"2","Our go-to neighborhood bar. This Zipp's far outweighs the Camelback location, in  my opinion. Maybe it's the more \""in-tune\"" servers or just the overall better quality of food - but we always choose this one to quench our wing and beer cravings! Their medium buffalo wings are the best in the valley that I've personally had and their happy hour drink specials cannot be beat. It's hard to find a really good happy hour  but these guys do it right. If you want a good premium pint, a dozen medium wings and good service overall - Zipps' on Via De Ventura is the spot you should choose!"
"1","I enjoy most Zipps locations but this one has the worst management of all of all Zipps. Truly rude and definitely incompetent. Food is greasy and cheap but a decent place to watch the game over a drink with friends, however there are too many other options around here to waste your time and money at this place."
"1","I attend Zipps often, however this Zipps on Via De Ventura, was not impressive. I invited a fairly large group of friends to come out Sunday to watch the playoffs. Sitting outside was not an issue since they had TV screens and a lot of tables that were empty. The problem was there were no heaters outside, no wonder it was empty. Now I know this is Arizona, but it gets pretty chilly outside in the winter especially when the area is shaded. Fifteen of my friends left and went elsewhere because it was too cold outside. Dollars out the door if you ask me. I ended up getting a booth inside with a few of us that decided to stay because you can't beat the happy hour prices for food and drinks anywhere else, but I froze my ass off the entire time. \n\nMy service was good with my first waitress, however when the next one showed up I had to flag her down for drinks as well as for my bill. Now if the place was packed I could totally understand the slow service, however it was a lot less empty then when I first arrived."
"1","I've lived at San Antigua for about 3 years.  My apartment is not updated, which is fine with me, because it saves me money (and I work only a mile away, so the commute is fantastic).  They did put in all new appliances about a year and a half ago, but I think they are the lowest quality possible. The original microwave had a tag inside that it was manufactured in August 1993 and it was not pretty.  But it was clean and it worked better than my new one.  Same with the other appliances. I would have been happy if they had replaced the washer with a efficient front loader!  But the one I have doesn't even have a delicate cycle.  I wash all of my work clothes in lingerie bags (I have about 10 now) to protect them from the beating they would get in that washer.\n\nI have had a few maintenance requests, and they have usually come right away.  I noticed comments about the water being off, and the water was off often.  Once until late at night (when the notice said during the day only) and there was no way to get an update.  It was very inconvenient and annoying, but that is resolved.\n\nMy main issue is with the office staff, which is what is driving me to write today.  The two main ladies I've interacted with in the last year (I think one is gone now, but her replacement is no better) are not helpful at all.  Last year I was going to be away for 4 weeks and I asked about how I could handle my rent and my water bill payment (I was to return on the 4th of the month).  I could pay my rent ahead of time (not ideal, but that's fine). But for the water bill, I should pay more than the amount I paid for that month to make sure I covered next months, because they charge you a late fee if you are one day late.  I think they should have worked with me for the $20 water bill that would have been 5 days late.  Their attitude was \""too bad\"" and they weren't even nice about it.\n\nThere used to be a drop box that I would drop my rent into on my way to work on the first, but that is now gone. You can pay your rent online now, but the water bill doesn't show up on your account until sometime on the 1st usually after 10 am (I can usually pay at lunch time and its there).  Today however, I went to pay a little after noon, and the water bill did not yet show up on my account.  I called the office and was told they were having trouble with getting the water bill online. I could bring a check in to the office.  I pointed out they don't have a drop box anymore.  She pretty much said I would be charged a late fee if I didn't pay today.  So I hope I remember to go back online to pay that portion and I have to hope it is there to pay. Its like I get a 6 - 8 (if I'm lucky) hour window to pay the rent and I better make it work with my life.  It is very frustrating and annoying.  I've never had issues like this any where else I have lived.\n\nLast year I probably would have rated them 4 stars, but with my issues with the office staff, I am down to 2.  And I'm considering moving out when my lease is up in the fall."
"2","I loved living here!  \n\nI have lived at San Antigua for almost a year.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here.  Yes, the units are dated, but wonderful floorplans, very clean, spacious decks, extra storage, actual laundry rooms (older equipment, but works great).  I am a single woman and feel completely safe despite often arriving home late.  I LOVE that they allow pets by breed (not size).  \n\nThe award-winning grounds are outstanding with something beautiful blooming year-round and well maintained palm, pine and native trees.  There is a wonderful greenbelt where my dog loves to run each morning and meet his many pals - a virtual playground for the dogs.  The adjacent golfcourse and walking/biking path is easy to access and another beautiful place to walk.  the many varieties of migrating birds are spell-binding from geese and ducks to beautiful huge blue heron and two or three kinds of all white birds - snow geese? egrets? not sure, but I counted over 40 of them one day in the golf course lakes.  \n\nWhile the pool furniture may be older - it is in very acceptable condition -- the area is super clean, the pools and fountains are beautiful and well-maintained. The gym and common areas as well.  \n\nThe maintenance staff is super responsive and friendly, as are the groundskeepers.  The office staff is helpful, and responsive, but seem to have their hands tied by a less caring management.  You definitely get the feel that the complex is not a labor of love, but about business and the bottom line.  And, in fairness, it is a business, not a condominium complex. Doing more would increase the rents which I thought for all you get were very reasonable.  If they were condos,  I would buy in here in a minute.  Also, people who live here are friendly, respectful, all ages,  and it is very quiet - unlike several other complexes I considered. The unique 3-bedroom units are great for families.  Also,the central location and easy access to 101 is ideal. I am very sorry to be heading back North and leaving San Antigua, but will remember my time here very positively.  Would highly reccomend to anyone."
"1","I was not impressed with this clinic. \nPros:\n1. The vet did tell us where to find pet meds for a cheaper price\n\nCons: \n1.Their website was not up to date as far as their location and address. \n2. The staff was not very friendly. \n3. I felt very rushed to get in and out \n4. Received a card in the mail and thought it might be a welcome note but it was a request for referrals!"
"1","If you really LIKE cold seafood, tepid prime rib, then THIS is the restaurant for you!  Table of eight, seated quickly, waiter was a little flustered and brought the wrong item completely for one of our friends.  It happens. Our plates were well presented, and the meal looked fabulous, but it was cold.  Shrimp was cold, salmon was cold, fries were cold.  Three diners sent their plates back.  The prime rib was tepid, and the potatoes were warm.  Not hot.  So the diners who didn't have food simply entertained the ones who were eating.  That's the one star.  The waiter apologized, the manager apologized.  She didn't offer to comp ANYTHING, she didn't offer dessert or a glass of wine.  Oh, and the tip was already on the bill, 18%....which was probably a good thing for our inept waiter.  Don't bother, there are plenty of great places in Scottsdale to dine."
"1","Was expecting a lot more for the price. Their focus is on seafood and I was expecting at least average is not better but it really missed the mark for me. Portions small and seafood not its freshest. Ambiance was nice but a little dated in the lighting and furniture."
"1","Very dated..."
"1","Mmmmm....If you can get past the musty and damp carpet smell (prob from the \""lake\"" humidity), the food is pretty decent!!!! \n\nHey Buster's! Replace your carpet for Pete's sake (and clean it frequently once you do!)"
"2","Spent a week there on business. Like others, the bar, pools, Spa, and staff were all amazing. \n\nGot a deal on Priceline too, so it was easier on the wallet.\n\nGreat place, if you have to be in PHX, its worth the drive to Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale."
"1","This is made of cinderblock and cement. If that is your aesthetic taste, go for it.  My room flooded twice, my patio flooded, the hallway ceiling was caving in, and it took 3 days to fix it.  And to be frank, no one at the hotel seemed to care. There are too many other nice hotels and resorts in the Scottsdale area to stay at this one."

OK, the pool is OK, but the Fairmont has a much nicer pool and kids area that is much more seperate than here.  Ugh!\n\nAnd having one restaurant open and just basically a pool does NOT make it  a resort. *btw, there is a $15 daily resort fee!"
"2","love the cozy fireplaces in winter, uncrowded/classy bar, flaminco dancers, waterslide, beach pool, lots of jacuzzi's, friendly staff, relaxing couches"
"2","I have never stayed here, but when I lived in Scottsdale, I spent a lot of Saturday nights here.  Talk about tranquil, beautiful, relaxing........I've had drinks, I've sung karaoke, I've listened to some great music, I've taken gondola rides and been serenaded only in Italian by the gondolier's operatically trained voices, I've eaten dinner at their wonderful restaurant.  I've sat outdoors with the paradise-like vegetation, I've walked by their sandy beach area and the wading pool.  I just love this place.  Maybe someday I'll even stay here."
"1","Just checked into our room with a family of four. The sleeping was a bit tight with four of us on two double beds. I called the front desk to ask for a cott for one of the young ones and the woman at the front desk flat out refused. She said they were only available for a King Room. She said you csn check our website to see for yourself. Not a great way to make an impression on guests who literally checked in minutes earlier and who are staying for a few nights. I've had better reception from the front desk staying at a Holiday Inn."
"1","The hotel ground and pool area is pretty nice and well kept . The staff are friendly but not so helpful. For instance gave us no advise of where to walk the dog or which areas we're supposed to keep the dog away from. Also when we scheduled the room service for the next day( you have to let them know if you have a dog in the room in advance) and took the dog for a walk and came back and the room wasn't cleaned after 2 hours. The rooms are dusty and don't feel clean . The carpets in the rooms and hallways are old and don't look or feel clean. The air conditioner in the rooms wasn't working \nAnd they brought us a floor heater which wasn't enough to keep the room warm in the cold winter.The  4 paws program costs $150 per 6 day stay and all they gave us was an old dirty pet bed and a pet dish which we didn't think was clean to use .The towels in the room were old and felt like they've been used for many many years. Overall the ground and the pools were the nicest part of the hotel and the rooms were the worst part of the hotel did not feel like a five star hotel. Oh and the beds are super uncomfortable and so as the pillows. We were here for our first year wedding anniversary and it was noted in the reservation but not once was acknowledged. The food is pricey and not really worth it . Two orders of salmon and a guacamole and chips starter cost us almost $70 . The next day we went out and shopped for dinner."
"2","We have rented a property for two years under the managment of this company.  He has been responsive to all of our phone calls, emails and txt's.  We have had several issues in the two years on our rental property and he has responded to them all.  We have appreciated his managment of our lease and would recommend him to our friends."
"2","Had a couple entrees delivered and I was disappointed. After reading the mix of reviews here I knew what to expect - good chinese food. I wasn't let down. The spicy entrees were spicy, the breading was what east coast chinese offers and the rice was just sticky enough.\nOverall we had a good meal and it wasn't pricey. \nWe will definitely be ordering from here again!"
"1","I've stayed here several times over several years. The decor is nice, the setting is serene, and the beds are comfortable. But, I can't imagine staying here except through name your own price bids on Priceline. I would bid a lower star level on Priceline, except for fear of getting some unlikely but dreadful outcome. Bidding for Scottsdale Conference Center, more Conference Center than Resort, is risk management. Sadly, I've never gotten a (different) resort in Scottsdale to take my bid. Many complain about the resort fee and the location of the self-parking. I don't love these either, but I think they're immaterial. (More thoughts on the resort fee at the end.)\n\nI have not raised any of the following concerns before this review, because it seems futile. I have never used the pool. Why would I? It and the surroundings are forgettable compared to many relatively pedestrian hotels in the metro area and elsewhere. Also, the chemicals in the hot tub were so strong that they bleached my trunks. The chairs in the room are uncomfortable (and I don't think they are antiques, which might be worth having even if not comfortable). There are some really simple fails that I can't believe the hotel doesn't fix, and the lack of effective response seems to speak to the hotel's lack of concern for guest satisfaction...1. If you can actually get it brewed, the in-room coffee is vile--yes, vile. Remember to bring your own coffee with you, if you like having decent coffee before going out in the morning. 2. The coffee pots are dysfunctional--they get stuck regularly and don't complete brewing; the carafe is practically impossible to remove from the apparatus, which gets messy. 3. Why do the sinks still not have hot water reliably!? When the dust settles, I am still very satisfied at the name your own price rates I have obtained, but I would be irate if I paid what the hotel asks publicly.\n\nAs an aside, the hot water at the sink still doesn't work several months after the other review complaining about this issue, and I've stayed in several different rooms at the property. In light of this, the management's repeated cheeky form response (to that reviewer and to other yelpers on different issues) to the effect of \""hope you aired your concerns so they could be addressed while you were there\"" seems hollow and phony. Frankly, I didn't need a smoking gun to divine that--it is apparent from the tone of the replies. I don't know why the hotel bothers to respond to these reviews if it's not going to do so effectively; it just makes things worse. I actually felt much better about staying here before I read the management's responses! I would prefer negligence and neglect over calculated disdain. I may share my views with the management via email or in person--hopefully it will go to someone other than the person who apparently monitors yelp.\n\nHere is my longwinded take on the \""resort fee\"" (a common theme on this page). It  strikes me as essentially cosmetic for an informed consumer, given that practically all resorts in the local market are charging a similar fee (it's more of an issue when non-resort (in Priceline parlance) hotels charge a \""resort fee\""). But that doesn't make it ok. If the fee is per rooms, it should be built into the price. Otherwise, it is annoying. I can only think of two reasons to break it out separately, neither of which inspires confidence from the consumer's point of view. The most likely is that the hotel wants to trick someone who isn't likely to be a repeat customer. The other is to send a signal along the lines of \""we're special, and you're paying more because you're getting more.\"" (A resort fee is a star on a Sneetch's belly.) This, however, makes absolutely no sense, because resort amenities vary dramatically just like any other hotel amenities, and travelers generally make decisions about how much to pay for hotel-apples and hotel-oranges based on a holistic assessments. Resort amenities are no different from views, location, furnishings, staff, etc. It is obvious that most people don't read disclosures--the goal of most people who write them is to have plausible deniability but not to help the reader. A per person resort fee might make some sense, but that's not how they charge."
"1","If you decide to rent from hertz , go to the stand alone location on Scottsdale rd north of Mckellips. Avoid getting a car from this hotel location at all costs!!! I reserved a car and was supposed to pick it up at this hotel at 9 am... The hertz rep didn't get there until 11am... I kindly asked if I could get an upgrade or something for the 2 hr wait, and the rep tells me ( as he had the keys to the car on the desk already) that he would knock 30 off the price but could upgrade me for another 30 which would be a wash total price wise but I'd be getting a car with a sunroof, gps, yada yada... He pretends like he's fishing for other keys in his little pouch and then sneakingly grabbed the keys from the original car that were already on the desk and says \""here you go\""... I get to the lot and all I see is a little Toyota Carolla with a tiny sun roof and a gps from 2003! Mind you I originally rented an Altima or similar, and he gave me a compact!!! Since I was driving my family to San Diego, I decided to call the Mckellips location, told them what happened which they found shocking, and let me switch out the Carolla for a Fully loaded Maxima. They made up for the inconvenience... But I would never trust these hotel locations ESPECIALLY the Scottsdale Resort location. That guy there should be fired without question. Very shady."
"2","Nice to meet the friendly new owners\nGood lentil soup and good coffee\nwe will be back\nAlways want to support a small business owner\nShe is supportive of writers visiting to write\nyahoo\nI will send my women writers friends in Scottsdale Society of Women Writers"
"1","Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars."
"2","This facility is clean, well managed, and well kept.  The shooting range has knowledgable range masters keeping track of people who don't have any idea what they are doing and for those that want some extra time with an instructor... they offer that as well.\n\nTheir store is priced about average for a Scottsdale Gun store but don't expect any killer deals/prices on guns, accessories, or ammo.\n\nI've taken 2 classes at this location that were both great and will continue to renew my membership for many years to come."
"1","You get what you pay for - no-frills basics but it works. The night staff could use some customer service training.  I have no excuse to stay here again and certainly would pursue other options if looking in the area."
"1","If I could give it a zero, I would.  Time was, I would have given it a four star rating mainly because of the courtyard right outside of the suites.  However....  They have recently changed the management team and much of the staff.  The new staff and management are unbelievably rude and nasty,  We used to stay there while in AZ (I mean for 2 to 6 months at a time, yes, that long).  Mainly because they do take dogs and our dogs liked the courtyard area.  This last time, I had numerous run ins with the staff i.e., one morning the guy next to me left his alarm on when he left.   At FIVE A.M.  The front desk refused to go shut it off saying they didn't want to disturb him if he was still there.  I'm like \""if he's still there, he's dead, because the alarm is REALLY loud\"".  They would not call him, knock on his door or anything.  Finally at 7 am I asked housekeeping and they said they'd take care of it.  Nope.  Finally at 8 a.m. I found someone to shut the alarm off.  Another time my dog and I got sick after being in the grass there.  I asked if they spray pesticides or herbicides there.  They assured me they don't.  A week later I see a maintenance guy walking around with a can of herbicides, getting ready to spray.  So I call the manager to complain about being lied to and to ask what the story is.  She would not return my calls.  Not only that, but if you complain about anything, the employees will all gather around you and give you dirty looks to try to intimidate you.  Another time I could not find ANYONe to take my dirty towels and give me clean ones.  So I went into the laundry area and called out.  Nobody.  So I dropped some of my towels off.  THEN a man rushed in and demanded to know what I'm doing in there.  uh, stealing dirty towels?  Yeah, right.  He was really nasty and lectured me.  This place USED to be very customer oriented.  Not anymore.  Considering it isn't \""all that\"" anyway, I'd pass it by and go elsewhere.  Even next door to many of the other customer oriented places.  Also, the clientele is getting more and more questionable.  I had crack addicts stay next to me for a week last time.  And they let their employees live there, so it's like a soap opera with their kids running around unattended and moms and dads fighting and having the police out."
"1","BEWARE OF OUTRAGEOUS PRICES!! First let me say that I have gone to this store for years (before FEDEX it was just a Kinkos).  They have helped me with many projects and although I've NEVER been wowed by their customer service, the finished products were always ok.  But recently I needed some blueprints duplicated in a hurry and instead of running to my normal reprographic place I came here- and can barely explain my shock at the rip off pricing!! I left in a hurry and submitted a complaint on line later that day.  Store manager called and basically said \""oh well\"".  I vow to not go again and spread the word . . Save your hard earned money and use a more customer service oriented place for printing/copy needs!!"
"1","I signed up for 2 separate accounts with the Owner Eric Owen (the owner) It was a combined fee of 5,000 a month.  When I received the first list of Keywords they were terrible. Originally Eric told me that he had personally reviewed them and then after I went over them with him he said that they were \""trash\""  They sent me another list later and again I had to meet with Eric and his team. The case manager could not tell me what words we would prioritize and I again had to cross out many of the words since they had to do with places I didn't do business and for hotels in cities I don't even have a business in.  I was told by Eric that my request was \""Very Reasonable\"" to ask for what keywords would be mapped to which pages of my website. I left for a trip the following few days and when I was able to get internet to review the keywords nothing that Eric promised me was delivered.  I was upset and felt like they had broken the contract for lack of performance.  Eric agreed we were not a good fit... Imagine my surprise when they held 5,000.00 of my money even after they didn't deliver.   During my last meeting with Erica I was promised the Keyword list that he had told me he saw in his office that day... I received an email he needed to find out from his employees what was going on and that I would get the work I had paid for by the next week.... That was the LAST I ever heard of Fasturtle    5K for a terrible keyword list and broken promises...."
"2","Yum yum. Pizzas take a very, long time to come out. I would have given it 5 stars, but the time issue had to be factored in."
"2","This place rocks, best salads, pizza, meatballs are killer! Always friendly people ho work here!"
"2","Pizza is thin and the crust is amazing.  Had the Ziti in the bread bowl.  It's just huge and tough to eat it all.  We love to eat at the bar."
"1","THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THEIR STUFFED PIZZA.\n\nThis pizza is not good.  Someone who works there needs to intern for a few weeks in Chicago and learn the stuffed pizza trade. Too cheesy and my intuition says it is not a blend of cheeses (just mozz) making for a oily one-dimensional pie.  Crust is week, without flavor and cannot hold up to the amount of cheese on the pie.  Sauce is unremarkable.\n\nIf you are used to Chicago stuffed pizza (My Pie, Gino's, Lou's, Burt's etc) you will be VERY disappointed.  I hear that the thin crust is better."
"2","I worked here for a short time three years back and just simply fell I'm love with everything about it. The playing music from the,40s,50s, very much like the Frank Sinatra era. It always reminds me of a back east eatery except they have a wonderful outdoor patio life. They have wonderful flavored salad that are gigantic they could feed probably three hungry girls! They have a very large wine list, and a full bar. You can also place reservation for large parties. I would even recommend that you place a reservations if it's Thursday Friday or Saturday because the wait can be very long if you just show up. They do serve a Chicago style pie pizza, which is to die for! They do slices of pizza if you're trying to eat light or cheap during the lunch hour. And everything is literally made fresh, with very high quality.  The only thing that ever makes me sad here is that the ladies restroom only has one stall..... Other than that there is absolutely nothing to complain about!  the price point is right, the locations are great, the atmosphere is welcoming, and it doesn't matter if it's just you or a party of 30 it is a great choice for dining out as well as pick up!"
"2","You're still in denial.\nThree arrests in the last six months, a family intervention... a failed suicide attempt  and, a short stint in rehab. (hospital, not Hard Rock).\nThere's only one sure way to drop this meth habit for good.\nTaser.\n\nYes, Taser delivers its own unique brand of intervention with over 50,000 volts of reality, and for free no less.\nSimply tussle with a few police officers during one of your meth-fueled domestic violence 'incidents', and before you know it, you'll be laying in a heap swearing off meth forever. \n\nI haven't tried Taser yet, but have several friends on the Phoenix police department who've helped change many lives.\nIn some cases, for good. \n\nTaser totally rocks."
"1","Really bad  customer service.On 1/08/15 me and my wife visited Walmart. Everything was fine until we got to the register where unpleasant& very rude cashier Sandy \""helped\"" us.One of the items in our grocery cart was tangerines that she rang up at 0.58cents a piece (10 pieces total)where the correct price was 0.58cents per pound so after seeing the price for 10pieces of tangerines ($6.80cents)I brought up to her attention that the price was wrong so instead of her calling for a price check she went off on me and said :\""well this is the price that they ring up\"" so I told her again that the price is wrong because it's per pound not per piece& I asked her to check the price herself which she just rolled her eyes and ignored it so at this point I told her that I don't want them anymore (there's a longer story to that but just trying to keep it short)We bought close to $200 in groceries and I wanted to do a multi payment and that's where she got very upset at me and my wife like that option wasn't allowed lol so I told her I want X amount on one card and the rest on the other card and she went off on me AGAIN.Me and my wife got literally shocked and confused as why she is making a problem for us to do a multi payment and was acting all crazy and rude to us and next thing I hear is her trying to call the manager on me lol  (I have to be honest tho- this is very first time ever that employee of a store tried to call the manager on me :D ) I shop at this Walmart for few years now and never had a problem before until today...Time to change Stores I guess because their employees at night shifts have some really nasty attitudes."
"1","great product good price ---HORRIBLE business ethics.  Filing in small claims court this week.  Lets get ready to RUMBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"2","I received a deep tissue massage from Pedro and he did a great job, real firm pressure and seemed to know exactly where to massage. Shortly after I got a facial from Anna, she was very sweet and informative. I have sensitive skin and she used products that worked well with my skin type. It was a great experience! The staff is friendly and the front desk lady was really nice and friendly. I will definitely come back."
"2","Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi."
"1","I have been to Ray's twice. Once for an Eggplant Parmasean Sandwich and once for a Meatball Calzone. The Eggplant Parmasean was Meh and the Meatball Calzone had me saying \""Where's the Beef?\"". The Calzone really didn't have any taste. I will never go back to Ray's."
"1","I don't get it. I ordered a couple of slices of veggie pizza. It was loaded with fresh veggies and I love that, but the overall taste of the pizza was just OK. This pizza must be eaten immediately, the leftover slice 2 hours later made me wanna cry. I only ate half of it and sadly threw it out! I spent way to much money for bad pizza."
"1","Maybe I should have tried the pizza and not a sandwich.....\n\nI usually don't write reviews after one visit but this was so bad, I can't wait.  I looked at their menu online and did see that they offer a cheese sub - awesome (or so I thought).  I go in and order the veggie and cheese sub and watch the gal behind the counter write \""turkey and cheese sub, hold the turkey\"", I'm thinking ok maybe that's how they do it here.  \n\n I unwrap the sandwich when I get home and it looks like it had been run over by a car on the way to my table.  The bread was disgusting - a rubbery and chewy slab of thick white bread that they have the nerve to call a hoagie roll.  The contents were a little lettuce, a little onion, a couple of thin tomato slices and one layer of cheese - processed cheese.  When I think back to how the order was written up I wonder if I did literally get the shell of another sandwich.  I moved the scant one layer of cheese from one side to the other, ate that half and chucked the rest.\n\nThe fact that this sorry excuse for a sandwich came to just under $8 is really just a footnote in comparison to how lousy it was in each and every way.\n\nI probably will go back and try the pizza and will be honest and objective when I do, however, I absolutely would never get a sandwich here ever again."
"2","The lady that helped me was excellent.  We had a bit of a confusing situation with 2 different titles that have changed hands a couple times and she handled it all well.\n\n\""Convenience\"" fees seemed a little high but I guess this is Scottsdale and not Avondale.  \n\nWhen our agent was off handling our paperwork, at least 2 other agents came by to see if we needed help.  This was certainly appreciated as we were in a hurry. Heck, everyone is in the hurry when it comes to DMV stuff.  \n\nI would use them again."
"2","Nadya and her daughter are very friendly and it was a joy taking my bridesmaid dress to her for alterations.  It looked fantastic, like it hadn't even been altered, when I picked it up and it fit so much better!  I'm so glad they are close to my home because I will be taking all my clothes there from now on!"
"2","My coworker recommended Nadya.  I was looking for a place to go that was convenient to stop by on the way home from work. I haven't had anything hemmed in years, so I'm not sure how the prices compare. I had a pant leg hemmed shut where the stitches had come out, and a new zipper added to a pair of jeans, and it was $35.  They did a great job, and when I went back to pick them up she had me cracking up! She was helping another lady while I waited who must go there often, and they were laughing and the lady thanked her a bunch and hugged her goodbye. I think she has a great friendly personality! The only thing I was a little surprised about was prepaying, I wanted to wait to make sure everything looked good first.  They said so many people forget to come back that they have to charge up front. Nonetheless both pants turned out great!"
"1","They should change the name to Streets of Bejing because their pizza, wings, and sandwiches are about as far from New York as anything I've ever experienced!\n\nEven the worst New York pizza is better than what this place is serving up.\nThe wings tasted like they were dipped in vinegar.  No flavor.\nI've eaten at this location several times, each time thinking how maybe I just got a bad dish, or they were off their game that day. Not the case. \n\nGood thing for the owners how most people in Arizona who enjoy S.O.N.Y. have never tasted real New York Pizza and wings, otherwise they'd have been out of business long ago.\nI will never grace their doorstep again, even if they were giving it away!"
"2","I was really in the mood for some wings with my Sam Adams Summer Ale, so I decided to try their hot boneless wings. A full plate of boneless chicken wings came properly sauced, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, with red pepper flakes added to the sauce for heat. Quite good with the side of blue cheese dressing and celery strips.\n\nI also decided to try (of all things) the Tuna Salad sub with Pasta Salad as a side. Wow! I've never had tuna salad with dried cranberry in it, but this was very good, especially with an added slice of provolone. It tasted fresh, with a little crunch from celery and red onion, and just a little bit of mayonnaise. The Pasta Salad side was large, creamy, and delicious...penne pasta with bits of bell pepper, olives, provolone, etc. I was impressed with the sub and side, and will definitely order that combination again.\n\nThe service was attentive, as usual with this location...tea refilled regularly, and frequent table checks. I'll definitely be back."
"2","Love this place. Been bringing my daughter since she was 5 months old. 6 years later, we still come every week! Love the staff!"
"2","Wow this place is fantastic.  My fianc\u00e9 and I are going here for some practice before our wedding.  The staff is amazing.  From the front desk to every instructor.  They all know our name and they are genuinely interested in making our special day truly fun with dance.  They even got me a cake and sang happy birthday when I came in a few days after my birthday!  You will not be disappointed.  Everyone is awesome from Caasandria to Damir to Tudor.  Definitely highly recommend this spot!"
"2","This is a high end fabric care company like no other. I took a very delicate and expensive bed spread to them for care and the final product was flawless."
"1","It is like a parallel bizarre universe, you walk in everything seems familiar but not quite right.\n\nThis is what Sams club is, it is like costco, but just not nearly as good, lower quality products, a odd selection, useless staff and a lack of customers as a result.\n\nThe only highlight of this store is the Hummus, they sell Sabra hummus in large family size containers for a bargain at $6. I did see a recent addition of a house brand and I hope this is not a sign of change.\n\nIf you want a sample you are out of luck too, despite there only being a hand full of other customers, the sample people are painfully slow, and do not create a cache of samples to buffer demand.\n\nI walked around and just felt odd and out of place. Also prices on some items are much higher than other places. A 1.75 of Makers Mark  Bourbon was $35 when it can be had for $27 at Costco.\n\nUnless you have Agoraphobia there is no real reason to shop here."
"1","I didn't have such a great experience. I ordered 5 tires for my vehicle I was given an awesome price when I called the first time, when I called back to make the purchase the price went up over 200 dollars. I asked what happened and the guy couldn't tell me, He said \"" I don't know why its a different price\"" so 20 minutes in he got the price down a little bit. I paid for the tires even though the were now 110 dollars more than the first price, and then he said you should have 3 by tuesday and 2 by wednesday because they are coming from texas. The first call he said they were all in stock, so at this point I was like whatever I can wait til wednesday and then I got my tracking numbers that said I won't see them til friday. So I called first thing in the morning and asked what happened he said UPS changed it and he said he will send the issue to customer service and see if they will send a discount  back to me. I checked my email 10 minutes later he issued me a 25 dollar credit, I called customer service and they were full of excuses and it was very apparent that customer satisfaction isn't as important as they claim it is.. Sounds like Big O tires needs my business next time.."
"2","My parents....both of which are 92.....moved to WMV two years ago. They could not be more pleased."
"1","Mimi's is one of those restaurants that you want to like more.\n\nI say that because the execution is somewhat lacking.  We have been coming here, on and off, for five years now.  It's the coupons in the Sunday paper, or the email club that draw us in.  The pictures of the food look really good. But it's just, okay.  \n\nOne piece of advice for management would be to ease up on the salt.  Neither of us have sodium issues, but we would suspect that after coming here enough we would.  The gravy or sauce on our last visit was so bad, we were scrapping it off the food.\n\nAlso, time moves more slowing at Mimi's.  Maybe it's the lack of exterior windows, but it feels like I'm in a casino buffet room.  It's could also be the somewhat older crowd, who just sits, chats and just drinks coffee.   I do not believe it's the staff's fault, they seem to hustle around the place refilling drinks, etc. But, it would be hard to tell what time of day it is here.\n\nSorry!"
"1","I've been patronizing Mimi's for over 30 years and I am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point, at least at this location.  I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.\n\nOur server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.\n\nAlthough I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live."
"2","A few weeks ago I started a topic about Laser Eye Surgery in the Valley because I had no clue where to start. I got a lot of feedback (Thanks Yelpers!), it was all fantastic, but I chose Bob B.'s recommendation of Jay Schwartz in the end because of credibility. Seeing that he is the team ophthalmologist for the Suns, Diamondbacks and Coyotes - I was immediately sold. I called for an appointment and was immediately scheduled and even mailed a packet of information with pricing and forms to fill out prior to my visit. I was already being educated before walking in the door.\n\nThe consultation for Lasik eligibility was free. And we're not talking a quick in-n-out sales technique. I spent almost 2 hours being informed even further about the procedure and then going through a series of vision tests with not one...not two...but 3 experts (2 Doctors) - the final tests being performed by Dr. Jay Schwartz himself.\n\nI had many questions and each of them were answered clearly, in depth and with genuine care. I was never left alone for longer than a few minutes at which time I was comforted by the signed Marion jersey on the wall. I don't even watch sports, but the entire office has jerseys from our lovely Phoenix sports teams and I'll admit it was pretty reassuring. \n\nI never felt pressured at any time during my visit either. In fact, it was quite the opposite and I had to ask to make an appointment to schedule the procedure. So next week, I will be going in for the surgery and I'll be able to see. It's obvious Dr. Schwartz is an expert and I couldn't feel more confident about my decision. I will post a follow up review in a few weeks to share my experience!"
"1","I had a rock chip in my windshield.About three weeks after it happened, I stopped at Cobblestone to have it repaired so my windshield would not crack. About three times they told me that they \""guarantee their work\"".\nTwo days after the did the repair, my windshield cracked, starting from where they did the 'repair\"". When I went to Cobblestone, and explained the problem, ti turns out that the \""guarantee\"" is that they refund your insurance company the $30 they charged for the repair! Some 'Guarantee\""!\nAdditionally, the manager approached me as I was warning another customer, and thinking he was real cute, told me to get in my car and get my drugs, then 'what have you been smoking?' How professional.\nThis is not an honest establishment, nor do they do good work.\nI would recommend hiring professionals to work on your car, not children."
"1","I wish this was a half star...\nI had a gift card for a detail so I HAD to go here.  Told the guy, no shiny stuff on the dash and don't forget to tell them about the third row...well that didn't happen.  I left my car there for 5 hours only to have to wait an additional 45 minutes to have the car finished - I found all that they forgot.  \n\nCome on people!  I am paying money to have a car detailed!  Do your job!  Don't make me wait when I am there to pick up my car after having it for that long!  \n\nThe kicker was that they \""gave\"" me a free wash for my time...no thank you!  WILL NOT GO BACK!"
"1","I will keep this plain and simple. \nThey washed my car, they damage my rim, they denied all responsibility, I took them to court.\nI won, they lost, and I received a judgement against them for more than $1100.\nThey continued to refuse to pay me even after the judgement was entered,, nor would they still take any responsibility for their actions. \nThey were always through out the entire ordeal condescending, very unprofessional, and rude to deal with. \nI finally had to send the sheriff down to their place of business to take the money owed to me by force by filing a writ of execution in court. Only then did I receive the money owed to me.\n\nThis is the kind of company they are. This is the kind of company you will do business with if you use their services.  \n\nThe moral of this story is simple.\nNEVER EVER, EVER TAKE YOUR CAR TO ANY COBBLESTONE AUTO SPA.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nIn Reply to Cobblestones comment below\n\n\nHow convenient, more than likely I am mixed in there with the many other law suites and judgements against your company, but I can assure you that this case has a very real case number and was adjudicated, and your company lost."
"1","Terrible customer service. High prices. Careless employees inside and out. I won't be back!"
"1","First time visit to Cobblestone in Scottsdale, though I have been to the one off Signal Butte in Mesa (near highway 60).\nIn short, and after spending close to $38 for the Ultimate Plus and leather treatment of my seats, it is easy for me to conclude that I would rather take my BMW 535i to a Full Circle Car Wash or a Francis and Son's car wash for one simple reason:\n1. Much less cost for a more effective wash, dry and detailing.  I spend less then $20 for better work at the other two (2) locations."
"1","This is a warning.  Stay away from these people!  While the workers themselves do their jobs admirably, the managers and company are adept at ripping you off.  \""Sign up for a detailing and you get two free car washes.\"" Except that one of those \""free\"" car washes is used up by the detailing!  And heaven help you if you want a refund!  two months later we're still trying despite having filled out all the paperwork - twice!  Consider yourself warned!"
"1","I bought a groupon to try this place out.  I'm not impressed with the wait as I was told half hour and it's been over an hour.  And there were upcharges.  Surprise.....so my 35 dollar oil change and car wash turned into an extra 32 dollars.  Won't be back.  The help was nice but still not returning."
"1","I am extremely disappointed! I was surprised at how fast they were done and after doing a quick walk around my car I pointed out numerous areas missed. It was as if he never wiped down the outside! It was so ridiculous and I was so aggravated that I said \""Whatever, forget it\"" then tipped the bare minimum and left. I will not go back."
"2","I usually don't like the old Marriott Suites. I just never did like the room layouts which is probably one of the reasons that they never took off. They are not set up for working. You usually can't sit at the desk and work while you watch TV. This one is a little different in that it is more of a vacation hotel then a business hotel. It is on one of the two TPC Scottsdale golf courses (not the one that has the Waste Management Tournament). It has a nice pool area, a great patio for dinning. Like all of the old Marriott Suites, it does not have a concierge lounge, but as a Platinum they provide free breakfast. Breakfast was good to very good."
"1","At first glance, this is a great community. The dog parks and pools are the best part of this place. And thats where the greatness ends.\n\nTHE STAFF IS HORRIBLE!!!!! They do not return phone calls, and basically have their heads up their butts, because there is no communication between the corporate office and all their residences...\n\nI heard good things about Mark Taylor Residences,which is why we looked at this place, but after living with them for over a year, \nI WILL NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND LIVING HERE. \nThey overcharge for rent, and dont tell you when your rent is being raised. They also require a 60 day to-vacate notice, not a 30 day, and they dont tell you that either. READ THE FINE PRINT. Otherwise, you will get screwed. Oh, and make sure that you look at an apartment that you would actually be getting, because they show you the better one of the two. We got all old appliances and old carpet, but they showed us a nicer place, saying it was the same rent. When we went to move in, they said \""oh you have to pay more for that one you looked at.\"" Freaking idiots. Come to find out, our neighbor paid the same rent and had all those new things that we were excited about in the beginning. When we brought it up to a manager, we didn't receive a call back. Figures...\n\nEven after moving out, we are still getting screwed. We had our address changed with the office, and even after going to the office a second time to make sure it was changed, they still didn't do it. My fiance's mail for the last month and a half has been being sent back to the post office, bills included. \n\nSO THANK YOU VERY LITTLE MARK TAYLOR RESIDENCES, FOR SCREWING OVER YOUR RESIDENTS! \n\nDO NOT MOVE IN HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","This place can eat my ass!! I went to the deli to get a sandwhich. \n\nSo I asked the clerk if they used any partially hydrogenated oils.\n\nShe had to call her corporate office.\n\nThey called her back to tell her the verdict...........................\n\n(..........................= drumroll)\n\nBingo!  The harmfull oil is in there wheat bread and the white bread!!!\n\nAMAZING!! I could never support a supposed health food store that uses an oil like that. \n\nIf you dont know how bad it is. peep this out\n\nbantransfat.com"
"2","We have found Sprouts to be one of the best green grocers in the area, though at times, as others have mentioned the prices can be on the high sign.  \n\nThat said, this is a good location although you sometimes need to fight the traffic from neighboring Chompie's and Starbucks.  The produce is always fresh and you can get those hard to find items for those more unusually recipes here.    I also like their cheese selection and sometimes make a trip just for that.\n\nThe staff has always been very helpful and we enjoy shopping here.  But this is not our weekly grocery, since we too are mindful of the prices that are not on special that week."
"1","Very disappointed with amount they assigned to goods was so shocked I literally did not refuse payment but went back to make sure they had given full credit ,still don't believe they did check all items. Will never consign there again."
"1","This is one of the worst time share places  I have ever  stayed at.    It needs better regular maintenance and some updating might help i.e. spend money on bathroom, some new TV's and paint.  If you dont want to hang out there you are in trouble because nothing of note is within walking distance."
"1","I decided to go to the \""holiday skate\"" public session at noon. I'm a figure skater and wanted to have some fun on the ice, no tricks, just something to loosen my muscles and have a good time. I expected plenty of kids and families, but nothing I can't navigate around. \n\nI arrived early to catch the good ice, however it was already complete snow. Did a couple rounds, but became irritated and a little frightened at the absolute madness. \n\nNo staff was on the ice to keep at least some order to things. I figured during your busiest hour there's literally not one staff member to keep unsupervised children going in the right direction? Many loose items were on the rink,such as girls holding their purses while attempting to skate. Entire large families were holding hands on the rink, completely blocking the way...only to stop and take photos right in the middle of the ice. Groups of people were standing around oblivious to their surroundings, chatting and blocking the path.\n\nSkating here as a more advanced but considerate, SAFETY FIRST skater was impossible. Kids were falling all around me, and luckily I know how to navigate and stop before running them over (note that there was probably only 5 other skaters on the ice who knew how to skate so this is scary). Rentals were extremely dilapidated, and when I brought back a defective skate I was told in a condescending manner that I wasn't \""lacing them right.\"" Kind of scary for the next person to come along.\n\nI find their holiday/public skate to be *extremely dangerous*. Do not take your kids here, especially if they are weaker skaters or just learning. Save the medical bills and take them to AZ Ice in Peoria or Arcadia Ice, both much safer and fun environments for the little ones (and adults!)"
"2","One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.\n\nThe sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!  I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.  Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!"
"2","Fancy this is not.  It's more like a teleport to one of the restaurants you find a few blocks south of the border for lunch when on a shopping trip in Mexico.  I've been to Los Olivos several times over the last few years and it's decent, typical southern AZ mexican fare.  Get something fried.  Don't be in a hurry.  Bring a friend and enjoy their company while you munch and drink.  Los Olivios doesn't pretend to be something it's not - it's just serving everyday Arizona style Mexican food without fooling around."
"1","Service was decent, even though it was busy for lunch both times.  Food came out quickly, once ordered.\n\nFor the quality level of the food the cost was a bit high.  I believe the lunch specials were around $10.  The Salsa was decent, but the cooked food was greasy.   They do offer the option of black beans instead of refried, which is nice.  There are large portions, but quality of ingredients isn't there, and food is somewhat bland, requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor."
"1","Atmosphere =F\nWait Staff and Greeter Girl=D\nBus boy/chip boy=A+\n\nI went to dinner with  my kids tonight and the girl who sat us couldn't even smile just a little...she almost seemed annoyed that we walked in the front door.  We were seated and weren't acknowledged for a good 6 o 7 minutes.  The bus boy saw this and immediately brought chips...still no waiter.  After my son tried the hot salsa he was gasping and turning red dying for some water that the bus boy came over and took our drink order and gave us a menu\nThe waiter came over 2 seconds after that and asked if we were ready to order...we only had the menu for 2 to 3 seconds so no we weren't ready to order.  He said he come back....we waited for him to come back for over 10 minutes.  By the way, there was only 5 other tables being sat at...the restaurant was empty.  Our waiter NEVER smiled...seemed grumpy that he was working.  \n\nDid I tell you the bus boy/chip boy was great!!!  If it wasn't for him I would have left 1 star!  The food was just OK.  My sons got chicken tenders and fries and it tasted like the fryer hadn't been cleaned in weeks...UGH...soggy flat fries and the tenders turned a dark brown color from dirty fryer oil.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be coming back.  Hope the owner looks at these reviews and does something positive....the restaurant needs some spunk/life to it.  Just very drab and plain like the wait staff!"
"1","Sadly, in the past couple of months, this place has declined. Service is non-existent.  I have been sitting here in the bar for 10inutes after sitting in the dining room for 15 minutes with zero acknowledgement.  The youngish girl with long dark red hair and bangs is rude and inept. I am only sitti g here to write this, then leaving. Sad. It was my favorite."
"2","Go figure that I would spot this place even before I got to the coffee shop that I was looking for.  After my coffee splurge I decided to come in here for a look-see.  My attention was first caught by the 20% off handbags, and I did look at a few business totes that a sales associate was most helpful with.  This surprised me because I had the impression that the staff at the store might be the snooty, but she wasn't.  They have quite a variety of brands here that include Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture amongst others, which I believe DSW does not carry.  The sales aren't as great.  I did get 30% off a pair of Charles David shoes here, and many of the shoes don't come with shoe boxes.  The cashier was nice enough to give me a nice Cole Haan shoe bag perfect for packing in my luggage.  I was enticed by these Juicy Couture boots here, but I walked away..."
"1","This place is ok, but not really what I expected from N. Scottsdale. The prices are appropriate for designer shoes in N. Scottsdale, but I didn't find the selection to be all that appealing. \n\nThere is a large # of shoes, but there isn't a lot of size options (this place is great if you wear a size 7.) I was getting really agitated and looking at shoes with a gigantic fake flower on the top (heels, boots, sandals- you name it and it had a fake flower on it.) \n\nNot really impressed here. There were a couple of adorable shoes that I would have snatched up at $65 (reg. over $100) but they didn't have it in my size (8 1/2.) \n\nProbably wont be going back. The discount isn't worth looking at so many ugly shoes only to be disappointed that the cute ones aren't in my size. I'll stick with full price- there isn't much of a difference anyways."
"1","Beware of misleading prices. At the register, you will learn that you will pay much more than the price posted. You have to go online to obtain a rebate. Really?? Hello Best Buy or Target, both down the street."
"2","We have shopped and bought tires at various Discount Tires over the years, including this one.  The service is great and they are more than willing to work with you in finding the right tire for your car. \n\nRecently, we needed two Michelin MXV4s for one of our cars. We shopped online at DiscountTire.com and found the tires we wanted.  Priced it out, paid, reserved the tires for this location and just came in to have them mounted & balanced.  Nice!  In the end, it saved us $65 over their previous quote. Also, nice!"
"1","This place is all about the 'upsell'.  Once they get you in the door with their low memberships they start pumping their 'supplements' and personal training, which is their main revenue stream.  You have to be very assertive with them and tell them to back off, otherwise they will just keep coming after you to get you to buy their products and services.  This is the most aggressive gym I have ever been to in terms of their constant and relentless upsell efforts.  It can be a real turn off."
"2","Had my last 5 or 6 haircuts here, usually the same gal, and they do an excellent job here, and its cheap! Clean, friendly, get what you paid for kind of deal. No surprises! Much better than Great Clips!"
"1","I am giving 4.5 stars to the service but just 1 star for the beverage. Here's the story.\n\nI was thrilled to see a jamba juice in the shopping center I was in. I love jamba juice and have my go to: razzmataz that I always request.\n\nThis time I came in and as always, ordered a razzmattaz. \n\nI got it and went back in the car. I took a sip and realized it just tasted off. It simply wasn't sweet enough and seemed to be lacking an ingredient. I was going to just suck it up and drink it anyway but I was with my mother and as she said \""you should get what you pay for and this wasn't cheap\"" so she went in and nicely told them that it just didn't taste right.\n\nThey very graciously offered to quickly make a new one and even upgraded us to a much larger size. I thought this was great customer service!\n\nSadly, the drink still tasted like it was lacking the sweetness.\n\nI am not sure if their recipe was off or what but I was left disappointed in the taste."
"1","Rude front desk clerk, Jack. Sounded annoyed when I called to complain about the room next door and their howling dog for the 2nd night in a row. Lame breakfast bar and the advertisement for a kitchen in the room is actually a tiny little door that has a mini microwave and mini refrigerator. No stove. Wouldn't stay here again even for free."
"1","Went to Bicycle Ranch some years back for a bike fit with Paric (not sure how to spell his name). Never did get fit. He took several measurements, but was never really paying attention as he was busy talking with my wife the entire time. In the end, he moved my cleats back a few millimeters and told me that I need physical therapy to loosen my hips. He did nothing to address my issues with discomfort on the bike. So much for getting what you pay for. Pick another shop if you expect to have a professional fit. I won't even step into that bike shop anymore."
"2","Vets can be a touchy subject.\n\nOver the weekend, we were having dinner at a friend's house, who has nearly a dozen rescued animals.  She and her husband are quiet sane, but generous to a fault.  If, that is a fault.  I noticed they had three of the four James Herriot's  \""All Creatures Great and Small\"" novels on the book case.  It got us to talking about our wee beasties and the doctors who care for them.\n\nOne of the ongoing themes in the novels is Vet Siegfried Farnon's rants about the cheapness of the folks who live in the Yorkshire Dales.  Well, not a lot has changed for Vets or animal owners I guess.  \n\nWe are always looking for the most competent, least expensive way to care for our pets.  And, when we find a good one, for the most part you want to keep it a secret.  Some can be prone to expensive tests or procedures, while others can balance common sense and reasonable care given the pet's age, et cetera.\n\nWe have tried other Veterinaries and animal hospitals in the valley, but we keep coming back for that fine balance and love that Horizon and it's staff shows to our wee beasties!"
"1","This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels."
"1","Worst staff ever!  As I was waiting in line to order, Colin was openly mocking women and making fun of another overweight customer in the presence of patrons!  Will never come back to this location and strongly suggest you take your business elsewhere!"
"1","Worst Chipotle I've ever been to. They skimp on everything to the point you think it's a joke. We kept going back thinking it was just a fluke, continues to happen. Also whether there's a line or not, the service is really slow. \n\nThey literally sprinkle everything, to the point they make a normal scoop and then pour most of it back. \n\nWill be going to the 92nd/Shea location from now on."
"1","Never really had a problem with this chipotle But had a terrible experience today. Employees were super rude from start to finish. Awful customer service. The lady at the end started rolling my burrito before I was even finished ordering. Never asked if I wanted anything else. Brought it home and right as I began to eat I noticed a decent sized black line on my tortilla - sharpie. Avoided the entire middle of my burrito. Sharpie isn't toxic but it's still not good to ingest. Disappointing because this chipotle is very close to my house. But it isn't much farther to go to 90th and Shea. I will not be returning to this location."
"1","I've been meaning to review Red Robbin, I mean Red Robin for awhile. My wife and I went in here late one night after waiting about 10 minutes at our table at Mimi's for a waiter. Unfortunately we went over to Red Robin for a very poor tasting $19 per person Burger, drink and fry combo. They have unlimited fries, who cares, the burgers suck."
"1","While the staff is pretty friendly here, there is NO need to have a drive thru (with at least 15 cars blocking the parking lot) in a state that has 120 degree heat.  I'm pretty sure Arizona & Starbucks are doing their share to contribute to global warming."
"1","They destroy my drink 8/10 times and their baristas are quite rude. For one of the busiest Starbucks in Scottsdale, they lack quite a bit. I stopped coming to this Starbucks. I now go to the other one inside the store off the freeway."
"1","I went to this place because I bought a Groupon for 30 Dysport units (just enough to treat the frown lines between my brows.). I arrived 15 minutes early for my 5:00 appointment. I FINALLY got in for my FIVE MINUTE PROCEDURE at 6:05 - and then waited longer for the doctor to appear - making us late for my husband's physical therapy appointment. The receptionist - after the third time I asked how much longer it would be - finally deigned to tell me \""Oh, we're running about 15 minutes behind\"". Meanwhile 5 people went in ahead of me. After getting into the room, I noticed things looked a just little shabby, and there was an (open!) syringe on the counter. I should have insisted that I be allowed to watch the draw of the product - but, foolish me, I trusted all was as it should be. When the doctor finally appeared she was pleasant enough, though she tried very hard to talk me into an additional Dysport injection in my forehead I declined. Now, 2 days later, I have yet to see ANY results, which leads me to suspect either the Dysport wasn't applied properly or perhaps I didn't get the full dosage. I've used this product several times in the past and usually only require 20 units of Dysport (and about 10 of Botox) to treat those minimal lines. All in all, a frustrating spend of our limited time. I won't return."
"1","I'm shocked to see so many positive reviews.  Bread is subpar, staff at the location is rude, or at least they were to us.  Definately will not return to this store, nor purchase any of their products (which are sold under many different names)."
"2","I'm writing this on behalf of my wife and myself.  In addition to my wife's regular checkups for about a decade,  Dr. Grade was the doctor for all three of our children.  We've always felt in the best hands with her and we'd highly recommend her as a doctor."
"1","This dry cleaner recently took over from the previous owners that I decided to stop going to because they didn't accommodate alterations on site. My daughter wanted a neighborhood cleaner to bring her Sanctuary Elements uniform to...a Diane Von Furstenberg dress that she has to have cleaned weekly. She asked me to drop off her dress so I decided to add a White House/Black Market cotton/viscose sweater to be cleaned. White House is my go-to store for all my work clothes.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the dress and sweater, my sweater was BEIGE!!! The young girl behind the counter saw my face and said \""Is their something wrong?\"" I said \""Yes, my white sweater looks like its been ruined. It was white.\"" She said \""I'm sorry, we've had trouble with the guy in the back.  I will put it back through to be cleaned again.\""  I relented.\n\nA week later I went to pick it up. Now, let me tell you. A cotton and viscose sweater has a shiny thread appearance to it. It is has a lusterous rather than matte fabric.  My sweater looked beat-up, dingy, grayed, frayed and lacked the original luster it held. Obviously, the cleaners damaged it the first time and in order to get the discoloration or polluted smog out of it they had to bleach it. The sweater recommends you use non-chlorine bleach. It has the option to hand wash or dry clean. The owner Martin happened to be the one I was greeted by upon pick up. I very calmly spoke to him and told him I was not happy. I said, \""My sweater is ruined. It's lost its white color and is quite frayed. It's not shiny anymore.\"" He said, \""I am sorry and paused.\"" I said, \""I would like it replaced.\"" He said, \""You will have to find your receipt. Bring a copy of your receipt and I will reimburse you.\"" I agreed and he asked to retain the sweater.\n\nThis sweater wasn't horribly expensive. It was $88 but i got it on sale for $66.88. I keep all my receipts and found it. I returned one week later and left off a copy of the receipt with a new clerk.  I was told I would get a call when my check was ready to be picked up.\n\nI didn't get a call back. This was a busy time for me so i finally got over there on Christmas Eve to pick up my reimbursement check. Martin was there. He said \""I am not going to reimburse you. I took your sweater to the White House/Black Market store and spoke to two sales people and the manager. I compared your sweater to another similar sweater and everyone agreed it was just like new.\"" I was flabbergasted.  I said, \""You're kidding right? You went to the store?  I'm embarrassed for you. You can't tell it has been ruined? Your clerk said that you had trouble with another work who turned it beige.\""  He said something like ... the sweater was cleaned properly and I have been reassured by the store it is in its original condition.  I don't remember what he said after that.  I can't believe a store would not stand by its customer's disapproval of their services and not make amends.  \n\nYou guys!  My sweater is un-wearable! It's off to Goodwill. I am not the kind of person to get mad at vendors. I don't complain and if you ask anyone I am usually overly agreeable and provoke a group consensus. \n\nI also am going to write customer service at White House. I find them to be a reputable company that stands behind their products. I think Martin wanted to be right instead of satisfying a customer. All over $66.88. Ridiculous!  I would not recommend this company. My daughter has told the Sanctuary to not use this dry cleaner either for their uniforms. \n\nThey have two locations. Please don't go to either one of them. at 3375 E. Shea Blvd. or 9301 E. Shea Blvd."
"2","The restaurant is hidden away in the corner of a busy strip mall near Chompie's.  Happy hour is Sun-Thu 5pm-6pm, when all sushi (non-market priced nigiris not makis) on the menu are 50% off.  Most items are $4-$5.  The highest price item is amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) $7, which was huge and very fresh.  The head is served deepfried which is better than any french fry.  I also like the oysters with ponzu sauce."
"2","Can't say enough good things about Sushi Ko. A regular group from work and I go at least once a week and sometimes as much as 3 times a week for lunch. The specials are great and the quality of the food is always excellent. \n\nIf you are looking for a glam-type of sushi bar that serves dozens of western rolls then go to Ra.... but if you want tasty, reasonably priced AUTHENTIC sushi then Sushi Ko is the place!"
"2","I am a big fan of chipotle.  Kind of embarrassed to say it but I have gotten Chipotle about once a week for the past 4 years.  I usually go pick it up during lunch at work, and this location is the one I always go to.  This location might be busy, but the workers there are AWESOME.  From the line cooks to the manager, they are all very friendly and accommodating.   The best part is how efficient they are at making your burrito.  Other chipotles' in the Phoenix area take note!  Suggestion to avoid the lines:  Get there around 12:30 instead of around noon."
"1","Came in dressed for work, though admittedly with my wheeled cart because I was on my way to Walmart. This was apparently sufficient to get me the \""delay until the customer leaves\"" treatment.\n\nYou're a crappy burger joint near a Walmart. You have no justification for this level of snobbery."
"1","The usually good food was disappointing. Two Specials (Entrees) bombed.\nTrio Ravioli was over laden with dough.  and the Linguini with clam sauce was tasteless.\nStick with sandwiches and pizza."
"1","Beware the lunch  \""special\"" of a slice of cheese pizza for $3.  I ordered two slices and a medium drink for take out..  My bill was $9.15!!  What the...?!  Seriously??\n\nFor that price, I was anticipating a couple of nice-size slices of pizza but each was maybe the size of my hand and that includes the 1\"" crust on the end!!  \n\nI'll admit the pizza tasted good, but the disastrous value made it hard to enjoy.  Lesson learned.  If I return, it will be with a coupon in hand."
"2","Was looking for a place that delivers Pizza and found this joint on Yelp.  I ordered a small Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza w/Jalapenos on 1/2 ($10.95 plus $1.75 for each topping).\n\nThe Pizza was delivered pretty quickly.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=YteH1pH5LJEpwG07ZX3N9A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=HlzLd9Q8thIf0PZ33AgRuw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wEc4JE2NYQr1RnGjGr4q7w?select=-8ecQVJPSRa3WlsKLsTbIQ\n\nI took one bite out of a slice and instantly became a fan!  The Sausage had a nice balance of flavors...slightly sweet, but very good.  The Jalapenos are on the spicy side, which is how I like it.....for some people, it may be too much.\n\nOverall, it was a solid Pizza.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
"1","For the record: I'm just not that into salmonella. \n\nWe hit this place on a Wed after work for some snacks and a beer. We needed a fun place to go to fairly quickly because we have a little one that hits the sack early. \n\nIt was still happy hour -it goes until 7, so that goes in the plus column, so we ordered quesadillas ($4 on hh menu) and a cobb salad to share. The quesadillas were really only worth about $4- two of the pieces had nothing but cheese in them. The two pieces in the middle had some tomatoes, green onions and black beans. Definitely not worth the more than $4 they normally are. \n\nThen, our salad showed up with chicken that was completely raw in the middle. All the way through every slice- RAW, PINK, JELLY. We sent it back and the server was pretty apologetic. \n\nWhen it arrived, the manager brought it and literally all he was was, \""Sorry,\"" and dropped it off at the table. Maybe I'm a snob, but if I had almost made an entire family  seriously ill, I would have offered to pay for the salad. \n\nWe will probably skip this place and just hit Four Peaks from here on out."
"2","Went here last night with coworkers.  Great happy hour prices.  Nice atmosphere.  Definitely a chill casual sports bar feel. Just got bar food but it was good.  Looking forward to going back for poker or trivia."
"2","K'Os is a great place to go for happy hour. They have awesome specials and the drink prices aren't bad at all. I've been here multiple times, and I have never had bad service. The patio is a dog friendly patio, which is nice. We go there for the sports games because there are 6 different tv's outside playing the different games, and you can get a little sound box for your table that will play the audio for the game you want to watch, which I thought was super cool. If you're looking to have some fun and watch a game and have some drinks, I would suggest you try K'Os."
"2","Had a service issue but owner handled very professionally.  The food is very good, and have eaten there many times!  Being able to smoke cigars on back patio is a great add!"
"2","Great sports bar and grill. We called ahead for seating for 20 after a ballgame. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good. The nachos are huge! The Irish Stew is comfort food! The outside patio had our group set up in two big tables. It was a nice place to celebrate our winning game and enjoy fellowship with the team."
"1","Misdiagnosed the problem. Didn't even seem to want to fix it. Dukes was much more professional, fixed the correct problem and even gave better pricing for the blower motor, which wasn't even broken.\n\nThe worst part is that I know the ac guys tech most likely had a generic relay in his van. And even if he didn't, I'm sure hq has them in stock. We went three days without ac because of the holiday, waiting for a shop to buy a motor from."
"2","We had the pleasure of working with Bradys Florals for our destination wedding at the Sanctuary Camelback Resort and Spa. \n\nDuring our initial conversation with Lorraine I asked her to show me something I have never seen before. And boy did she deliver! She produced some of the most spectacular arrangements I have ever seen. Not only does she have impeccable taste but she was a joy to work with.  In fact, we trusted her so much that we ultimately gave her complete creative freedom for the event. \n\nThe difference between a regular florist and a DESIGNER, is that Lorraine was able to bring our wedding space to life by creating elegant, balanced designs combined with unique colors and textures. \n\nI was overwhelmed with guests praising how magnificent the flower arrangements were. My cascading bouquet of QueenAnne's lace, ranunculus and orchids smelled incredible. But my personal favorite was her chuppah design of smilax which accentuated the incredible garden view of the mountains.\n\nEvery detail was considered. Every petal was inspected.  It was simply... breathtaking. Thank you again to Lorraine and the entire crew at Brady's and the Sanctuary who made our wedding simply unforgettable."
"1","House Margs are good cheap and big.  Just how I like my men."
"1","Came here for lunch because my lunch date wanted Mexican and it was by both our offices.  They had a $4.99 special of a chicken enchilada with a side of beans and rice.  What a smokin' deal, right?  Unfortunately, the enchilada was horrible.  It was tasteless, old and completely falling apart.  I picked at it and ended up with about 4 bites.  The chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal.  I definitely got what I paid for. Never again."
"1","Absolutely atrocious service, while there were only three tables of customers at 7pm on a Saturday night.  To top it off, the waiter was a smart ass when, after 15 minutes of his being MIA, we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks & food.  On the plus side, the food was fine and arrived quickly (even before the chips and salsa appetizer?)."
"2","The White Sands Chimi is my regular favorite.  Best salsa in town but ask for the hot salsa which is my number one favorite.  Margaritas are great and HUGE.  Food is more New Mexican than Mexican.  It's spicy but excellent.  Ask for Raul.  He made us laugh and gave us great service.  Our favorite Mexican in Scottsdale."
"2","Arribas is great! The chips are fresh and both salas and the bean dip are delicious. I had the white sands chimichanga - it was so good!"
"2","Just returned from a \""skin care bootcamp.\"". The staff at Van Dyke are all warm, welcoming, and quite knowledgeable about their products (including the non-clinical staff).  Dr.  Van Dyke was informative, down to earth and funny during her lecture.  Looking forward to learning more about them and their services."
"2","Surprised to see such bad reviews here, so I am going to overcompensate with a 5-star so they can work to even this deal out...\n\nIt is not a 5-star place, no doubt, but for where it is, what it is, and the price it is, damn good deal and a nice track...\n\nIt's harder than one would think to play golf in Scottsdale if you are a reasonably good golfer and want a good course, but can't afford a $200 dollar round. I don't like the super cheap courses because its more pain than it is pleasure.\n\nStarfire offers that middle ground for me, a mid-range golf course, that by no means is it BEAUTIFUL or BREATHTAKING, but what it is, a good track for a good price... There are a couple of really great holes too...\n\nYou'll find me out here at least 1x a month"
"1","Wow...and I don't mean that in a good way! It's hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad, but here we go: My first review that is really bad. I visited this Chili's today because I had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home. I previously heard that they had a menu of 550 calorie meals. I'm not really a calorie counter, but I'm definitely health conscious and I looked at what the offerings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals. They seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed, unrefined ingredients. \n\nWell, I arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter. Okay...that's fine. I just waited a little. It gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before I go any further. I didn't like the environment. It was really dark; a lot of that of course had to do with the cloudy weather we had today. This was lunch time though and I wasn't looking for any mood lighting. The next thing I didn't like was that it felt like a bar. Now I know this wasn't a fancy restaurant, but I didn't come here to be at a bar! So minutes passed and I was getting incredibly impatient because there was still no greeter to offer me a seat. Was I free to sit anywhere I want? Defintely, NO! I was about to leave, but my companion didn't want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server. I was facing the door at this point and someone near the bar area asked if someone was helping us. Of course, NO! We were seated. I agreed with the first seat we were offered, but after sitting there for a few seconds I realized it was just too dark. I asked if it was okay to sit by the window and was allowed to sit elsewhere. \n\nAlas, I sat down again and looked through the menu. Where is the 550 calorie meals? I don't see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table. I looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that I could replace that whole idea with and the answer was NO! I wonder if the 550 calorie meals were only offered for dinner. I don't know. I didn't bother to ask either so I just walked out.\n\nI assume this Chili's isn't always a bad deal and bad expierience, but I have to rate this visit according to my experience. ONE STAR!!! Hey, Chili's at Shea, it hurts me as much as it hurts you."
"1","I should have checked on here before visiting this place. If I could give them no stars I would too.\n\nI am sorry to say that this was by far the worst experience I have had dealing with anyone. I have dealt with some horrible used car salesmen before and this appliance place puts them all to shame. They have no common sense what so ever. They delivered a defective refrigerator and had the audacity to want to charge us 25% restocking fee when we requested to exchange it. I am appalled at their business practices and can not fathom how could someone let $35k worth of a sales fall through because they do not want to work with the customer and resolve some issues that in my opinion could have easily been rectified. Thanks to them we ended up going to Spencers and saved an additional $1200 because they were running a special when you buy a refrigerator, stove-top, and oven."
"1","I'm joining the list of bad reviews to this place.\nI came here looking for the whole thing... New kitchen and I was going all out.   He assured me that this place was the place to be \""no worries I'll take care of you\"". I had looked online so I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to spend, after telling him what I wanted he told me that he would get back to me with a price... I figured that he was going to try to give me a good price and that he needed to get approval for it.. The next day he called me and said \"" I have good news, I got you the contractors price but you have to pay for it up from\"". I was pretty exited and told him great!!!! How much? $24750.00 - at that point I thought that maybe there was a mistake on what the whole order had been.. I had priced all the items for $21000.00 online..\nThe next day, I stopped by to see what the discrepancy was.. Well the only thing wrong was the fact that he wanted to make an extra $250 per item on top of what the listed price was... I asked him to let me see the book were I got the prices from and he reduced... Then I told him that I had looked online and he was way off. He responded with \""all of the appliances sold online are defective or old models..  \nI must had a sign on my forehead that said idiot that day.. I simply walked  way.. \nI drove to a place on Tatum and bell, walked in and told the guy what I needed. He got me a quote of $20000.00 - I offered him $18000 he said yes and 3 weeks latter I was ready to remodel the kitchen..."
"1","If ur not a middle aged or older women from scottsdale and loaded don't plan on getting any help. There's some great furniture and the name says it all Fiesta."
"2","If you're looking for fresh, healthy, quick and tasty, The Blue Burrito is a sure bet. We recently tried the Shea/Scottsdale Rd. location (NE corner), which has a very attractive bar. The whole restaurant has a modern, comfortable, welcoming feel, but the long bar really caught our attention. It's the perfect place to come after work to enjoy a drink, some socializing, not spend a lot or wait long for your food.  We originally ordered only iced teas until we saw how reasonably priced the margaritas were, which were delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe staff was friendly, patient, helpful and exuded the feeling that they liked working there. I even chatted a bit with Memo the cook, whose open kitchen was clean and orderly.\n\nAs for the food, it's very satisfying and will cause next-day cravings! My husband orders the shrimp burrito, which is really big! I must have the machaca beef tacos and our little one likes the cheese quesadillas. The rice and beans are good sides, but the free chips,  pico de gallo and the available salsas are positively addictive! \n\nThis location is now our favorite Blue Burrito :)"
"1","Cute place for kids but overly priced. $20 for my 5 year old boy to get a buzz cut. Not worth it to sit in a taxi."
"1","Go to The Yard House.... For Beer and Food....\n\nYes - The Yard House is chain but their food is 100000x.  The menu actually sounds more appealing and the food actually is better..\n\nI was looking forward to going to 4 Peaks after hearing great things.  I certainly enjoy a nice cold beer.  (Which they don't have at 4 Peaks - b/c apparently room temperature and slightly colder are the perfect temps to bring out the flavor?!?!  - if thats the case - then why was the frosty mug created?)\n\nOur water was great - straight up honest about what he likes and didn't in regard to the menu - which I really appreciate.\n\nOverall - unimpressed...."
"2","A great Brewpub!!  It is about half way between two of my favorite golf stores, so thankfully it  is very convenient for me.  They also have two of my favorite beers - Kilt Lifter and Oatmeal Stout. Consequently, I am here on a regular basis.\n\nI have stopped by at all times of the day - lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  I have to confess, I very seldom eat here - not because the food is bad - but simply because I am usually on my way one place or another.  What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.\n\nWhat stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.  \n\nAlthough it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve. \n\nBe aware - it can get busy, particularly at night and during popular games. If you don't like crowds, or just want quiet conversation and drinking, it can be overwhelming."
"1","I have been to this place a couple of times for business lunches and had never been disappointed with food or service until tonight.\n\nFood 2/5\n\nWe had the thai hummus and southwest burger. The hummus is actually very nice. Has a nice kick to it and you take taste the peanut sauce but its not overwhelming. The pita however was very soggy and felt like it came straight out of a microwave. The southwest burger was good, nothing more and nothing less. I did expect more 'southwest flavor' though.\n\nService 1/5\n\nAbout 2 minutes after our appetizer was brought out the server brought our entree's  'Sorry, your server put in two different tickets' was his reaction when he noticed that we had just begun eating the appetizer. When we asked our waitress she said 'its so quiet tonight that they're just really fast bringing out the food.'  \n\nWhen I notified the waitress that the fries were luke warm and that I was not happy with the whole situation she looked at us with a 'wow, I really dont care. wtf are you complaining about' attitude and asked us what we would like her to do. \nI guess it was too much to ask of her to just fix the situation. We ended up eating our appetizer as dessert -after- our entree since the entree itself wasnt warm to begin with and didnt want it to cool any further while we ate our appetizers. Then, when we *after* were finished another server brought new fries -which we did not ask for and sent back to the kitchen- ???\n\nTo top it off, our server must have noticed that we already had dessert in the form of appetizers and dropped the check at our table without asking whether we wanted dessert. And yes, you've guessed it, everything was on there we paid full price for very poor service and mediocre food.\n\nThe beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley."
"2","We called to make Friday night reservations for a party of 16 - they said they didn't take reservations so we decided to go anyway and drink beer until we could get seated.  To our most pleasant surprise, they pulled together some tables upstairs and we were seated right away.  Our waitperson was very patient and helpful as we all tried to decide what to eat and what beer to drink.  Service was excellent!  Food was excellent!  The beer was excellent as well - thanks Four Peaks for a wonderful evening."
"1","Big City Bagels is somewhere between a bagel cafe and Einstein.  They don't have all the trappings of a cafe (no egg salad, none of that)  but they do have nice normal bagel flavors and the bagels were slightly better than Einstein.  \n\nThey have a huge Snapple fridge which excited me, but alas, no regular Snapple.  Why is everything diet here?  I don't get it."
"2","I'm rarely in Scottsdale, but I had meetings all day.  I asked a coworker where to go for lunch and he made the suggestion we hit up Big City Bagels.  I'm so glad we did.  \n\nI had a BLT Bagel to fulfill my bacon craving.  The bacon was crispy and there was plenty of it.  The sandwich was great, filling without being heavy.  The veggies were fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly and I was quite impressed.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back to Scottsdale for another lunch!"
"2","My mom and I stopped here for a quick lunch one day and enjoyed the food! We each got a sandwich and each were fresh and tasty! Staff was friendly and welcoming too! My only suggestion for them is to have some sweet stuff out where we can see them because if I saw something sweet (and I know you have sweet stuff for sale) then I would have probably bought something sweet :) Oh and when the weather is nice this would be a great place to chill outside (they have a patio out front)."
"2","Really friendly folks serving up good breakfast grub and great coffee."
"2","In my constant quest to find good bagels in AZ I came across Big City and figured I'd give them a shot.  The bagels are great!  Again, the salt bagels here don't have the rocky salt that I'm used to but this place does a nice job.  The salt, everything, poppy and onion are delicious and they have a Hawaiian, which I didn't think would be good but I ended up loving it (it has coconut and I think pineapple).  The cream cheese is very good and they put the right amount on, at least for my taste.  I like the fact that these aren't the pale bagels you mostly see out here, these are crispy outside with a nice toasty brown color.\n\nHusband loves the weekend omelet sandwich.  Convenient location and parking - major plus.  I take bagels to go each time and I freeze them - these defrost and toast up great, another plus."
"2","The most amazing furniture that you can not find else where . The contemporary designs are all original . And the style of designs is beautifully . The quality is absolutely impeccable . And the staff is highly experienced and carry a lot of knowledge about furniture and design ."
"2","If you want to spend time on the internet and have a nice meal this is a great place for it.  Some things on the menu are better than others, but the ambiance is nice and the wifi works well."
"1","Came here for a cup of soup to go. I guess there is a spot for pick up orders and the regular line. I assumed since I was taking to go I would be able to order my soup and go since I had to be back in to work in 15 minutes. The girl at the register asked me for a pick up order and I told her I didn't know I had to call ahead and I just wanted a cup of soup to go. She informed me Id have to wait in the regular mile long line just to get a to go order because I had not ordered it on the phone. So I can go outside place the order on my phone and pick it up..but when it comes to asking you in the store I cant? If someone is getting something to go most of the time its because their in a hurry and need to get back to work. She was very rude and told me well the line is going pretty fast anyways. Well needless to say by the time I got the soup and returned to work my break was up and I couldn't even eat the soup! I really loved Wildflower but I that put such a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think I'll ever return."
"1","First and last time here. Location makes all the difference! The Wildflower across the street from McCormick Railroad Park has never messed up my order! This location was a disaster. Not only did they majorly mess up my order, I got my order to go, so I did not realize my order was wrong until after I drove all the way home and opened my bag. To start, this place asks for your name when you order, So they messed up my name and were calling out someone else's name for about 10 minutes before they realized it was my order. So there was a long wait, no where to sit, and because they did not make my order correctly, I basically had to throw it out. I was charged extra for things I did not receive, so I am mad about that. I will never go back there. I will stick with the Wildflower Bread Company by the railroad park."
"2","You would think this place is actually in Mexico given how long I had been meaning to try it.  I can only say, I should have gone sooner.  Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version.  I tried the green chile and loved it.   Decor is nothing to write home about, but not a complete dive either.  Service was excellent.\n\nI actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food, but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale.  Dinners run about $12 on average.  Lunch about $7.  They also have breakfast.  On the bad side, they apparently have a lunch buffet.  God only knows how big my ass will get knowing that tidbit of information.  Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing."
"2","Great food & service. Bridget is the BEST waitress!  A group of us go here for lunch about once a month and she knew our orders by heart after our 2nd visit. Would highly recommend the topopo salad and the lunch buffet."
"2","Excellent team of doctors. I highly recommend American Family Dentistry. I have been to many dentists around the valley, some very scarring experiences, & some first time appointments that I never did wind up scheduling a second. American family dentist is tried & true. Dr Lida D. Raoufi is beyond amazing - I have never met a doctor so warm, & nurturing while drilling holes in my teeth! & the dental assistants are such pros! They definitely know their stuff. Great, great staff.\n\n\nThe only reason I am giving four stars, is because unfortunately I had a couple root canals done here - however their referral to the doctor who managed to complete the procedure was lacking in skill. Years later I am now having problems, & am having to pay thousands more (even with insurance!) to get medicine put in it, drilled, & then re-done. If they would have been highly skilled in the first place - this wouldn't have even been necessary. I had also told the male doctor on staff about this problem - as I wasn't sure what it was looking like below the surface, but it was bothering me. & he didn't even bother to check it out. It was an obvious problem, as I was feeling it internally - then 5 year X-rays come & there is a TOTALLY apparent problem that easily could have been checked out, possibly corrected with less invasive techniques."
"1","Service was marginal and food was not very good.  I remember this place being better, but I guess they changed their menu around a bit ago.  Let's just say I like the old one better.  I will pass on this place moving forward."
"2","This location is clean, on time and has very professional, skilled therapists. One of the very best Massage Envy locations, I recommend it. Plus, when I  call last minute, they usually can accommodate me, such a bonus!"
"1","Very rude manager( Jennie ). Poor customer service. Employee Joyce was very disrespectful & will not be returning to this location."
"2","Very nice staff, I'm going to miss it as I move a little further away. However I use the online ordering and it's great to wish other stores did this"
"1","I usually would think one Burger King is the same as the next but....wow....this place was terrible! I got a coupon in the mail and saw they have a new chicken parm sandwich and I was in a hurry so I decided what the hell. After I ordered and I got to the window, the woman at the window didn't even acknowledge me. After a few minutes, she told me my total, I paid, she gave me my food and closed the window. Never heard another word after my total. That should have been an indication of what my food was going to be like. When I pulled up to the end of the drive thru, I opened my bag, unwrapped my sandwich and thought the bread was a bit cold. I took a bite into my sandwich only to find that bun was slightly frozen, the marinara sauce cold, the cheese frozen and the chicken lukewarm at best!  I put the car in reverse, went to the window and waited. The same woman opened the window, didn't say anything to me so I told her about the sandwich. I explained that the sandwich was cold and the cheese was frozen. Her reply?  Well after what seemed like an eternity of silence, her reply was \""no it's not. The cheese is cold though\"". I said \""noooo...the sandwich is cold and the bun is a bit frozen still\"". After snatching the sandwich out of my hand, she closed the window. A couple minutes later a guy handed me a bag with a new sandwich. Again, no words. Just window opened and then closed. I was afraid to open the bag but I was brave. This time the chicken was hot and everything was cold.  I couldn't even eat it. I just ended up throwing it away. They have lost my business."
"2","This is a course I keep coming back to time and time again.  I bought their OB Golf Club and have golfed most of their courses, and this is my favorite.  I bring my friends here when they visit, because with the OB card, they also get discounted rates.  And universally, after I ask them at the end of their visit, which of the OB courses they liked the best, it is Eagle Mountain.\n\nEvery time I have played, the condition of the course was immaculate. The advantage of this course, over the We-Ko-Pa courses, is that the carries aren't as bad, and seems to be more forgiving.  It is surrounded by homes, but they are back enough that they do not come into play.\n\nFinally the staff was friendly, and helpful.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that it took a long time to play.  Every time I have played it has been \""cart path\"" only, which really adds to the time it takes to play (especially if you are in the opposite rough).\n\nI highly recommend it to everyone, and it should be everyone's list of courses to play."
"1","Although I've never played this course, I give it one star because of their 48hr cancellation policy. If you are an out of town golfer do not book at this course, because if you can't make your round for any reason you WILL be charged regardless. \n\nYou've been warned."
"2","Our king room as very nice and spacious with a comfortable sitting area, fireplace and patio with a beautiful view of Gunsight mountain. The linens and towels were so soft and our bed was very comfortable too. The summer rates cannot be beat!! There were a few small elements of the room that were in need of repair but other than that it was very nice! We will recommend this hotel to our friends."
"1","After having had lunch at the Grill at Eagle Mountain Fountain Hills, AZ, we looked forward to being able to someday stay at the beautiful resort. A trip to AZ that was related to a recently deceased parent was made better with the fact that my husband booked a suite at the Inn at Eagle Mountain for the 1 night we needed to be in town. 6 weeks prior to our trip he made the reservations and we received confirmation. We looked forward to taking solace in the gorgeous surroundings. We arrived in Phoenix and as we were being shuttled to the car rental facility, my husband turned his phone on. A voice mail had been left from the Inn telling us they did not have a room for us. We immediately called to find out what the problem was and were told they \""we're very sorry, but...\"" they had no rooms available. When we explained we had confirmation from a reservation made through the hotel (not a travel outfit), they again apologized saying \""it appeared we had been 'mistakenly' wait-listed\"". They offered to find us a \""comparable place to stay\"".  We arrived at the Inn about 30 mins later. Our first question was why were we not notified until we had arrived in town. Their reply was that they were waiting to see if there might be a last minute cancellation. As an explanation we were told that new owners had recently taken over and were not well versed in the customer service aspect of hotel management. The receptionists agreed that this was unacceptable.  They did get us booked into another local hotel. Far from the beautiful ambiance of the Eagle Mt properties and the comfort of a king-size suite, we were directed to the nearby Marriott Courtyard, in a room with double beds. Disappointed, doesn't describe how we felt. A \""sorry\"" from the desk and absolutely no suggestion of compensation left us feeling as though we were unimportant as guests. So, no, we will not be returning to Inn at Eagle Mountain! We will not be recommending the Inn at Eagle Mountain."
"1","There are a handful of restaurants right on the park and this is one of them. We were attracted to the outdoor seating on a beautiful day. There is more seating outdoors than in and the inside feels more like a bar, with TVs playing sports. We came around 2:30pm and surprisingly had to wait for a table.\nOnce seated, the staff began service that was quite friendly, but as the meal went on, we got less and less attention and an apathetic attitude. I don't think it was anything we did. Our party of 4 each got entrees and shared an appetizer.\n\nI had the chicken wings mild which were quite weak. They make them crunchy here which is something I like but I wish I had gotten the hot ones. Mild just didn't do it for me. The lines for the bathroom were long and there were most certainly non customers using them. There is one bathroom for each gender that is a one-person-at-a-time kind. For a place that is named Euro Pizza, none of us got pizza, which should tell you something..."
"1","OMG!\nThe cashier doesn't even said hi to you!\nDoesn't she realized that we are the ones who paid her paycheck? From now on I think is worth to drive to Scottsdale to a different car wash then headaches here in f hills in this place!"
"1","Ridiculous.....only two people drying cars with 10 cars lined up on Sunday morning.  I was there for over 45 minutes and when I pulled in there were only 3 cars in front of me.  I really feel sorry for the 10 people behind me!  I told the cashier to ask the manager to come out, but he wouldn't.  Maybe he should have been out there drying the cars.  And they never have any order...they don't keep track of who came in earliest so that they do the cars in the order they arrived.  I will go down to Scottsdale from now on!"
"1","Dissappointing to say the least. Pizza crust is good but the add on's are just thrown on to a piece of cheese pizza and called good. Ray's still has the best by the slice! I won't be going back..."
"1","Visited with my mother one evening, as Appian Way has been her fave restaurant for many years. It is hard to respect a restaurant that serves cold butter in foil packets, not olive oil. Service was very slow, despite it being not that busy for a Saturday night. Had to wait a couple of times with empty waters, even had to flag a different waiter to top us off. The calamari was very good - tender, not greasy, and just a light dusting of breading. The meal took forever to arrive, despite being just a salad (DRENCHED in dressing) and an entree. The main entree was cold, as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time (I had a hunch since the folks who came in after us, a party of four, were served first, and attentively at that). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to acknowledge - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating. Might want to up your customer service skills. Fountain Hills has far to go in terms of reputable, delicious dining establishments, but I had thought this \""gem\"" would continue to be a favorite."
"2","Love this place! My mom has taken her pets here for a long time and I take mine here too! They are patient and caring! The fact that they can trim my Beagles nails and she has no problems with them whatsoever shows how awesome they are! Good prices too!"
"2","We have enjoyed going to Pei Wei for several years now, ever since PF Chang started  rolling out the concept nationally. \n\nThe food is really good and the selection from different Asian cultural foods is outstanding -- they serve Thai, Korean, and of course Chinese.  If you have never been to a Pei Wei think Panda Express with a more upscale menu and  a sit-down atmosphere for a modest price.\n\nA good example was our dinner last evening.  We came in around 5 pm, there was already a dozen or so patrons there.  We ordered their new three choice combo meal and soup and the bill came in for less then $20.00.  One of the managers came by to check if everything was prepared to liking and everything was delicious.   Nice!\n\nGo!  Enjoy!"
"1","Found a big piece of glass in my husband's lemon filled powdered donut this morning. \nThis is our go to store for donuts..they make them from scratch. \nThey are usually great... He swallowed some of it...I took it and the piece of glass back to the store and showed it to the Bakery Manager and I said I would take all the lemon donuts off the shelf....the store manager refunded my money.\nwhen I was leaving. . I noticed the lemon filled donuts were still on the shelf. ..\n\nBuyer beware..."
"1","The last few times we went in there were MANY dirty tables.  We walked in the other night and almost every table was uncleaned, the kid who worked there was just standing there; he made no attempt to say hello or make a move to bus the tables.  We loudly stated that if they couldn't even clean the tables, they probably wouldn't be able to serve us either, turned around, and walked out (we went to Euro Pizza instead).  Although I liked the food on past visits I am definitely turned off to Streets at this point, not sure if we will ever go back again.  \n\nI hope management reads this and does a reassessment of their business practices.  We need good places to eat in Fountain Hills.  Tell me you made changes and we will be back."
"2","This is my favorite course in the greater Phoenix area. The course is challenging, and the views are amazing!\n\nThis course is one that for some reason is generally overlooked as one of the best (in my opionion the best)  course in Phoenix. It is off the beaten path a lttile, (sitting in Fountain Hills) but is really worth the extra 10 minuet drive. Staff is excellent, The last 6 holes (the Wicked 6) are a fresh idea in ending a course, and I enjoy it thuroughly. \n\nThe practice green is well kept, and is a great determination of how the course greens are. The chipping green is one of my favorites in town.\n\nCart girls are friendly, and always smiling. Prices are just right!\n\nIm always coming back, and they never give me a reason to not come back!"
"1","I had eaten here 2 times previously and the service and food were both good \n This time , not so much. . My food was ok but not as hot. My server was a space cadet. She rushed me to order and when I asked for hot sauce and also asked for extra water for my tea bag I got neither.   Her tip reflected my displeasure. Avoid this place!"
"1","The food was what you should expect when going to Denny's but the staff just wasn't that good. I've almost never had a good waitress at Denny's before. Which granted the job does suck completely, BUT, you signed up for it so don't make everyone else's experience suck because of your incompetence. If you want Denny's then you should go. But do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs."
"2","First of all I want to say that I like this place because it's a hand wash and they do a pretty good job. The place is convenient because it's right by my house. The salesman is very friendly.  I'm very picky when it comes to clean, and they sure know how to impress me.  There's a waiting area which is good with air conditioning.\nI've been coming to this place for 2 years now and this has become my favorite car wash. If you're looking for a good car wash, I highly recommend this place!"
"1","Beware! Went to pick up my new Apple Iphone 5C and then was told that I had to pay $200.00, NO I wasn't told that when I ordered it on a promotion.  Had a very nice guy by the name of Carlo Torres help me with my FREE order and said he would call me when my phone was shipped but when I came in to get it a whole new ball game.  What a rip off."
"1","OK...I just walked back into my hotel room after a meal at this place. I think I'm being overly generous by even giving them one star.  Fact of the matter is I had no choice but to give them one because there was nothing lower.\n\nI had the #5 combination which consisted of one cheese enchilada (which was 1/100th of a percent decent), one shredded beef hard shell taco (which was perhaps the best thing on the plate), and one bean tostada (stale tostada).  I also ordered an overpriced ($7.95) chile relleno a la carte that tasted more like an \""effen\"" omelette.  C'mon now!!! The consistency of the egg covering the chile relleno should be fluffy and quickly fried.  This thing looked like and tasted as if they first made an Omelette and then wrapped it around a steamed chile....the chile wasn't even fire roasted!!!! \n\nFriends, I know real Mexican food....FINE Mexican food for that matter and this place IS NOT IT!  With all due respect to those of you who have written rave reviews about this place and of course to the proprietors, BUT I think I would have had a much better meal at the nearest taco bell, gladly paying the $25 bucks I laid down for a less than mediocre meal.  My recommendation to you all is .....DON'T BOTHER.  They should really consider dropping the \""FINE\"" from the name of this establishment.\n\nOn a good note - The lady tending bar that evening was very very nice and attentive.... unfortunately the service alone can't hold this place up."
"2","Finally as a long time Angel fan I hit up a spring training session in AZ. It did not disappoint at all. My wife and went out and got to catch a game and scored some autographs. We stayed at the Comfort Inn that was about a mile away and walked to Tempe Diablo so we didn't have to deal with the parking.  It was a Saturday game so it was sold out and pretty crowded. We lined up and scored a few autographs so I was pretty stoked. \n\nOur seats were in the Honey Brown Sweet Spot, which is the shaded area that is an all you can it section. (beast mode engaged) Seriously if you can get one of the tickets it will save you on a hot day and make sure your ready to eat. They serve up dogs, burgers and sausages. They also have peanuts, kettle chips and other little munchies that will keep you coming back for more. I was really hoping for a nacho bar. : ( \n\nI really enjoyed this little spot, its got a nice feel to it, its small and has a intimate feel. I got to meet the Angels owner Artie Moreno \n\nhttps://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/Ugczd5RBPZbZpvfXjAZDTQ/l.jpg\n\nI want to make it back here to support my favorite baseball team. Oh and the fact that they have Genesee on tap which is a domestic beer from Buffalo, NY which was really random. CHEERS!!!!!"
"1","First, this is my favorites Sub Factory location. It's the only one with the seafood sub. As a whole I'm not a huge fan of the chain, the food is low quality, bland, and unoriginal."
"1","If you like dated restaurants, with carpet that hasn't been clean in a decade, with an air quality that is stuffy and smelly, with long waits because they don't have enough waiters on the floor, and recipes that use the same 4 ingredients in all their dishes (one of them being LOTS of salt), then Riazzi's is the restaurant for you."
"2","My friends and I enjoyed the food and service. The place could use a, \""refresh and update\"" but I enjoyed it overall. The food alone was worth it. The desserts were homemade and spectacular."
"2","I'm really pleased with the services that we got at this place.  My wife and I are on a specialized meal plan that requires that we weigh and measure all of the food we eat.  This kind of planning and prep makes it very difficult to eat out.  However, the folks in the deli here were very helpful and accommodating to our requests in this regard.\n\nThen, when we were in the checkout line, our clerk offers us bags of ice to keep our food cold on the way home.  This is far and away better service than the Whole Foods in San Mateo back in the Bay Area.  I even remarked to my wife that I wish they could just pick the whole building up and relocate this Whole Foods to the San Francisco area.  We'd come often for the great service.  Prices are higher here than at Safeway, etc., but you are definitely getting what you pay for."
"2","This is the only Whole Foods i have been to , so i will have to check out some others as well.This one is quite close to my house is i like it.   They have wonderful selections on everything. Fruits, veg, meat, seafood.                                                    They even have clothing, shoes and purfume.  Vitamin selection is out the roof!         So much to choose from. The one draw back,very high prices.                                      Though they will give you $$$of your bill , if you bring in your own bags.                      When you want to to treat yourself to a great shopping experiance this is place.             I feel that you will really enjoy it!"
"2","3.5 STARS\n\nFOOD: I love my sandwiches, and Dilly's always satisfies me. The sandwiches are pretty big. I like the Smokey Mountain because any sandwich with bacon in it is twice as good as those without! I think you get a free cookie with your sandwich, not sure though. \n\nPRICE: Around $7 for a sandwich\n\nATMOSPHERE: Nothing amazing, but definitely good enough to sit down at.\n\nSKINNY: For those of you who love your sandwiches for lunch, go to Dilly's Deli and you shouldn't be disappointed."
"2","Soup and sandwich combo is good, enough to split!"
"1","So I decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker. The ordering was easy enough and I was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am... I though sure not a problem... It got here at 1230... After I called to ask what was taking so long. No apologies or nothing... If you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly! It's my lunch hour! It was shortened thanks to you and your employees who don't give a damn. 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip.. Shoulda ordered something good for this price. I got the turkey sandwich  and it was rather forgettable. I don't think I will be ordering from this establishment again. Shoulda just got in n out."
"2","I have eaten here twice and highly recommend it if you're a fan of savory bagels.\nThe first time I went here I had an everything bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. Both were very good. They have quite a few coffee options: 6 coffees and various creamers/milks, including vanilla half and half, which I used. I got my friend an egg and cheese on a bagel and everything seemed to be made fresh. \n\nI would not rate them 4 stars for the blueberry bagel I tried the next visit (though the strawberry cream cheese was very good). The coffee was, once again, very good. They also do free refills on the coffee, which is pretty fantastic. This time, I ate there and noticed they have some really interesting cream cheese flavors that I look forward to trying on future visits. \n\nThe service was really nice both times. The people working here were enjoyable and the food was ready quickly."
"1","8 bucks and change for 4 mediocre bagels and some disgusting strawberry cream cheese.. No thanks.. Not again"
"1","Arizona Mills has the worst bathrooms I have ever been in. They are always really, really smelly and warm.\n\nI like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.\n\nThe mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\n\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by. They wont leave you alone. They also have two or three of those carts that sell lotion. I have had people chase me into stores trying to get me to buy natural sea potions. It's just annoying and always makes my shopping experience uncomfortable."
"1","I made a few trips to this mall during our week in the Phoenix area.  \n\nThe Nike Outlet was great, but otherwise, there weren't that many quality outlet stores.  Most (or so it seemed to me) of the stores in this mall are not outlets and there just weren't the deals that I was expecting."
"1","This is not the place to go if you are in a rush.  If you want to be in and out, do NOT got in.  If you want to walk fast, it's impossible.\n\nBut if you're looking for a slow jaunt and don't mind people stopping right in front of you, this is the place for you.\n\nSome decent food places, the usual, plus Nathan's Hot Dogs.  Rain Forrest Cafe can be fun too, but that's a whole different review."
"1","I have been going to AZ Mills because it has a store that I like to shop in - the Arizona Territory store, which has lots of cute stuff.  Since I live in New Mexico, a lot of their merchandise is similar to that I would find in Albuquerque, but haven't been able to find at all.  So I go there to buy certain items.\n\nFound out last night that a couple of the things that I buy at AZ Mills are available at Fry's---much less expensively!  I don't think I'll be going to AZ Mills any more."
"2","I am a huge fan of this outlet mall since it has good stores with affordable prices for clothes, accessories and other items. One store that is definitely my favorite is Solstice Sunglass Outlet, which offers high end sunglasses for prices up to 70% off the original price. It has fast become my source for designer sunglasses (have purchased two pairs of Dior Homme sunglasses for less than 130 dollars each!). It's also a good place to window shop and to spend a nice weekend. It is an obligated stop everytime I'm in town!"
"2","Rock the Rivas!\n\nIt's _bertos clone type shop.\n\nEverything is good and fresh... \n\nIt's cheap and quick.\n\nTheir Carne Asada is better than amado's and filli b's.\n\nHit it up after you're nice and drunk from rocking out at the Yucca Tap Room!"
"1","I was leaving REI today and decided to stop in for a taco and a burrito at Taco Nazo. I am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any. This place will be on the list of \""Do not Return\"".  \n\nThe beans in my burrito were soupy and tasted burnt, and the shredded beef in the taco tasted like beef jerky. They also charge for chips and salsa. Lame."
"1","At best this is mediocre food, the hot sauces were not, the chili rellano was a rice filled burrito with one strip of chile and no rellano. Don't go here."
"1","Small plastic fork. Let's start there. I had the fish tacos and they were edible only because I was starving. Poor excuse for salsa bar. Service was ok served with a smile at least but all in all food was horrid. At least it is hard to mess up Horchata :) \n\nRivas or Filly B's next time I need a quick Mexican dive fix for lunch or very early AM snack."
"1","Just under $9.00 for a combo #2 Pork Burrito, rice & beans with a medium Melon drink.  The Burrito was dry, meat greasy, beans runny and only a few spoonfulls of pico de gallo in the condiment tray.  No Salsa verde or any red sauce at all.  Staff was surly and made me feel like I bothered them to eat there.\n\nWhy didn't I read the Yelp reviews before stopping in ..."
"1","A perfectly acceptable strip mall Mexican joint that happens to be next to REI, which I found particularly convenient on the two occasions I had to go there during a recent trip to Arizona. Just thinking about the homestyle dishes they serve here is making me hungry for Mexican food right now. You fuckers are spoiled in the Southwest, I hope you know that. We don't get cafeteria food of this caliber where I'm from. One tip: don't order coffee.\n\nOne tip for the owners: is the gigantic TV really necessary? Also, get better coffee."
"2","Clean, affordable, and friendly. What else can you ask for? After being driven out of my boyfriend's apartment by bed bugs, we needed a place to stay for the night. Although there were less expensive places to grab a room for the night, I always come to Hawthorn. The front desk is respectful and friendly (take notes, Extended Stay on University!), the beds are comfortable, and the AC is cold!! Consistency of service is rare these days, but you can find it here."
"1","How do restaurants like Joe's Crab Shack thrive?  Let me tell you a little story.  It might sound like I'm complaining about my (future) in-laws, but I'm not.  I promise.\n\nMy fiance's parents love the Crab Shack.  Every year, we all spend a week in Coronado, California for a much-needed escape from the desert.  Every year, we find ourselves driving across the bridge into San Diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of Joe and his under-motivated teenage staff.  Every year, my meal both amazes and disappoints me.  How awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse?  I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools.\n\nOne time, we had a waiter that kept calling all the men \""bro.\""  I am not your bro.  I am paying for and eating food that would get even a Red Lobster cook fired and, as such, am entitled to no less than five-star treatment.\n\nIf there is anything positive to say, it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crab are HILARIOUS.  I've got the pictures to prove it.\n\nI'll visit the Shack once per year out of obligation.  I'll even be (sort of) happy to do it, considering those close to me seem to love it and I'm not going to rain on their parade.  You will never ever ever ever ever ever find me at one in Arizona, however.  Ever!"
"1","Yikes.. I should have checked the Yelp before going here for my FIRST EVER CRAB LEGS EXPERIENCE. Is this place specifically designed to annoy? As we sat there eating very mediocre crab (it's not supposed to taste really fishy right?), the volume of the music doubled and all of the employees line danced to \""COTTON EYED JOE\"" by Rednex which is possibly the most annoying song of all time. This lasted roughly two minutes and was followed by a Smashmouth song. To add to the annoyance factor, there are multicolored Christmas lights strewn throughout the restaurant and the staff wears tie-dye shirts. Thinking about it is giving me a headache. Would maybe go back as a joke. The hush puppies were good."
"1","wow..where to begin...I guess it's really my fault for thinking a chain could do shrimp and grits but the photo looked so good...sucker. When the food finally arrived it was in a cast iron pan and was luke warm..the biscuit was a hockey puck, the shrimp was\nsuper gritty...gross.The grits had a weird texture, more like over processed polenta. I thought I could just eat the grits on the second round, they were hot but terrible, I tried hot sauce...that didn't work, it was suppose to have sausage which was exactly 2 small pieces that I had to look for and tasted like processed hot dog. So I paid for the service, left hungry and went somewhere else...how sad never again Joe."
"1","Used to be good back around...1999-2000 or so. I had great memories and used to love the food there. However, more recently a bf who had heard me make good comments about the food, took me there and the food was not good at all. It was edible, but there was more of a \""fishy\"" not fresh taste this time. I know not to expect most seafood in AZ to be as fresh as if we were on the beach, but it used to be great. They no longer had some of the menu items they used to. It just wasn't impressive and certainly didn't live up to the memories I had.\n\nGood news is I no longer crave it and have to travel across town and spend the money to go there. :)"
"1","Service has been a wee bit slow. Bad luck is table/waitress. Hope the food is better."
"1","They refused to let me switch out fried rice for chow mein. The food was mediocre, chicken was dry and my friend got a crab puff that had absolutely nothing in it. The flavor was bland for everything too. The restaurant itself was really run down."
"1","Salads are very iceberg-heavy.  Not bad, just old-fashioned.  Nothing remarkable.  My daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen.\n\nChicken Pot Pie ( \""NEW\"" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.\n\nFrench fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.\n\nWorst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.  NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips.\n\nI only went there because I had a BOGO entree' coupon.  Not worth it at all.\n\nP.S.  I have eaten here several times (mostly because of coupons) and they all fell below 3 stars."
"1","Smells like a public restroom in the diner. Avoid at all costs!!!"
"1","Took this firm four tries to fix my air conditioner last July.  Wouldn't have cared except for the 115 degree temperatures at that time.  Would recommend avoiding this firm at all costs."
"1","My fiance and I just left there. We are drunk and happy, so most food, at this point, would be pleasing to the palate. \n\nHowever, as we sat there debating the 17 pounds of inedible food left on our plates, here was our conversation:\n\n\""We just paid $17 for this shit?\""\n\n\""Yep.\""\n\n\""Should we take it home to the dogs?\""\n\n\""I don't really feel comfortable giving it to them, do you?\""\n\n\""Nope.\""\n\nAnd so then, we threw that crap in the trash can.\n\nThat about sums it up. Next time, I will indulge in Jack in the Box tacos: 2 for $0.99."
"1","Dear Filly B's,\n\nI have loved you long time, we were bff for nearly 10 years... that is until you gave me food poisoning. I will never eat carne asada again thanks to you. I knew we wouldn't last forever, nothing that hot and heavy ever lasts long."
"1","Came here on my lunch break for a simple $5 meal. I waited in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes. The last five minutes of waiting took place AFTER I had finally paid. TOO SLOW!!! You would think in all that time I would get my meal the way I asked, without lettuce. But they actually went and put extra lettuce. So rediculous. Never had problems at this Fili B's before until today. Not going back."
"1","Usually my stop before heading into my account if I am working the night shift.  The food is a'ight.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito and often find that the cheese isn't melted.  Which is crazy that it isn't warmer considered how long the wait is."
"1","Horrible food. My bun was hard and the onion rings tasted like old grease. They forgot my husband's french fries and of course, we didn't realize it until we were down the road. Will not return."
"2","This place is pretty rad.  They recently finish a 2000sf + expansion and patio expansion.  The food is inconsistently good.  Really good during the days when the daytime bartender is cooking... I know for a fact they use Kraft Ranch.  \n\nMonday night trash talk poker is a blast.  \n\nTues is an awesome trivia night with a funny big guy hosting to a quality crowd.  \n\nWed is college night.  They start off with volleyball at the park across the street then real cheap drinks w college id and karaoke.\n\nThurs night is my favorite.  Beer Olympics!  a Coed tournament with 5 games, pool, darts, shuffle board, beer pong, bags and Gift Certificates for Gold, Silver and Bronze followed by their resident DJ Bon Joke.  He's pretty good. He mixes Karaoke with his videos and  DJ tracks and makes you wanna sing.   \n\nDJ Bon Joke is also the featured entertainment on Friday and Sat.  \n\nFinal Round is probably the only bar in Tempe I'd give 5 stars to."
"1","I have been coming to xtreme bean for several years and it is still a generally good place.  the coffee is average or below, the tea selection is good, the atmosphere is ok but same old. The current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling, and even barking, at high decibels.  I've never seen anything like  it anywhere.  I'll have to think twice about coming back if this continues."
"1","Worst Customer Service EVER. And I'm not kidding.... would seriously give this place zero stars if I could. \n\nMy fiance and I went here Friday night at about 11:30 because our usual place was closed. I had been here a few times in high school, and the coffee was okay but always tasted slightly weird. This time, we waited in line behind two guys for more than 15 minutes while they sipped their already served coffee and talked with the employee working behind the counter. The employee could clearly see that we were in line and waiting, and continued to not care. They chatted about records etc while we just stood there.\n\nTo make matters worse, another employee came in from the back of the coffee shop and could also see that we were waiting, but didn't help us, or remind the first employee to help us either. He must have known the two guys standing there and chatting (or at least I hope he did) because he walked up and touched one of the two guys' crotch. The guy then loudly said \""He touched my pee-pee! He touched my pee-pee! Did he touch yours?\"" While the employees and the other guy laughed. The second employee walked away and the first continued chatting. I wish I was kidding, but this seriously happened in this establishment. I was so astounded at the lack of any sense of professionalism. Needless to say, my fiance and I walked out and did not ever get our coffee, not to mention we will clearly never be returning.\n\nI have tried to write their management to inform them of our experience, but there is also no where on their site to contact them directly by email, another huge faux pas for a company.\n\nBasically, don't honor this establishment with your business. Use your consumer power elsewhere."
"2","very good!!!\n\nreally nice employees!\n\nTons of sugar free options!!\n\n\nCons: its that kind of place you can expect to see people who are not fond of the shower. Avoid them by using the drive through window. The free wifi is nice!\n\nIf I'm going someplace to work - I prefer the ambiance at Sbux."
"2","still my FAV"
"1","My husband and I ate at the Siamese Cat for the first time last night. I am very disappointed in all the dishes we ordered.\n\nWhen trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time, my husband I always get our favorite dishes. We ordered Laab Gai, chicken satay, phad kee Mao (drunken noodles) and phad bai kra prao. It's a lot of food but like most Asians, we like variety in our meal. \n\nThe satay came out first and it was ok. Nothing memorable- you could taste a hint of the curry power but not much. The peanut sauce was super oily. \n\nNext was the Laab - I had high hopes for this because it usually is always good everywhere I go but this dish was much too salty.\n\nThe noodle dish was the worst dish. The noodles were really hard.  I could tell they did not warm up the noodles enough before cooking it. Also, there was no flavor to this dish at all. A big disappointment as phad kee Mao is always flavorful with the sauce and basil. \n\nLastly the stirfry tasted nothing like what it should have tasted like. It was a typical stir fry and it was quite dry. \n\nOverall we phad 33 for everything so the food was cheap. The service is better than most Asian restaurants so we tipped our waitress well.  Sadly, we will not return because not one dish we ordered was anything near our expectations."
"2","helpful funny and nice staff. always try to get your the best deal weather it's a coupon from the paper or your insurance they want to get your the glasses you want for a good price. doctors are informative during procedure and always keep appointments."
"2","Called on a Thursday, they got me in the next day for my eye exam.  Had to wait a little, but the exam was quick, professional, and dead-on in terms of contacts and glasses prescription.  Selecting the frames was easy and they put together/priced a package for me in record time.  1 week because of custom lenses--and they were done and ready for pickup in exactly a week.  In the meantime the trial contacts had started to bother me so I called and asked if they could revert me back to my \""old\"" lens type with the new RX.  They did so willingly, ordered the trial lenses, and everything arrived on the same day to be picked up concurrent with my new lenses--which were perfect by the way.  Very happy with this location, particularly as I have had bad luck with other LensCrafters in other states in the past.  I'll keep coming here for my glasses needs!"
"1","I was born and raised in the Greater Seattle Area, but I don't consider myself a coffee snob. I don't even drink that much of it. My orders are always the same, tall soy latte with no flavor at 120 degrees. Such a simple order that is only improved (or unimproved as is the case here) by the type of soy milk used or the coffee beans. \n\nThis coffee stand is located inside of a mall and because of this most likely has a large overhead. That overhead gets passed on to me the consumer, naturally, and what should be a $2.50 drink becomes a $3.75 drink. Not a big deal normally, however, IT IS when the product being put in my cup and subsequently going down my throat is not even worth the cup that separates my hand from the scorching liquid within. \n\nTwo stars GJC."
"2","YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.\n\nYC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.  Chances are good you'll end up with enough leftovers for at least another meal or two.  Just don't forget, doggie bags are 50 cents a piece, so bring some quarters or singles."
"1","Was brought here by a couple of friends who kept raving about the food.  My first and last time.  I begged them to try another place to compare.  \n\nThe meat resembled rolled up frozen deli meat of poor quality.  Nothing fresh, very tasteless and dry.  The selection of veggies looked sad and very picked-over.  I was disappointed that there was not an option of adding an egg.  And the starch choice was noodles or plain rice, that's all.  Lots of choices of sauces but they still couldn't make it delicious.\n\nBut wait...  free frozen yogurt!  I could care less.  I eat at Mongolian grills for the Mongolian, not crappy generic soft serve.  And then to be charged for a to-go box?  That's ridiculous.\n\nI will go to Genghis Grill instead.  Quality trumps quantity any day (not to mention actual service.)  Even the Mongolian Grill at the Banner Desert hospital cafeteria is better as far as taste and quality goes (not to mention WAY cheaper.)"
"2","When I was the young age of 3, my mom brought me to YC's. I have been going ever since. This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their \""grill warriors\"" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless. Their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful. Not to mention, it is very affordable. I highly recommend everyone to \""mongo\"" at YC's Mongolian Grill!"
"2","I love coming here! The staff is fantastic, there's a huge chalkboard wall, candy, ice cream, shaved ice, drinks, plus water and ice of course. It's an amazing atmosphere. They have a wall filled with photos of customers. Best place to get great tasting water!"
"2","Always stop here for a bag each of candy-shelled chocolate-covered peanuts and chocolate-covered almonds from the bulk section.  Love the organic Mountain Fresh and Brown Cow yogurts.  As for the produce I buy here, I must first say that I triple-, sometimes quadruple-inspect my options before I purchase at any grocery I shop at, and I've only had to complain about the strawberries here at Sunflower.  All other fruits and the veggies were fine.  Wish I could say the same about the other farmer's market whose name rhymes with snouts...\n\nDon't know if this place still sells Berto's gelato and Laloo's goat milk ice cream as it's been close to a year since I last purchased, but you must check these items out as they taste out-of-this-world!  The prices are also very wallet-friendly compared to AJ's, but really, that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
"2","Now I know that I stopped by the Sunflower Market in the middle of a work day, but this place was totally abandoned. I think 2 other customers came in after me, but essentially I was alone in a natural foods wonderland, and hey, that's okay with me. Especially since this branch has some hot male employees...anyway what am i reviewing here? \n\nPretty big store front, bigger than most of the Whole Foods I've patronized back home, and a good selection of food that doesn't seem over-the-top granola-y. The produce wall is GORGEOUS, i could just envision making the world's biggest and most beautiful salad. The icing on the cake (for me at least) is their bulk food bins, with everything from Live Yeast and Bulgher to Cinnamon Licorice and Crystallized Ginger.  I bought a big bag of Wasabi Peas and some ginger to tide me over on my afternoon excursion.\n\nHopefully an empty store at lunch time doesn't mean a struggling store because Sunflower Market is lovely!"
"2","Go shopping for a half hour here and at any of the other grocery stores around, check out.  You'll have saved money and will have more actual food, less packaging and less chemicals.\n\nAs far as local grocery stores go, this one is my favorite.  The meat and produce are better priced and of better quality than any of the chains around.  Chicken breasts are consistently $3.00 a pound here, can't beat that.\n\nThe staff here are knowledgable, kind and interested in their jobs.  I try to do all of my shopping here as I think it makes me healthier and definetly saves me money."
"2","I like this store a lot! They really go the extra mile to make it nice.          Very similar to Sprouts. I don't know if they are owned by the same people or not .  They give you 10cents off your bill for everyone of your forever bags that you bring in. That is the best deal i know of. Plus, they even have coffee out if you would like a sample. While shopping.     They have a deli which only provides Boar's Head. Which is a very good thing. No additves and GMO in it.   they will cut your meat and cheese any thickness you like and they put paper inbetween each slice. Which is a wonderful thing.   They even have Organic wine for a very good price.    Very many good things at this store , and well worth the visit."
"1","This store was amazing when it was Sunflower, now they are constantly out of stock on lots of items and the management seem to be a bunch of nimrods. \nThey don't even carry Sriracha anymore. WTH?"
"2","pretty girls but no lollipop selection."
"2","During my kitchen remodel I ate at pizza hut a lot more than I ever intended to. It actually got to the point where the guy working knew who I was. I don't remember the mangers name but he's a cool dude and once when there was an issue with a payment he helped me out. Now that my kitchen is done I don't eat there often but I do make sure to buy a pizza at least once a month with those guys."
"1","Thought it was pretty sad that they charge $10 to have your X-rays emailed over to a new dentist (I moved therefore needed a new dentist). As a former customer, I would think they could include that as a courtesy, I've never charged for this by any other dental office. Granted its only $10, its the principal behind it."
"1","Went there for a NBA Playoff Game (Suns vs. Spurs) about a year ago.  It was crowded and there were many drunk dirty boys trying to score - ewwe!  It has the potential to be a nice little-hole-in-the-wall place, but as it stands currently-not so much.  Would not recommend this place."
"2","Great place to watch football, they have tons of tv's everywhere! They have a great deal for domestic pitchers $6.75! There food and service is really good too. However, it is hard to get good cell phone service in there, so that's a little disappointing."
"2","Absolute great place to learn or just squeeze in a quick 9-hole round. Clubhouse serves a great lunch/dinner, live music at nights later in the week, and ice-cold Hopshock always on tap. Service of the pro shop and the restaurant is pretty good.\n\nThe best part about Shalimar are the lessons from Tyler and Paul. I was a TERRIBLE golfer when I started earlier this year. My swing is starting to get there with their help and I couldn't be happier. Buckets are reasonable priced to work on your swing, and a 9-hole round with cart is pretty cheap (especially now).\n\nFootGolf is a great idea and fun to play. It can be challenging at times for actual golfers to play around the big groups, but if you check their schedule on when the FootGolfers are allowed, they are easily avoided. Heck, buy a 6-pack from the clubhouse and play a round of FootGolf for yourself and see why the popularity is growing.\n\nAll-in-all, I love going to Shalimar. I have made it my home course while I am learning to play the game and I would recommend it to others."
"1","we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight. I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally, but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores, and will stop losing long time customers like us.  I always finished up with their chili, but now it's an additional $3.49, and no more hot chocolate chip cookies. BTW, no more coupons either, so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal..."
"1","I like the new look but hate the confusing new set up. It's all, \""I'm a buffet, but nope no I'm not!\"" \nOrdered the 1/4 white chicken with mashed potatoes & bacon & onion Mac & cheese. Comes with complimentary bread. Chicken was good and moist. Mashed potatoes have no taste and Mac & cheese is dry without the slightest taste of cheese! Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food."
"2","Best buffet hands down!!\n\nI love healthy eating, and I also love buffets. This is the best of both worlds for me.\n\nThe salads and topping always taste fresh and the soups are always very tasty. I love how they rotate specialty items every week it seems so you get to try new soups, salads, desserts and more. \n\nYou could eat super healthy here, but you can also fill up to the point that you need to be rolled out very quickly. Even the kids plate you can get for the little ones has more than enough room for plenty of food. \n\nAs far as this location specifically, it is my favorite. They recently remodeled not only their decor, but their overall operating structure in general. Definitely a vast improvement to what they were and compared to some of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations. Sine the change, I have not had a bad experience here."
"1","The price of bowling wasn't bad; the food was WAY over priced. They charged my organization $11/person for pizza and soda. It was a giant rip off. That was worth $6-7 tops. Overall, I wouldn't recommend them. Not worth the price we had to pay."
"1","Stay away. Had them put a budget boost on my New Jeep Wrangler, day after i started having \""death wobble\"". Darwin coaxed me into buying a new steering stabilizer to \""fix\"" the problem. SS only masks the wobble from the driver until it's severe. Went back in to purchase a new HD trac-bar, again Darwin told me that's not the issue and up-sold me Into an AEV lift because he \""guaranteed\"" it would fix the death wobble. Within two days I was still having wobbles. I finally went in and bought the Trac-bar I originally had intended to get before Darwin led me $2500 down a rabbit hole. Sure enough trac-bar significantly reduced the frequency of my wobbles, but hasn't fully eliminated them. Darwin and his staff have been nothing but condescending when I've come in with my issues. I wouldn't spend another dime with these guys."
"2","I would have never have even known about this place without this website.  It's tucked in the corner of a stripmall, pretty much across the parking lot from a Starbucks.  I wish I could sit in front of that store and direct them across the way to a place where your coffee doesn't taste like someone burned it.  \n\nI've had several drinks here, all have been good.  Pastries are always freshly made.  \n\nIt's probably really a 4 star-ish place, but they get the extra star because the girl making my drink was wearing an Illini shirt.  Definite bonus points."
"1","If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.\n\nI live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.\n\nNot only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.\n\nThey use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  \n\nThe espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross\n\nAnd finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. \n\nThe steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. \nWhich is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.\n\nI wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  \n\nHundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  \n\nIf you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  \nIf you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.\nIf you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.\n\nNever going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday."
"2","We had some time to kill after a movie, so we stopped in after seeing a sign for free game play with a movie ticket. They offer 30 minutes of free gaming, all you have to do is show your ticket stub from Harkins - score! We were able to get our fill in that 30 minutes, so I'm not sure how they are making $ on this deal, but we look forward to doing this again. I was kind of confused as to where you would order food. The place isn't laid out well and it seems as if they are short staffed. Would be a great place for a kids party."
"1","Ugh.  \n\nI wanted a teriyaki bowl.  I might have wanted a sandwich.  Hell, I might have wanted a cup of frogurt. \n\nWhat I didn't want was to pay $9 for an all-white meat chicken bowl because if I had wanted the cheaper mixed-meat bowl, I would have had to wait 20 minutes because they were out.  Too bad for me, I was on lunch and hungry and already there.  WOMP WOMP WOMP.  \n\nSo I expect something grand for $9 but get something that isn't even quite as good as Kyoto Bowl or Samurai Sam's, two places that are cheaper and quicker by far.\n\nThe rice was blah, the chicken was meh, and the sauce wasn't really all that great either.  My co-worker went there the next day, got a sandwich, found 3 hairs in it, and when she went back, the manager told her they'd make her a new one but they wouldn't refund her money.  \n\nYeah, it's not indicative of every single eating experience there, and the teriyaki bowl wasn't horrible, just horribly overpriced (which is why they get two stars instead of one), but unless they have some manner of overhaul, they can eat my balls."
"2","My wife and I have been taking our children here for the past 5 years and cannot say enough great things about the care our children recieve there.  The front office staff is always curteous and quick to respond, they always answer their phone, and offer same-day appts.  When you have a sick child the last thing you want to resort to doing is taking them to an urgent care or the ER and EVCC does a great job of always accomodating us the same -day, sometimes within an hour of us calling for an appointment!  Dr. Curan and his staff are not just great with kids, they are excellent at communicating thoroughly with parents as well.  We never feel rushed or leave with any unanswered questions.  We \""shopped' around a lot for a good pediatrician prior to our son being born and actually tried a couple others before landing here at East Valley Children's Center.  As far as we are concerned our children will be seen at this office until they are not \""children\"" anymore."
"2","Great shop. Went in with the intent of buying a Trek Madone 3.1 on a killer deal. They had my size in stock and ready to go. Just added some Shimano SH11 pedals and a couple bottle cages on it. Took maybe 25 minutes or so and I got great help from Noah. All the guys were knowledgeable and cool. Landis has been in business for a long time for good reason. Great equipment, good prices, good availability, knowledgeable and cool people. Highly recommended."
"2","I have been in this shop several times and always with such great service. Today I bought a new bike and again the service was awesome. Very knowledgeable and honest.  Salesman didn't try to upsell me. When I came to pick up the bike, the young men that helped me was absolutely friendly and great to deal with. He took the time to watch me ride, got my seat set, put new pedals on and got me set up with a great front and rear light set. I highly recommend this shop!"
"1","Worst experience my boyfriend and I have ever had going out to eat. Food was cold and looked and tasted like it was all microwaved. Table and booth was dirty and sticky. If you want a quick but good breakfast definitely go to U.S Egg"
"2","Venezia's is by far the best place to get a slice in Tempe. 2 slices and a drink for $5.50, and the slice are huge and can be hard for me to finish. The pizza is always fresh and hasn't been sitting out all day like at Slices. The wings and salads are average, but will get the job done when needed. The sandwiches are legit, but stick to the pizza, you won't be disappointed. It used to be an awkward table set up but they just re-did the seating. Bottom line it's the best NY style slice around!"
"1","When I first moved to Tempe this was one of the best places for a slice. However more recently they have been getting pretty bad in quality. I actually prefer some of the cheaper places in the area because their quality has gone down so much."
"2","Love this place for pizza! Usually come for lunch since they have great lunch specials. The slices are a decent size and tastes delicious!"
"2","This is by far my favorite pizza place in arizona. It is inexpensive and the slices are huge and delicious! Can't get any better."
"2","Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future. \n\nWe were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings. \n\nThe tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. \n\nVery satisfied with our first experience."
"1","I wish I could write a good review but after being asked to get an MRI, which I sent over to the clinic, I got a message from Dr Wolf saying he wanted to speak with me. I called and called and called. I never got a return call so in frustration decided, if this is the way I'm being treated before I pay for services how will it be after I give them my money. I decided it wasn't worth the risk as I would be traveling from out of town to see Dr Wolf. All I can say is I've never been treated like this before and subsequently asked for my MRI back and pursued other options. They obviously didn't care about getting a new patient. All in all a very frustrating experience."
"1","I called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tires with an \""out the door\"" price including mounting and balancing. Purcell quoted less expensive than the rest. I agreed, made an appointment and they ordered the tires. When I got there they tried to sell me the scam tire insurance (It only adds replacement coverage for the 2% of punctures which are not repairable, and only at their chain) and I declined. The price which I was quoted was not the price I paid. They had two individual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and added a materials fee. It was about $70.00 over the \""out the door\"" price, which became more expensive the last time I purchased identical tires elsewhere and competitor's phone quotes. \n\nThey opened my hood and poked around while I was not present without my permission, then tried to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire. There is NO reason to open my hood during a tire transaction. It took almost two hours to change four tires despite an appointment and not being busy. This week I got a coupon in the mail, since they also added me to their mailing list without asking. I won't be using it. \n\nI'll give them some credit, though- they didn't take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work. There is obviously a reason why business is slow for this shop when the scammable ASU students are away and why they have no reputation on Yelp. I gave two stars because the product itself is what I asked for and they were installed properly. They did do something right."
"1","The owner was nice but very pushy on me ordering the specials. They didn't have what I wanted (grilled chicken burger) so I went with a falafel which seemed to upset him. My order came with soup, I chose lentil. That was very good. The falafel however was just not good at all. My tastebuds just could not agree with the sauce or ingredients."
"1","This place has tasteless food that is over priced. It is not very far from my house and would be easy to stop at but I choose to go to Suzie's, or Poncho's in Phoenix. If you want good Mexican food do your self a favor and go somewhere else."
"1","This restaurant was just okay to me.  I ordered a thin crust and it was just average.  The garlic cheese bread was the best part of the meal. It was tasty.  The staff was friendly, so that was a plus."
"1","Never order a sandwich from a.place with \""Pizza\"" in the name. The beef in my sandwich was good, but the bread was soggy and gross. I ordered fries but got chips. After 20 minutes I'm STILL waiting for fries with no update from my server. It isn't even busy in here. Not too pleased.\n\n(EDIT) - Later on my sandwich was so soggy that the bread ripped in half and all the fillings fell out. Grr. No more Nello's for me~"
"1","This place has completely gone down hill.  I just ate here after several years of visiting other pizza places and I was sad to see what it has become.  I have never seen a restaurant skimp on a pizza as bad as this place did.  Hardly any sausage, tomatoes sliced as thin as a piece of paper and no garlic on the pizza which was ordered.  They never have enough sauce but I expected that and always get a side.  Ridiculous.  Beer was even flat.  Oregano's blows this place away.  I have been in town for 25 years and went to Nello's all the time 15 years ago.  So sad to see how they have gone cheap on their pizza.  If you are looking just to get full, go for it.  If you want any type of quality, look elsewhere."
"1","I was wound up like a little girl all day waiting and waiting to go to our 8:20pm showing of Polar Express in 3D at the IMAX.  I had seen the movie when it came out and loved it.  I'm pretty much a sucker for anything Tom Hanks does.  I knew it was a great movie, but I was on pins and needles waiting to see it with my hubby.  It was his first time to see the magic of the movie or a one in 3D at an IMAX.\n\nThe magic was washed away as soon as I stepped into the holding area to the theatre.  It was a dreary, depressing, uncomfortable place to wait until the theatre doors were ready.  I saw that there was popcorn, MY FAVORITE PART OF A MOVIE, but it I wasn't hit with the scent of seduction when I walked in.  To me, that means old, cold popcorn.  Grrr.\n\nAfter our tickets were taken, we made our way through the filthy hall to our seats.  Oh yeah- they are assigned.  What's up with that?  Luckily, there weren't many people so we sat where we wanted without a problem.  The seats were stained with God knows what, arm rests were broken, seats were broken.  It was disgusting.  I have been in multiple IMAX theaters in Florida and they have all been pristine!  Where, exactly, is my $15.00 going?\n\nThe sound is amazing, the screen is awesome and 3D is incredible.  That's the only thing they've got going for them.\n\nAfter I left, I was thrilled with the movie but I felt like I needed to have a lice screening."
"2","We went w/ some friends to see the Dark Knight here recently. Dont let the blandness of the concessions lobby fool you, youre in for an \""experience\"" (cuz they call it the IMAX experience, get it?). Its a Harkins (basically) so you can use your souvenier cups. The concession staff was very friendly. They even had our hot food made and brought over from the regular Harkins in AZ Mills cuz they didnt think theirs would be ready in time for us to catch our movie.\n\nThe actual theater is very daunting. That screen is HUGE! Careful, the stairs are very steep. We had seats in about the middle of the theater. The sound quality was great. It was a great way to see a great action flick. Not sure I'd opt for Imax everytime, but for this film it was worth the extra $."
"1","I came here for baby clothes. They have a good selection of brands: carters, gerber, gymboree, puma, Jordan, and so on. Lots of shoes. BUT everything was so ridiculously unorganized. The sizes were all mixed up not to mention the styles. Boy's and girls' clothes are kept separate but don't expect much more than that. I found a few cute things in the disarray and got them for a good price. \nMy poor review is highly influenced by their bathroom situation, good god. Firstly it's super dirty in there & smells like tu sabes que. They put a giant open trash can right under the changing table- gross. Speaking of the changing table, it's about to fall of the hinges. How can an establishment with a self proclaimed \""baby depot\"" have a death trap like that? I had to prop the table with my knee idk it was a mess. If you come here with your babe, change him somewhere else. \nMess mess mess."
"2","Have been here several times now and they are consistently great. They really do put the other place I used to go to to shame!  So glad to have found a place you can trust, who do a good job with great prices too."
"1","I would give zero stars if I could. After waiting in the drive-through for half an hour they told us they cannot take credit cards."
"1","Native  New Yorker in Tempe was OK, I had not been to this location in several years and was waiting for a friend that lives near this location. \n\nI know they are famous for their wings but I was not in the mood for them today so I got their Club wrap with fries and a coke. Along with some fried mushrooms. The total was 15 bucks which I thought was a bit expensive for the little bit of food I got, and I could of got the same thing pretty much that was bigger at subway for 7 bucks. Plus that the coke tasted watered down.\n\nEverything was served promptly and my service was good, the decor is cool definitely a good sports bar with TV's everywhere you look.\n\nI will say that the food was OK, but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords, the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else, but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice."
"1","Got my to go order back to my office and realized they shorted me half my order. Called and the little girl who answered wanted to argue and talk over me.  Told me there was nothing she could do.  I wouldn't go back if the food was free."
"2","Meh on the atmosphere.\nWHOA to the food.\n\nWent here on a Saturday night with a friend to grab some grub before going out. It was a nice night so I opted for outdoor seating. I did this after seeing the interior of the place. Per the name, I expected to see a place decked out in New York memroblia, photos, newspapers, jerseys, etc. but sadly it looked the inside of a Pizza Hut. Nothing exciting on the walls, just booths and tables. Although the space was big and the bar looked pretty stacked, I wasn't impressed with the inside.\n\nOn the back patio, which had iron tables and chairs with a bar playing the Giants game (there's the festivness I was looking for) we ordered a side of Honey BBQ and spicy honey mustard boneless wings. OH SWEET MERCY, they were good. I love me some boneless wings and they were killer. I drank the kool aid and I am now a believer of why this place is proud of their wings.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the California Clucker. Chibata bread, grilled chicken, bacon, a mayo of types, and avacado. Served with wide-cut steak fries, it was delish. THe bacon was a little too crispy for me, but the avacado was just smushy enough. I couldn't finish and saved half for a late night snack. Even hours later I was 100& satisfied. \n\nI'd go back here on a wing special night and just eat my little heart out."
"1","I have been here 4 times. The first time was great! The wait staff was friendly and the wings were great. However, the three times after that I had horrible wait staff, was ignored by the manager, and the food was lacking at best."
"1","I hate myself every time I wind up shopping here. Having to lock up my purse, indifferent staff, high prices....  plus they carry very little sterling and charge through the nose for what they do have."
"2","This is probably one of the best pharmacies in Tempe. I was going to the CVS on mill for a while but had a terrible experience there and they only had the medicines I needed every once in a while, so I ended up here. It's a bit farther up the road, but I don't mind, it's totally worth it. The staff is attentive and helpful, even greeting you when you walk in the door. Everything there is priced as average and the wait time at the pharmacy is relatively short. I was able to get what I needed in a timely manner without having to pay too much. I found some really awesome snacks while I was there too. Oh, and one of their guy pharmacists was really cute too (I think his name was jeremy or something like that?) Super awesome place to go. Great service all around. Totally my go-to from here on out."
"1","I really try to be understanding about food taking some time. I am very willing to wait for quality food. Its actually my tagline for yelp...however, this place takes too long to get my to go chow mein out, I mean...its chow mein! I order it because its quick.\n\nWouldn't be so bad if it were better, or I could get the guys behind the counter to give me duck sauce at least.\n\nBTW, what is it with Chinese places and duck sauce? They seem to act as if they have never heard of it, every time. Although it says 'duck sauce' right on it. If you only get it when you order duck, fine. Tell me that, I can accept limitations. Its just when there is a blank stare or, even better, a \""We don't have that\"" (when I can clearly see it) that annoys me.\n\nYou get a good amount of food, its pricey though, a drink and dish, not a combo, are over $10. Again, if it were better..."
"2","I've been going to Golden Eggroll for 18 years now and I've got to say.  I love the Kung Pao Chicken.  Still taste as good as it was then when I first went there.  Another favorite of mine is the Hot and Sour Soup, always cure a bad cold.  I recently introduce my neighbor to the place and he can't stop talking about the Orange Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice.  Now its on my to try list."
"2","Found this great place near my house! The dinning area is a little small but the food makes up for it! The staff was very friendly and pricing was not bad at all for the portions we were given. My husband and I both got a combo plate and each a small drink and it was only about $22. But they do have they same combos avialable for lunch special pricing. We will definitely be back!"
"1","General Tsos chicken is literally a little chicken with a huge puff of batter surrounding it"
"1","Recently my husband and I were on our way to an appointment, and in need of dinner and having about an hour to kill, we decided to try Casa Reynoso since we see it every time we shop at the Fry's grocery store located in the same strip.  I was interested to see if this family-owned place had decent Mexican food.  Having been raised on New Mexico-style Mexican food, I am always on the hunt for food that tastes like Grandma's.  \n\nCasa Reynoso was just ok.  The decor is dated and slightly dingey, but I never judge a restaurant on their decor, it is the service and food that matter, so let's get to that:\n\n-The service was decent.  The waitress seemed to be in a hurry and no one was smiling.  The place wasn't very busy, but we had to wait a while to get our drinks and small little basket of chips and cup of bland, watery salsa.   \n\n-The food quality was just ok.  Nothing outstanding in my book.  I ordered the taco, enchilada, and relleno combination plate with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were probably the best thing I ate there.  The beans had great flavor and not too much salt, and the rice was cooked perfectly, also with lots of flavor.  It's difficult mess up a standard fried beef taco, and the one I had was the same as any other taco you'll get on a combination plate at any Mexican place.  The relleno was also ok, but not a lot of flavor and too much egg.  The enchilada was your regular old cheese rolled into a tortilla and smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.  The sauce was absolutely disgusting and I ended up only eating a bite of the enchilada.  I will say that I appreciate that they didn't mask the blandness of the food by absolutely suffocating it in cheese.  The food was so mediocre that I don't even remember what my husband ordered, and he definitely didn't rave about it.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't jump to recommend this place to anyone.  The food is mediocre, the staff didn't seem to care, and honestly, we could have gone around the corner to Riva's and gotten better food at their drive-through.  \n\nOf course, I love to give second chances, and I would love to see more family-owned Mexican restaurants thrive in tempe.  A couple of other reviewers recommended the green chili and burritos.  I will have to try those next time, but I don't really have high expectations for this place and probably won't be going back any time soon."
"1","I hadn't brought anything to Apollo Cleaners for a long time, and now I remember why.   I brought in a wool blanket and the person I gave it to, wasn't sure they could clean it.  She told me they would call and let me know.   Weeks went by, they never called so I stopped by.  They gave it back to me on a hanger and wanted $18.    They may have pressed it, but it was hardly cleaned and THEY NEVER CALLED.\n\nIf you need cleaning, find another cleaner.   Poor customer service, questionable processes."
"1","The website boasts of an oil change in 30 minutes or less, so I stopped in because I'm in need of a quick oil change on my lunch break. Imagine my surprise when I was told an hour and a half when I walked in the door. \n\nWhat happened to 30 minutes or less? \n\nNow I've wasted half of my lunch hour getting here, no oil change and now I'm hangry (translation: hungry + angry). \n\nNext stop: jiffy lube! :)"
"1","1) check in ok, love the layout of hotel\n   price was high for what you get\n    what's a \""bed tax\""?  now we have to pay to sleep?\n   nice lobby with sunken 'living room' and fireplace\n   free coffee in the a.m.\n   free paper in the a.m. \n\n2) Room - dark, old, stuffy\n     entrance light so dim you can't see in the closet.\n    closet space is angled, maybe take some bathroom space and make closet bigger?\n     bathroom big and if you like chips while taking a shower or bath, look up and peel one off the ceiling (I wonder how much lead is in it\n      room was with a pool view and if you like to sleep with the window cracked open a bit at night - ask before going if there are many families booked, the kids will be at the pool until midnight and up at 7am, or running down the halls yelling or throwing rocks at each other! \n   \n3) Housekeeping staff were pleasant and working hard.  \n   \n4) restaurant staff- 1/2 were oblivious, 1/2 was excellent!\n    expensive for dinner; wine list extensive but not in stock except the house wine\n   breakfast buffet- dirty counters and plates, over crisp bacon that turned into bits, waffle station disasterous and messy (no one came by to clean up the mess), bring a sweatshirt or sweater, they have the a/c turned up, eggs are the powdered kind\n\nCooks and some of the staff looked burnt out like the bacon bits!\n\nThere's definitely a 'fiesta inn' your belly after eating breakfast!"
"1","My flight was cancelled and I was given a room here for free.  The staff was busy and trying to be efficient and we were tired.  We were given a room as far from the front desk as you can get and after having walked there, the room had not been cleaned, unmade beds and such.  We went back to the office and I asked for a complaint form, they didn't have any and they didn't know how to record a complaint.  They gave us a room closer and it only smelled dirty and there was only a small wad of hair in the shower.\nYuck!!@!!"
"1","This is a large facility with major conference facilities attached. The rooms are *VERY* dated and in serious need for maintenance work. The beds are OK, but the rest of the room is old, out of style, ... the bathrooms had plumbing issues. The airport shuttle was slow. They have a great location and the potential to be OK, but they do not even seen to be trying."
"2","Staff and Doctors were very nice and helpful.  I enjoyed the experience with choosing my frames.  I also enjoyed the frames they carried.  I am a guy that likes more of a sporty look and I loved that fact that they carried some nice Oakley frames.  I will definitely continue to be a patient of their's."
"2","This is my REI of  choice in the Valley.  Mostly due to its proximity.  But I have been coming to this location since I lived in the wilds of Northern AZ and would make my way into the valley on the occasional escape to socialize.  REI was my decompression chamber of sorts  before I hit the mall and then hit the town....\nFour years later I am back in AZ and actually living in Phoenix and this REI is my goto place to look for everything from quality outdoor gear or practictical quality clothing."
"1","Very rude sales person on the floor very rudely told my three year old child that riding the child's bike that was on display was not allowed and physically stopped her from doing so while myself and my husband were standing right there. She did not offer any assistance and rolled her eyes when I displayed my disapproval of her talking down to my child. Will not be returning to this location and possibly REI entirely."
"1","This place is great for last minute things when going out for a weekend adventure but it's not the size of the store or the selection they offer that bothers me about this location...it's the lack of customer service. I've been into this store multiple times and have never been acknowledged. No \""hello\"" or \""can I help you find something?\"" I've been in, looked for what I wanted, waited for assistance, and have walked out every time without making a purchase or speaking to an employee. That's not good customer service....anywhere."
"1","They don't allow parents to go in the room with the kids. Something about they want the kids to get \""comfortable\"" with them. What?????????????? Umm... no thanx!"
"2","This place is pretty good! It might be all manicures, but mine chipped in about 2 days. But, it's cheap and they do a good job. The manicure looked great and professional. My toes look awesome too, and those always last a long time! \nThe only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because they made me walk to an ATM to pay in cash when they do take credit cards, they just prefer cash. I didn't appreciate the inconvenience. \nAlso, the hot rocks were burning my arms and so I pulled away. The man doing the manicure sort of laughed at me and then ridiculed me for not \""speaking up\"" and telling me that I need to speak up about things. How about you just use less hot rocks? That's not the type of person I am to yell at people about things, sorry! \nThey didn't hurt me at all, which is rare for me, so that's definitely a bonus. But, I recommend not letting them do the callus treatment, it made my feet worse!"
"2","Nothing fancy- just a regular nail salon but I have had consistent experiences which I am a fan of. Starting going here with Groupon but will continue to go. I like getting gel manicures- they are quick, steady hands, and I am in and out within 30-60 minutes. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get pretty busy but you can also just walk in if you have some time to wait."
"1","I decided to try this place because they have a yelp coupon ($35 for $50) and it was open today on Easter.  When I walked in they told me that the coupon isn't valid on weekends (which wasn't specified on the coupon or website) but they decided to honor it regardless (+1 star). I was thankful that they honored the coupon but I was dissatisfied with the gel manicure. The man who did my gel pedicure was excellent (+1 star). My gel manicure was a disaster, first the lady had to re-do my right thumb 3 times because the gel Polish kept bubbling and sliding. Probably because she kept me seated at the pedicure station instead of moving me a to a table. And instead of fixing two other fingers on my left hand (they have a weird ridge going along the nail bed) she just left them (probably out of frustration). I didn't complain because at that point I have been there for a while and could tell she was just over fixing my manicure. My advice would be to skip this place for a gel manicure and get the guy to do your pedicure."
"2","Darryl the really tall manager, he's the best! I will comeback only because of his service and the attention to details. Cheap drinks and tacos... The pizzas are good but the tacos are amazing! Try the potato ones..."
"2","I found this dentist office through Yelp and the awesome reviews were spot on! :) Dr Amy and Kristen were great! \n\nDr Amy was so attentive and didn't try to \""sell\"" me on anything like other dentists in the past have. She has a genuine interest in your smile, health and helping you save money. Most \""new patient appointments\"" are simply the x-rays, poking and prodding but they did all of the exam PLUS the cleaning all at the same appointment. To me, this was awesome and made the most sense instead of just scheduling to come back yet again just for the cleaning which is what most other dentists have done in the past in my experience. \n\nIn addition, I was able to watch \""Friends\"" while getting my cleaning done with headphones on so I could zone out and not try to not make eye contact/have an awkward drooly conversation while they are in your mouth. Side note,  why is it that dentists want to ask you questions when they are all in your mouth? Ha!  :) That really helped take the ease off and made it a much more pleasant experience. \""Friends\"" makes everything better after all ;) I would highly recommend Dr Amy to everyone- super nice, professional and helpful.\n\nPS- See Dr Amy, told you I would write and happy to do so! Keep up the good work!"
"2","This is a good dive bar with friendly bartenders and good cheap food. If you blink you may drive past it. I come here once in a while when I am in the neighborhood and don't want to deal the Mill Ave phonies...."
"2","In addition to the name, which I love by the way, I really liked this place.  I went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers.  There were five of us, we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50.  Not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio.  They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare (nothing special, just your typical bar food), and they offer mini pitchers of beer (I love that).\n\nMy only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio.  It's just gross.  But, the patio is big enough that we just moved \""upwind\"" from the smokers and we were fine.  \n\nThis would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks.  I'll be back again."
"1","I went here for a friends birthday and must say that it will be the last time I ever go to Pranksters. Maybe I'm new to the bar scene, but having servers with attitudes and being bitchy to customers isn't my idea of a good time. My friend ordered a water, another friend ordered an iced tea, and I ordered a cider. It was hot outside, so it would be a nice break, right? Well 30 minutes later there is no sight of our waitress and no drinks. She finally comes out with an iced tea and walks away, but not before we flag her down. Turns out she forgot our orders even though she had the receipts. She did apologize, but it still took her 5 MORE minutes to bring a water and 10 minutes to bring a cider.  Another friend was trying to order and she completely ignored him. She didn't show up until closing time (2 hour later) to give us checks and shoo us all out. I went to use the bathroom on the way out and had a waitress look me straight in the eye and say \""UGH, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CLOSING TIME\"". I'm sure there are nicer waitresses working there and maybe they were just having a bad night, but that was more than I wanted to deal with and the WORST service I've ever gotten anywhere, period. I won't be going back."
"2","Connie and the rest of the staff were amazing! We didn't know exactly what we were looking for, but she walked us through all of our options, and the plaque came out looking fantastic. The price was great, the staff was very knowledgeable, and they really went the extra mile for us. When Connie found out this was a surprise gift, she even made sure to call my cell phone before emailing me any questions or proofs, just in case I wasn't the only one at my computer. I would recommend Tempe Trophy to everyone!"
"2","Really great little Breakfast/Lunch place tucked into one of the most industrial parts of Tempe.  You might not even know it was there were it not for a few covered tables on a make shift patio.  Really great food, super prices and almost disgustingly nice people who work there!  \n\nThe place is so cute.  Black and white checkered tiles.  White bead board up to a chair rail.  Very homey without being overly kitschy.  \n\nWhile they do all the basics, and do them well, this isn't just your basic fare.  How about their Muffelatta for $5.15?  Or their Hot Sweet Italian sandwich - with sausage, onion, peppers and mushrooms w/ melted provolone cheese ($5.85)?  And their Spinach salad with egg and bacon for $5.05?  All good.  They even have a Monte Cristo ($5.15) on their menu! And their basics are great.  I had the Tuna melt ($5.05) on an employee's recommendation and it's one of the best one's I've had in a long time.  I haven't had their breakfasts yet, but I've got my eye on their Egg, Chorizo and roasted green chile wrap for $3.25.  \n\nAnd then there are their drinks.  Sure - when I saw I could get Hires Root Beer or Squirt with my lunch, I was stoked.  But then I saw their coffee menu.  How about a large (32oz) Iced Coffee for $2.25? Or a large Iced Chai for $2.05???  They also Cappuccino, Espresso and Lattes for similarly great prices.  \n\nBut in the end, it's the folks who work there that have knocked me out. My first time there, the girl who took my order remembered my name and checked on me twice at my table - by name.  She wasn't a waitress, just worked behind the counter.  But when she came to clear a table, she just wanted to check on things.  \n\nI almost hate to give the place up, but the more folks who come by, the more likely I am to be able to keep this place around.  So I definitely encourage you to come by.  Even if it's to just grab a coffee and a baked good.  Yes - they bake things fresh on site every day.  Just one more layer of their oh so goodness.  If only they were open on Saturday...\n\nHours: M-F, 6am-3pm"
"2","Great service, such nice welcoming people. I had breakfast here and would love if they got a better syrup. The have that regular very thin semi sweet syrup and my plate would have been amazing if I had some aunt jemima or something. Would definitely go back! Wish this place was in California!"
"2","By far the best office max location I have been to. Always greeted and asked right away of I need help finding something, and when I tell them what I want they promptly tell me where it is. There is never a line, and so far they always have what I need"
"1","In a word...grody.\n\nThe second I walked in the door I was lambasted by a serious stank. It smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners. I should have done an about face at this time but I foolishly pressed on.\n\nI ordered the Red Devil white calzone, which was advertised as mozzarella, olive oil, fresh Roma tomatoes and garlic. The mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless, the tomatoes were mealy, underripe and were decidedly not Romas (likely Beefsteak or Mountain Pride). The garlic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull. \n\nI'm not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of Italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic. Mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and I love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too much.\n\nI will not be returning to this location. However it should be noted that I ate at the Pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent."
"1","I just sent the following message through their website.  I'll update when I receive a reply.  Only 2 stars because not a fan of sausage and lack of an on the spot appropriate response.\n\nJust picked up my pizza from your take out window at the Mill and Southern location.  Order #48, medium pepperoni and MUSHROOM order, and received a pepperoni and SAUSAGE pizza.\n\nOrder was placed by phone, employee name not given (or asked for), order repeated back correctly, but still the wrong toppings.\n\nWhen this was mentioned to the cashier, his reply was \""I did not take the order\""  and \""I can make another one\"".  Not sincere, did not look me in the eye.  I work and cannot wait the additional time for the correct order to be made.  Why not an offer to discount the one wrong topping?\n\nIt's going to be a long weekend of SAUSAGE.  Kind of dissapointing."
"2","This was my first time here and enjoyed the pizza and wings. There ranch dressing is very good. Also enjoyed the great customer service from the staff here at red devil"
"1","DON'T EVER GO HERE FOR ANYTHING!!! ITS TERRIBLE!! I got a regular oil change here and they broke something while doing that and didn't tell me. When I checked my car a couple days later I went back to complain and he finally admitted to me that he knew it was broken and he forgot to put it on my receipt!! What liars !!! AVOID This Place !!!"
"1","WORST PLACE EVER!!!  Make sure you pay before you go in otherwise they will change the quote and charge you more.  It was a good place, now that managment has changed, they are the biggest jerks ever.  And I only got an oil change. NEVER GO HERE!!!"
"2","There are several shared characteristics of a good dive bar:\n1. Cash only for cheap, stiff drinks.\n2. Pool tables (or alternately, shuffle board. darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.)\n3. Jukebox (classic rock required, the top 40 laughed out of the place.)\n4. An air of disrepair (rips in the booth upholstery, musty smell of smoke on the air- because despite the ban, it's already been cured into the wood.)\n\nThis place has all those things in spades.\n\nI hardly ever end up at the Time Out Lounge because I never carry cash, but the drinks are deliciously strong and don't strip your wallet of its greenery too quick. There's an ATM there too. The pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap, but if you're drinking by yourself, you're required to get the half pitcher. Apparently they can't serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting. What wacky laws.\n\nThere are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space, but if you're going during the rush, good luck securing one of them. I'm not that great at pool, but I really enjoy playing at this place (usually with a good partner I can coast off of and then gloat with after we win) because of the atmosphere. So don't be a hater. \n\nThere's a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox. My friend and I got our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of British expatriates in a game of cricket. But tall dark and handsome can beat me any day. It's all about the accent. Surprisingly, I've never used the jukebox. But I have heard wonderful tales of it from multiple people."
"2","One of my new favorite haunts. The good thing about living at Mill & Southern is a great bar selection within a block or so, OK so I'm into dive bars, it's almost heaven. The first time I went into the Timeout, it reminded me of a hundred bars back home in Pittsburgh. I didn't feel alot of personality the first couple times, not until I met and made some friends. It's a bar that plays pool, as you can see by all the trophy's and the bulletin board cluttered with league info. I'm a casual player so it's a little intimidating at first, but everyone there is great. That's the allure; the people. You can't look around and see it in the fixtures, it's the conversations, the eclectic hair, the young, the old, the ones with blue chalk wiped on their pants and spilling PBR as they giggle away. The bartenders are fun and easy on the eyes-Daddy Like!\nAND, last but not least, I dig the jukebox and the tunes that get downloaded, alot of punk, new wave and other tunes that I grew up loving."
"2","My heart is mostly hard, particularly in places where the arteries have closed and the ventricles seized around a blockage of unknown fatty matter.   I'm fairly certain that I will die before age 40, of some hard-hearted condition related to my perpetual consumption of fatty foods.   For this reason it is perhaps ironic that the one soft spot in my otherwise much-maligned heart is for hot dogs and burgers cooked over an open flame. \n\nIt's no surprise then that I'll be going back to Ted's.  Like a phillistine, I had a chesseburger but it was tasty.  The onion rings are also good, much more to my taste than traditional O-rings.   \n\nLong lines and no ranch makes for 4, rather than 5 stars.  But the staff was friendly, the food priced right and the ambiance fun and lively.  I definitely recommend Ted's."
"2","If you enjoy hot dogs, get to Ted's ASAP!\n\nTed's is a great place to have a charcoal grilled hot dog with all the sides.  There are other items on the menu (sandwiches, burgers), but I've always stuck with the staple hot dog and fries. One day I will try a burger and a milkshake.\n\nHard to beat Ted's classic meal of a hot dog, drink and either fries or onion rings.\n\nThis is a no frills place, good food, good service and old school charm.\n\nThe place can get very busy! Be prepared to wait in line and/or wait for a table to sit.\n\nI'm a bit ashamed that I never wrote a review of Ted's earlier. I thought I had and then realized I never did. Better late than never."
"1","Its a little too pricey for what it is. I got the chili dog meal and it was very heavy (not complaining) and very dry (complaining). My son got the regular hot dog...again over priced and its a regular hot dog. I'm sure the people who love it are the ones who just really DOCTOR IT UP WITH ALL THE TOPPINGS. Then maybe I could see you getting your moneys worth?"
"1","I heard so many great things about it, I stopped once with my family to find that they only took cash but didn't have an ATM in the lobby. So I went back when I was on my way to school to grab something and got a seriously bad stomach ache. \n\nVery disappointed"
"2","Very good hot dogs. These beauties are charcoal grilled so they have that authentic family picnic taste. I ordered a footlong chili cheese dog with the bun grilled and an order of onion rings. The hot dogs were great and the onion rings were dynamite. Everything is made in front of you, so no soggy dogs here! Whenever I'm back in this area, I'll be coming to Ted's."
"2","Why on earth would you go to McDonald's or Burger King when this place exists? The fries alone keep me coming back. My go to is the all beef with chili. Yeah, I might feel guilty and go to the gym after eating here, but I never feel like I just ate garbage. Fresh and made when you order it. Don't let the line scare you! They are quick and friendly."
"2","Yum.\n\nHaven't been here in, like, 20 years, but I can promise it won't take that long to go back. The dogs were perfect. I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but when I want one, I want one grilled and slightly charred. That's what I got.\n\nThe fries and onion strings were SO good. Hot and crispy and full of flavor. Not a lot of fancy anything, just your classic hot dog toppings, simple fries and onion rings (when you do it right you don't need to cover it up).\n\nThey also have burgers and shakes. Must try next time."
"2","I have never heard of $25 massages ($20 for first time customers).  I guess this is a clinic for students just how medical students practice in clinics as interns.  I recommend come here early in the morning because the place can get crowded very easily.  Its about 30 min to 1 hour wait.  The waiting room is a simple area, so I recommend coming with a friend to hang out, bring music, or bring a book.  The process is very simple, as your name will be called by a therapist.  The massage is about 50 minutes in a communal area.  That is the only negative is the privacy, but I guess you get what you"
"2","This was our second try at the Top of the Rock. To be honest there are a few reasons I cannot give this 5 stars, so lets start with that so I can end on a high note. \n\nFirst off, $5.00 for valet or you get to park down a steep hill and walk to the place. I think for the overall price point offering valet  to patrons should be free, of course tipping your valet when you leave. The other reason,  the decor of the place. It feels really dated, granted the view at sundown is amazing, but still there needs to be a little updating. Lastly, our server, she was very nice, and pleasant however she did offer us bread... OK, OK  maybe she did save our waistlines, but at the end of our meal we saw what looked like delicious rolls brought to another table and we all wondered why we not offered any, I mean hey, we get the option to be fatties, right? Side note, the servers also wore jeans....not a huge deal, but did not help the ambiance...\n\nNow on to the drinks, I had a prickly pear margarita, it was way too sweet for me (I should have known better so not issue there), the hubby had not one but two of their kiwi caipirinha's. I followed up with a regular Margarita on the rocks, it was decent.\n\nOK now the food. We started with the shrimp appetizer, we ordered two, one for each couple to split. They were grilled with honey and lime, and had house made potato gnocchi. There was a mixture of mission figs, chorizo and cheese that accompanied the shrimp. The dish was down right awesome. The flavors were very well balanced and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. We were all very impressed. \n\nEach of the four of us had our own main dish. I had the seasonal veggi dish. Lets just start off with the fact that yes, you can mess up vegetables, but these were great.  Artisan carrots, broccolini, asparagus, buttery pieces of brussle sprouts, pouched beets all over your choice of purple roasted potatoes, red quinoa, their specialty french fries, and their might have been another choice, but I got the quinoa. It was great, and  I am not a vegetarian BTW, but I wanted something lighter to eat (so dam hot out) and this was honestly good and filling. The husband had the chicken and dumplings which I had a bight of, it was a little salty for my pallet, but he sang its praise. It was made with gnocchi too. The other couple with us had the pork tenderloin which was melt in your mouth fantastic, and the pan-seared scallops. These scallops were huge!  I am totally picky about scallops, I only like em small, so I passed, but both my husband and the person who ordered the dish said they were great. \n\nFinally, desert. We were all honestly full, but I could not pass up the bread pudding. We all kind of split it. House made cinnamon ice cream with queen creek pears. We were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I do wish there was a better chocolate option on the menu, but that's OK I guess. \n\nOver all, I am looking forward to returning to Top of the Rock! The service, was great, the food was eclectic, gourmet and unexpected. I really enjoyed this place our second time around. Oh, the bill for five drinks, two apps, four dinners, two espressos, and a dessert was $190.00 (without tip)! That's a great deal in my book!"
"1","My husband and I recently stayed at the Buttes and were looking forward to a great dinner at Top of the Rock.  What a disappointment!  We dined on a Sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty (there were only 7 couples the entire night, including us) and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.  Perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work, as service was mediocre at best.  My husband ordered the beef short ribs, which was a fairly decent dish.  Unfortunately, I ordered the pork tenderloin.  The pork was so salty that I couldn't even finish it, and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.  We left without a single goodbye, feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.  If you're looking for a nice dinner, save your money and go to Kai or Ko'Sin at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Hotel!"
"1","Spa is tiny. Terrible.  You can hear someone urinate while in waiting room of locker area.  Sauna was 90 degree.  Massage rooms were located right off the main entrance of spa so you could hear all the ladies squawking while they were getting there nails done.  Neck rest broke while getting the massage...nobodies fault, didn't make for comfortable rest of massage though. \n\nAs for the hotel....service is slooowwww.  Rang the front desk and an average 15 rings before someone unapologetically picked up. One time 30 rings and another no one picked up.  The excuse was they were booked solid.  So!  Staff for it! Rooms were ok.  I'm a platinum Marriott member, I've been to a ton of hotels (travel for work) and many of them were Marriott resorts.  This one gets last place.  Even the house keeping was slow, we didn't get our room turned until 3pm.  Room service was good.  The only reason they received two stars from me,"
"1","Reserved room a week in advance and requested 11am early check in, is now 3:45pm and we've been waiting at the resort all day. Classic bad business: under delivering after over promising. The Grand just a few miles away seems like a much better option."
"2","Good, convenient, great prices"
"1","Rude and too much clutter!! Don't have any prices on braiding hair packages.  They charge a different price for braiding hair every time I shop here. I'm done! No more!"
"1","This nanny service is horrible.  When I signed up to use a nanny service, I expected it to actually decrease the stress of hiring a nanny.  It actually made the process 10 times MORE stressful and hectic.  They nanny candidates they sent me were inexperienced and uneducated.  Some of them couldn't even completely fill out the application.  What's more, most of the nannies they sent me didn't return my calls.  On top of that, the agency would only send me 2 names at a time, so rather than do a bunch of interviews all at once and get the process taken care of, it dragged on for week after stressful week. It got to the point that I began conducting Craigslist interviews in addition (I hired a private detective to run background checks if I found someone on Craigslist).   When I complained to them about the service, with the above complaints, they literally yelled at me for over 45 minutes about how I was probably just trying to get out of paying (not true - I never even asked for a discount).  They are not interested in you as a customer or your needs as a family.  Evidently, they know what is best for me and my family.  \n\nWhen I finally found a nanny through their service (in hindsight, the least bad of the terrible choices they'd sent me), I would up having to fire her before a year was over.  Their service is overpriced and literally completely worthless. STAY AWAY!!!!  I now have a nanny who I found through a personal connection, and have had her for 3 years.  Now that I know what a good nanny is, I can clearly say STAY AWAY FROM THE NANNY EXCHANGE."
"2","My favorite flower shop! On Fridays- they sell all their cut flowers for 1/2 price! \nThey've cut the hours and now close at 5:00 pm instead of 6:00 (sigh)\nVery nice people and great service. They have a wonderful assortment of beautiful flowers and potted plants. Small and local ! Highly recommended."
"2","I have used SMW for many years for routine maintenance on my a/c and heater.  I knew the unit was old, but for years they have been repairing it as needed, until finally they gave me the opinion that it needed to be replaced.  I had to wait a couple days for the scheduled replacement, and during that time the a/c died completely.  Scott came out to my house in the evening, just to see if there was anything he could do to get an extra day or two, but no luck.  They moved up my installation time, and there was no charge for the extra service visit.  I love my new unit and would never consider using any other company for my a/c needs."
"1","I've avoided Wal-Marts in big cities for years. Life is too short. But WM seems to be trying to upgrade its image, its stores, and the quality of the fresh foods in their Supercenters. So I gave this one a try. I got three or four items from the produce center (it was actually quite impressive), and headed to the 12 items or less lane. There were maybe a dozen people in that line in front of me. Sigh. Oh well.\n\nSo I stand there - checking my iPhone email - and it slowly dawns on me that someone is yelling. So I look up and I see the cashier of this line - a grizzled old lady shaking her bony finger - is screaming for me to get out of her line because she'd turned her light off. No joke - screaming! It took me a good five or six seconds to truly realize that this was actually happening, and happening to me. So I yelled back that someone as old as her should have better manners, that her light was on when I got in line, and that she should feel free to proceed straight to hell. I dropped my produce on the floor and walked straight out the door. Never again..."
"1","Seriously sketchy. Last time I was here cops had three people handcuffed lying in their stomachs. There are never any open registers. The produce is disgusting. Half of the parking lot lights are out, and if the people outside are anything like the people inside, I'd rather not be in the dark with them."
"2","I was recommended by a coworker and this place is great! Won't be going anywhere else! Not only do they do a great job on designs they don't make you feel uncomfortable for asking."
"1","I will never use another Pure Fitness gym again. This review isn't specific to this gym, but applies to all Pure Fitness locations. I posted this here because this is where the event took place. \n\nOriginally my dues for Pure were $19 a month which gave me access to all gyms, classes, etc. I decided to add on a personal trainer at a rate of $50 an hour. I would see the trainer about 1 to 2 times a week. Several months ago, Pure Fitness announced that they would start a new program where you would get a 30 minute training session every week if you raised your dues to $29 a month. Sounded like a great deal to me, so I signed up. The program was going great for about 2 months. At that point my trainer advised me that the program had grown so much that they are turning it into an hour long GROUP sessions. Basically you don't have an appointment, and you show up at the top of the hour during one of the scheduled group \""PFE\"" classes. You may or may not have the same trainer each time. Here's the thing. My dues stayed the same and Pure Fitness already offered group classes that were included with my membership when the dues were $19 a month. I tried the class once, but it wasn't the same as the 30 minutes one-on-one that got me to sign up for the \""Pure Fitness Experience\"" program. After wards they changed the schedule of the \""PFE\"" classes that I just said screw it. I canceled my membership at that point. My membership officially expires on Sunday, and I say good riddance."
"1","Stay FAR AWAY from this place.  Complete scammers.  My girlfriend brought here car in with a slow starting problem and said she thought it may be the starter.  Without running the simple diagnostic on it to confirm this was the problem, they replaced a perfectly good starter ($550 with labor)--it was only then that they proceeded to tell her that the battery was the real problem.  I asked the manager afterwards why they would not check the starter (which literally takes 5 seconds) and said he just does what the customer asks for and was obviously unwilling to refund any portion of the unnecessary work.  So unless you (or your wife, daughter, etc) are a licensed mechanic, do not use this garage.\n\nCOMPLETE AND TOTAL SCAM ARTISTS.  You would be better off taking your vehicle literally anywhere else."
"1","So wife and I went there.  I asked for cheese ravioli with non meat sauce.  Plate comes out with meat sauce.  Brought me a second plate started to eat it, and there was meat sauce on it again.  I believe the chef used the same serving spoon for both the meat and non meat sauce.  Which to a vegetarian is a big thing, I told that to the manager.   The manager was very nice and felt very sorry for us.  He ended up not charging us for anything but the glass of wine.  We both got a piece of pie.  \n\nWould probably go again, because my wife liked the pot roast; but I will be very careful what I order.  I don't know how much I trust the chef there.  Mixing serving spoons between meat and non meat items, is not ok IMO.  Mine is a personal choice, but some people eat this way due to other reasons which they consider to be very important.  \n\nVegetarian check your plates."
"2","I absolutely recommend this hospital to those looking for a forever vet.  \n\nGoing to the vet is scary especially when it involves a family member, but pecan grove is the right choice. \n\nI have already brought my rabbit and recently my dog here for treatment and the staff, vets, and vet techs have been amazing and so helpful. \n\nDr. Holmes has performed surgery on my rabbit (teeth removal and neutering).  He told me everything I needed to know beforehand and even promised that if he did not do the procedure properly he would not charge me for returning to do the procedure again.  He followed through and even called a couple days later to make sure everything was fine.  He works with a rabbit rescue and will give you a discount if you mention them. \n\nDr. Tuttle took care of my cutie pie. she was bit by some neighbor's dog and had an infection in her paw.  although cutie was a bit hesitant to treatment, Dr. Tuttle did not hurt her. She informed me of everything I needed to know to make sure that the wound would heal up properly. Cutie is also a new addition to my family and I know nothing about her. Dr. Tuttle made sure that I knew what types of vaccinations I needed to give her and also preventive care such as oral care, heart worm prevention, and boosters.  I asked a lot of questions concerning Cutie and she was patient and made sure all my worries were gone. \n\nBy the end of the appointments, I felt like I could go home and  take care of my pets in their time of need. \n\nThe facility is a bit small, but they are well equipped and even have their own pharmacy. \nAlthough I think the pricing of their services is a bit overpriced, you can be sure that you and your pet are getting the care and attention you're \npaying for.\n\nYou can visit their website at pecangrovevet.com or add them on facebook too."
"2","Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  I have been to most gyms in the Phoenix area (and Boston, for that matter), and Lifetime is definitely at the top.  I just convinced most of my family to join.  Has everything you need and then some!\n\nUpdate:  While I still love this place, the maintenance is quite lacking.  Pieces of equipment will be broken for over a month or more before they are fixed.  I am pretty diligent about reporting equipment that needs to be repaired/maintained, but apparently the staff at Lifetime is not so diligent about getting things fixed.  Very unfortunate, especially for a fitness center of this caliber and at the cost of the memberships."
"1","Really like the gym most of the time,  except for the Kid's Club.  If you have kids younger than school age,  this gym is not for you.  They have a time limit... which they don't bother to mention prior to getting you to join.  Then if you \""go over\"" 3 times,  your membership is suspended.   I have not even been able to go over to the weight lifting section of the gym after 3 weeks of membership - thanks to the kids club.   Also, have to leave classes early which is disruptive i.e. in yoga..... again.. thanks to kids club.  The girls who work there are snotty and make snide remarks if you are even a couple of minutes late.    I have written a letter to \""corporate\"", but I am told that I will never get a response.   So.... once again... as a single working mother with child... I feel that I am paying more than the average person to work out there.. plus I am not able to work out as long as other people who pay less.   Completely frustrating.   I signed up for 800.00 worth of Summer Kids Camps...which I have subsequently withdrawn from due to the bad attitude of the Kid's Club employees.   So.. if you don't have kids... the gym would be great."
"2","Big fan of this gym. I love it! Very clean!"
"1","Beware of this gym!!! I put my membership on hold because of an injury and they said I still owe them money. I finally said OK and went into pay and canceled my account. I received an email for another bill that was still owe. They told me I didn't sign something. I said the employee never ask me to sign something. Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE!!!! I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense."
"2","I have been a lifetime member for years now and I know what to expect from lifetime... that would be excellence in a gym.  The gym has everything you need, pool, fitness classes, plenty of machines and a weight area.  The location is clean and is located close to the freeway.  The only downfall to lifetime is the amount of members.  There are sometimes too many people there to feel comfortable when working out."
"1","Horrible experience!!! For the past 20yrs, I've always belonged to a gym. This was the worst, ever! I started by signing up with a personal trainer (he was awesome) however, I ended up having major hand surgery on both hands and was unable to finish my last 4 sessions. After many attempts to speak to someone and I'm talking weeks for someone to get back with me. LTF refused to reimburse me for he last 4 sessions! \nI also feel like $120 a month for a single person is way over the limit, especially for a gym that has out dated equipment. \nI belonged to Lowes YMCA ($65 a month) and that gym makes LTF look like a dump!"
"1","I was really excited about finding a gym that also offered a complete health and weight loss program. But so far I have been extremely disappointed with it. Everything that you get for free with your \""LT Bucks\"" turned into an hour of wasted time for me. No real information or counseling provided, just a sales pitch to try and get you to sign up for some weekly meeting with the trainer or nutritionist that is going to cost you 100 bucks an hour. And they really put the pressure on to try and convince you that you need all these tests - metabolic rate, food allergies, cortisol levels. And each one costs hundreds of dollars. Their strategy should be to educate those of us who generally want to learn about how to have a healthier lifestyle. Then we'd be even more loyal to Lifetime and they'd make their money back tenfold over time from the $55 monthly membership fee. And only push the extras if it is genuinely needed for that individual. Instead they all just seem like used car salesmen and it almost turned me off from the whole place.\n\nFor now I am just trying to push all that noise aside and focus on just the gym, which is actually pretty nice. They have a wide variety of equipment and there is never any wait. My biggest complaint is that their group fitness classes are insanely crowded. I actually saw one girl get knocked to the ground in Zumba class last week because it was just too packed in there. Seriously!"
"2","I thought it was time to write about the amazing facial I had at Life Spa with Bethany. \n\nMy skin felt great from all the wonderful products, my shoulders and scalp felt great from the awesome massage, and my wallet felt great from using my new member ticket!\n\nEveryone was very kind and professional -- from the girl that greeted me to Bethany to the girl at the front desk who asked me how everything went. \n\nTwo things I thought were really great:\n1) Life Spa doesn't use bottled water. They instead offer you filtered water in a real glass. I dislike those mini bottled waters and I think they taste worst than filtered water. \n\n2) My scalp massage. My brain felt like it was on vacation for the entire facial. So relaxing and so wonderful."
"2","I've had a massage and a pedicure here, both of which were great. Prices are a bit high for regular visits (used a new member discount), but if you're willing to pay over $30 for a pedicure, it may be worth it. Pedicure area has 1 chair and the technician is not full time, so although the experience is a private and quiet one, you'll definitely want to call ahead of time and schedule an appointment. Very serene and relaxing environment (you forget you're in the middle of a large gym), and the staff is very friendly and attentive."
"2","I love this Olive Garden!"
"2","We had a lunch in this wonderful place. I was very happy with services, very tasty food, comfortable interior...sooo I'm going to back soon:) thank you ! Love Italian food!"
"2","This place blew our expectations out of the water! On our trip to ikea tonight, my husband and I were planning to go to Genghis grill since it was nearby but they were closed. I found YC'S on yelp and it had good reviews. My husband was leary when we first walked in because there was no one at the counter. The super nice waitress/hostess was helping a couple of first timers (like us) with their selections. She was very nice and showed us the ropes and even mixed the sauce up for me. The portions were HUGE! My husband who usually can eat his full meal had to throw in the towel halfway because it was too much food. We both have hearty lunch portions to take to work tomorrow. The soup bar was excellent especially the wontons. For only $23 they provide you such a great 3 course meal. They even had swirl cones for dessert. The hostess made sure we enjoyed our meal the whole time and even let us have free to go boxes since it was our first time. She even threw in a small box so I could take wonton chips. The customer service was excellent and the food was fantastic. I definitely recommend this location!!!!"
"2","We've gone to this place a couple of times and haven't been dissatisfied once. The overall joy of YCs is getting to fill your bowl a mile high with pure gluttony. The selection of ingredients was right on, the quality could leave some yearning but this is definitely a Quantity over quality establishment. No complaints on that part because I still found the food to be flavorful and fulfilling. The free ice cream at the end is a sweet added bonus and much appreciated.  I look forward to going here when I don't feel like cooking and like the experience of abundant selections and flavor options. Recommended highly:-)"
"2","I love this place.  So refreshing, like eating snow."
"2","My family loves Christ Life Church. Excellent kidz programming, incredible live  modern worship, and relevant messages of inspiration and hope!"
"2","I drove from Mesa just to visit this place after multiple friends raved about the nail art. Sure enough they had a million different options for nail art. I payed $33 for pedicure calluse removal and argyle nail art. The girl who did mine was very sweet and did a great job she made small talk but allowed me to relax as well. I also payed $25 for a gel no-chip manicure. I was less than impressed with it, she did an ok job but the polish job was mediocre, she soaked my hands for a minute, did a quick file, and a very fast cuticle treatment and that was it. I expected a little more but I do think the gel polish will last, ultimately that's what I was looking for.."
"1","QUALITY NAILS IS NOT\n\nQUALITY NAILS IS NOT.  \n\nI patronized this shop on a Saturday afternoon WITH AN APPOINTMENT.  The shop was busy with bookings and continued to take walk-ins.  The techs RUSHED thru my pedi and fill.  As a result the DESIGNS ARE SLOPPY AND AMATUERISH looking.  This is especially annoying since it was the owner, Lisa, who did my fill.  She got up at least 4 times and was so distracted that she over looked bubbles and a lump in the gel polish.  I'm very disappointed in this shop since it was recommended to me because of their expertise in designs and nail art.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when I discussed the issues with Lisa today she didn't see anything wrong with the end product. While we were discussing how the price for my services was calculated we discovered she OVERCHARGED ME AT LEAST $5.  In the end Lisa grudgingly refunded $15 to me.  I' still think I was overcharged and their customer service is the pits.  \n\nIf there was a way to give a negative score to a business I certainly would give them a negative 5 stars!!!!!"
"2","I love this place ! I have been going to this nail salon for 5 years in Az. I moved to Cali and visit AZ often. When I visit I always get my nails done here! THEY DO A FABULOUS JOB AND i wish they came to California and open a shop! I get the most fabulous designs and they do an amazing job. I typically will get a full set and pedicure and its always amazing! Highly recommend!!!!"
"1","Reluctantly!!! We just ordered pizza and chicken wings from Rosati's, Tempe. The last pizza was HORRIBLE!!! We thought we'd give 1 last try because we had some box tops for half off? We noticed we had a missed call from Rosati's? We thought it was to confirm our order. But it was a rude guy claiming his name was Scott claiming he was the owner and how did we collect 10 box tops?  We told him, \""by buying pizza?\"" He was rude and sounded like a drunk from the hood? Maybe this guy is having money problems or something? Do yourself a favor and AVOID SCOTT and all locations of Rosati's Pizza as this Scott guy was very unprofessional and If he is the owner we suggest he spend his time at AA, trying to make pizza,  and trying to get his customer service up to par from a ZERO! If we could give Rosati's a ZERO STAR we would!"
"2","I went here to get my prom dress tailored a few days before my prom and they did a great job with it! The price was pretty reasonable for the alteration too, nothing crazy."
"1","This location is CLOSED. It's an empty building.\n\nI am only putting one star up because I have to in order to post."
"1","We tried Marcello's while visiting from out of town. Service was very friendly, though somewhat slow, and the decor and music were nice. We got the calamari as an appetizer, and it was a little bland. There also were a few pieces of metal on the plate- not sure where they came from, but fortunately we didn't eat them. My husband had the pizza, which he said was wonderful. I ordered the spinach ravioli with marinara sauce. The food took a while to come out of the kitchen, which was surprising as there were not many people in the restaurant. When my ravioli arrived, it was made with the wrong sauce. They quickly got a new order out, but the pasta wasn't fully cooked.\n\nEven if we weren't out-of-towners, we wouldn't eat here again. Too bad, because I was really looking for pasta."
"2","I actually found this guy on Yelp.  I purchased some sandals last fall on sale, and unfortunately, I needed some extra holes punched in to them because they were hurting my feet.  I had tried to exchange them at the store, but because it had been so long, I was unable to do so.  I was encouraged by the store to find a local shoe store to just get holes punched into the straps to accomidate my situatation.\n\nSo, I find this guy on Yelp.  I called in advance to see if he would be able to help me.  He said he could, and that he was open until 3.  So, I race over there, and he punched the holes in my sandals while I waited!  wooohoo! I was so grateful!\n\nHe charged me 50 cents a whole, times 4 holes for a whole $2!  This is great! \n\nThe store itself is small, but organized and rather clean.  They sell all kinds of shoe stuff, and do all kinds of repairs not only just to shoes, but luggage, zippers, etc.  He says he's been in business for 16 years now, and to keep coming back.  Good experience for something so simple and mondane."
"1","Don't bother calling the \""local\"" Sears number if you are looking for lawnmower parts.  You get routed to a call center in Bangladesh, or New Delhi ..   Not sure ... who are nice enough - but provide useless information about what they have in their warehouse in Toronto."
"1","This review is for the gas station. \n\nThe fuel pumps SUCK. Good luck holding the nozzle the whole time while your 40gallon tank fills up. Boo."
"2","We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms."
"2","Everyone there knows us. Everyone there knows Zoey, our Great Dane.  Everyone is amazing! Which is why we continually drive 30 minutes to go to a Petsmart, so we can get the daycare we know is best for our girl.  Trust me, if I didn't feel safe with her there, or if I felt the people didn't love her, we'd go somewhere else.  But they're fantastic so no worries.  : )"
"2","We attended for Gilbert Yoga Days. \n\nIt was only a short class, but it was a lot of fun. Decent work out and I felt great afterwards.\n\nAnd the people were awesome!"
"2","Authentic...  I know when I need to practice without all the extras.  Gilbert Yoga is where I want to unroll my mat.  They are passionate about sharing yoga with the community and it reflects through their teachers and studio.  They are creating a true space for us to find the essence of yoga."
"2","We frequent this place because we can walk there. The servers always remember my kids, this place is kid friendly. They remember us too when we leave the kids home and go to the bar (I know, parent of the year). The wings are good, my kids love the mozzarella sticks and pizza. They have karaoke some nights. They have a magic guy some nights. It's They have TV's for the sports.  Good enough for me. I can always find Brenden there!  Hey Brenden, your wife is lookin' for ya."
"1","Sorry to burst your bubble but this is a chain restaurant. I am from NY and I  have ate at Native New Yorker, and there food tastes nothing like NYC food at all. If your looking for real NY food usually the Mom & Pop Italian Restaurants are the best."
"1","It's a tradition in my family that the birthday person gets to pick a movie and we all go see it. Not wanting to deal with the holiday crowds, I foolishly said \""Let's go to the theater in Gilbert! It was always really nice, and busy but not nearly as hectic.\""\n\nAnd it was. Was being the operative word. Hectic? It's a ghost town. And it's not hard to see why. The seats are torn and filthy, I literally got stuck to the floor, the popcorn was stale and inedible, and the whole place now has the pallor of a business circling the drain.\n\nDuring our delightful visit to this \""premium theater experience\"" in a \""clean, convenient and modern theater\"" (that's Hollywood Theaters' promise, anyway), I could barely suppress my urge to leave and my brother couldn't suppress the urge to give me crap about it. Speakers were blown, the picture was lousy, I felt like I needed to bathe in bleach afterward... We should have just braved the Harkins at Chandler Fashion Center.\n\nWhile I practically lived here for several years, ain't no way I'm going back after my last experience."
"1","I always want to like Panda Express. They're friendly, nice establishment, conveniently located- but the food always leaves me disappointed"
"2","Best Chinese take-out in Gilbert! We've tried quite a few but none as good as this one! Customer service is always great every time!"
"2","I've been going here for years as a coupon oil change customer out of convenience. Over that time, I have gradually used them more and more with great reason. Very professional, great work, willing to explain repairs to those who aren't car savvy (I've overheard them doing this, was very impressed), etc. They've finally done a full conversion on me, one of my vehicles is pretty much totally covered there (alignments, brakes, tires). They are now my shop of choice!"
"1","Terrible. I called at 11 am and was told my car was ready. I show up at 1 pm and learn my car is not ready... Need another hour.  I had to get a ride twice. Wasting valuable time going to this place."
"1","Went in for a perm and the people were very rude. It is in a hidden out of the way location. Maybe the chain headquarters put it there on purpose. Hide the worst people in an area where no one will visit!"
"1","Sitting in the drive thru long enough to write a review. First I waited long enough that by the time I got up to the box to order bfast was over. Since I have ordered I have been waiting.. At the box......  For 9 min!!! If you are not ready to serve lunch then serve what you got! Still have not moved by the way"
"2","I am fan. We finally went here after many years of just driving by. It is not very impressive by the look of it, but the food is really good. Order the Posada items, they are really yummy. The service is good. the salsa is really good. We will go back again. The price is right."
"2","My family has been using Dr. Burke for our pets since I was to young to remember. He has a great personality, is very knowledgeable and is great with the pets! His prices are fair and you can usually get an appointment within a week or sooner for emergencies. The offices are always clean, bright and the front desk staff is very friendly. We have brought Dogs, Cats and Birds to Dr. Burke."
"2","This is one of my favorite Mexican fast food restaurants. It's clean and cool in the summer. It's neal the theater and my house. You can alway ask for more meat without extra charge. Of course, they will charge you if you ask two spoun more. :-)\n\nThe parking space is not as big as the store and it's crowed over the weekend."
"1","I really dislike this entire chain.  I have eaten a few and have not been impressed.  They make these burritos look huge by packing them in flavorless overcooked rice then put a few ingredients on.  They have additional items that you can buy a la carte to put on your burrito to add flavor, but you'd think they would be included.  This is Tex-Mex cafeteria food."
"2","Having lived in the NY & NJ area for 30 years I've become spoiled with good Chinese food. Last night my girlfriend and I decided to try this place in Gilbert. The menu was extensive and the prices looked great. We were shocked when I went to pick it up as to the large portions . The General Chicken was soft and not over cooked and the potstickers were hot and tasty. \nDefinitely the best Chinese Food I've tasted since I've been here. I can't wait to order again!!!"
"1","Gary M on 6/1/2013 said it all.  Been going to this place for years.  The place gets dirtier and dirtier.  Less attention to detail.  The acoustics are awful.  It's very loud and you have to yell to be heard.  The food isn't prepared properly and all they do is raise their prices.  You like wings?  well..if you want something other than your typical mild, medium, hot, they charge you an extra dollar.  You want just paddles or drums?..yup, an extra $1.50.  You want a side of hot sauce?..yup..that's another $1.00.  When you leave, you've paid $1.50 for each WING...\n\nGo to Native New Yorker!!!  Get 'em YOUR way and they don't break the bank.\n\nOh, Robert Irvine needs to intervene here.  (Restaurant Impossible)"
"2","This place is great. I like the laid back atmosphere and the fact that the offer groupons and deals frequently. The food has always been good, the drinks are gigantic (which is great because I like a lot to drink with my meals), and the service is always pleasant and consistent. My only complaint is that sometimes it's way too loud and I can barely have a conversation with my boyfriend across the table. The place is family friendly so there's always a lot of kids screaming/crying/dropping things and the TVs when football is on are sometimes loud."
"1","We just moved here from the Midwest and have been staying with my daughter in her apartment in Mesa while we wait to move into our house. I was recommend by a friend who knew the receptionist that worked there. \n\nWe have a 21 month old pure bred collie who just had all his shots before we came to this area! He caught a virus from the dog park at the apartment complex. They never called me back with his fecal exam test results! I paid at the time of our dogs appoint for prescription dog food and two prescriptions for him. I got for prescription at the appointment. They said they would call me when the prescription dog food and the second prescription came into their office for me to come and pick up. They never called! I called. I went and picked up the dog food. Five days later the second RX still never came in and still no phone calls from them even though I was calling them . Finally, I called and asked for my money back from the second RX that I never received. They even sent me a postcard saying my collie need his shots after I gave them his records from our vet back home. We found another Vet in Chandler who we are much happier with who calls us back, has the prescriptions in stock. Gilbert Veterninary Hospital called me and wanted to know if I had requested them to get my pets records from their clinic. I just told them yes? You would think they would get a clue on how they treated me and my pet! Some people really treat their animals as part of their families and you don't take their care lightly! I'm glad this wasn't a child but it was my child with four furry paws! I think that are out just to make money here and just want to rack on the charges! The other vet also told me my Rocky could keep getting this and told me how to prevent it. Where Gilbert was telling me if it happened again that it would require additional testing and was probably colitis! I found out the virus was going around between the other dogs in the apartment complex!"
"1","Target has a promotion they call Holly Jolly Savings.  It is promoted as spend $50 on Holiday items and get $10 off at the register. Sounds easy enough!  I fill my shopping cart with holiday Items and get to the check out..  My total was $171.80.  I showed the cashier my coupon, she scanned it  and told me my purchases did not qualify.  Really?,.....I ask how much more do I need to spend to qualify?  She does not have a clue but suggested I inquire at the customer service desk.  I go to the customer service desk and the clerk also has no clue to how the promotion works, but he was somehow sure I did not qualify.  I told him I would no longer be shopping at Target and he smiled and wished me a good day.  Officially added Target to my do not shop there anymore list along with Sears and Kmart..  I added a star as they have incredible shopping carts."
"2","This place is a gem. The Butter Bars are the best ever, not too rich so it makes your stomach ill, but perfect taste and 10 miles after i left wished i would have gotten more. Chocolate filled was best ever too."
"1","We have been taking our Yorkie to Caspers for many years.  The owner always seemed kind until today.  My husband picked her up after an unusually long time to find a shoulder puncture wound and a large, full thickness open wound to her front leg.  The owner lacked compassion and remorse for what had happened.  I have never seen such cruelty first hand and her lack of caring not just about my 16 year old dog but about her reputation as a groomer speaks volumes.  I had a $100.00 vet bill not to mention the suffering of my little dog after going to Caspers pet grooming.  The vet said they haven't seen a grooming injury this bad.  My little dog has 5 staples to her leg and dermabond to mend the shoulder laceration.  It's really sad for our family, especially out little kids to see and cannot understand such cruelty.  I would not recommend this groomer.  She never even said she felt bad. Now I know why this visit took so long, she had to wait for the bleeding to stop before she called us to pick her up. Horrible!!!"
"1","Finally shampooed the dog myself. FYI Casper's, she does not have any naturally yellow fur- it's as white a new fallen snow and very shiny now. I have told everyone how you lied to me about shampooing my dog,and I will continue to let people know about your dishonest practice."
"2","First impression... Neat, clean, nice and welcoming! Let's face it, I'm a chick so I'm quit hesitant to get anything done on my truck. But I literally was welcomed with a wave, a smile and a warm greeting. I pulled in about 5 minutes ago for an oil change and it already looks like their halfway done! I will definitely be back and I'm going to tell my husband about this place as well! He's going to be so jealous! ;  ) good job Brake Masters!"
"1","This place was not great.  They weren't busy so I got in right away, but that's about it.  The towels used were dingy and had holes in them.  The place looked and felt dirty. When the guy was cleaning my toes, he would wipe his tools on my feet instead of the towel. I wasn't impressed and will continue looking for a good spot near my house (have a great one near my office)."
"2","I've been going here since I was 12. I practically grew up here. There was a patch of time where it lost a lot of popularity. But great skate is back now. Filled with people every Friday and Saturday. The best lighting system, the best employees, the funnest environment and DEFINITELY the best sound system in arizona. If you're looking an awesome place to go with the fam or for bday parties, or even with your friends, go to Great Skate. You won't be disappointed."
"1","So me and some  friend went to this I hop today. I have the worst service I have ever had in my life. My friend had to wait about 20 more minutes for his food to come while we had ours ready. I had to remind the waiter that there was still an order missing. He brought it right away so we could tell it had been ready all along. He just forgot it. He didn't ask my other friend what kind of sauce she would like for her chicken. He didn't bring us syrup for our pancakes until much later. It felt like he wasn't all there. The wrost thing that happened was he didn't let us pay at the front so we could all split our tabs. Because of this,  he confused our payments and i ended up paying more than i should have. He was unprofessional and seemed like it was his first day at the job. I think he shouldve comped one of the meals to make up for the mistakes. Me and my friends are not satisfied with that waiter and it has made us not want to go to that location anymore."
"2","As others have suggested, the green chili is fantastic.  It really is the best.  \n\nTheir beans are very good too.  Not too salty like other places.  \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with their tacos though.  It wasn't bad, just that I've had better.  When I go back (and I will be back!) I'll pass on the tacos, but that just leaves more room for green chili burros."
"2","It's a small place with a large amount of flavor.  I've eaten here twice and loved it both times.  The soups are great and full of flavor.  Be careful when saying how hot you want it, I tried medium and it had some kick."
"1","This place has a hefty grey haired man with quite the crappy attitude.With his Horrible customer service skills, it's no wonder he's stuck working in this tiny gun shop crammed in the corner of the tiniest strip mall. Just went in on a whim, to ask a question about a particular rifle, and he acted like a complete DICK. I felt very uninvited in the store, and wouldn't spend a dime in this place nor 10 seconds of my time."
"1","Maureen was much too forward for my tastes I didn't want to go home with someone with that much red dye in their hair. I was flattered though. The bathrooms should have had drains on the floor, because that was where every one was urinating on. Most of the patrons look like ZZ Top roadies (and I don't say that in a good way). One patron was complaining about the \""baby\"" cucarachas in her ice - at least her's were babies. All things considered this is by far the best bar in Glendale AZ."
"1","I have been in this store  several times and have usually found the staff to be very arrogant and condescending. Also, needed to price some case lots of ammo and thought that I could do better elsewhere, for example, United Nations Ammo Co. who actually acts like they appreciates my business."
"2","I had this just yesterday. It was late at night and we were craving Chinese food but didn't want the typical Panda Express. So, I asked Siri to find me a Chinese place and because of the 4 stars we decided to give it a shot. The food was delicious! It was brought out in a timely manner and the staff was very nice! Overall we are definitely going back. :)"
"1","VERY poor customer service, Only reason i am using them and stuck using them is the fact that it is very close to my house and it was such short notice that i needed one, prior to renting my unit I tried to go there twice, both times they were on lunch break, a third time i went there and they were closed (even though their hours online said they should of been opened) and I had to do it through the kiosk which the people i spoke too were not very helpful at all, \n\nSo I get in, and I'm about to move my stuff when the storage unit I had just rented already has a lock on it and is rented apparently, I took it upon my own hands to take the one that was next too it being there was no lock and nothing in there, they still have not fixed it on my account after, calling them and letting them know they've messed up and need to fix my number so they don't screw me over, just emailed them about it again, \n\nThrough out all the problems, the worst was the fact that since i reserved the unit online there was a promotion first 3 months would be 50% off (which is why i did not want to get the unit via kiosk because they wouldn't honor it) the property manager Christine said she would give me first month free and second 50% off, basically ripping me off because the first month is free for everyon"
"1","Went time hungry howies because i was craving their garlic crust pizza. Got home and my pizza had regular crust! So pissed. Would've went somewhere else with better pizza in general if I wanted regular crust. Also, the guy who took my call rang us up for the wrong price. Got there and the other guy noticed and took 5$ off. I dont like a lot of sauce, but my pizza literally tasted like there wasnt any sauce on it at all. My boyfriend asked for extra sauce on his pizza and he said it didnt seem like they put any extra on. \n\nNever had a pizza messed up anywhere before last night. I hope they figure this out because I like hungry howies."
"1","I've been here twice to check out the facility.  Each time as soon as the door opens, I'm blown away by the overwhelming smell of urine and explosive diarrhea.  This entire place needs to be doused in bleach.  The staff is terrible.  I can't put enough emphasis on \""terrible\""  they are rude, they don't care and if they treated me that way, I can only imagine how they treat their patients when no one is looking.  There is one nice person that works here, Deshawn, she is the receptionist at the front desk and a total sweetheart.\n\nThis is the third Life Care Center in Phoenix that I've encountered.  They are ALL terrible rehabilitation facilities, they all smell the same and have the same careless staff.  If you care about your loved one that needs to recover from a surgery, DO NOT put them in a Life Care Center."
"1","My wife and I waited for a while to be seated despite several tables being open and cleaned. The regulars, who came in several minutes after us, are catered to by the staff (several parties were seated as we were but their tables had chips and salsa already waiting and they received their service at the same time we did). The food itself was good but lacked spice. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either. It is just an OK place to eat. Next time we'll drive a few more miles."
"1","I wish I could give negative stars. I went their twice, once for a consultation and the second time for my surgery, and they were rude to me from the second I walked up to the counter. Whoever makes the appointments sent me to the wrong place, telling me that my appointment was for my old location. I had my consultation to have my wisdom teeth removed, while they were talking to me, they were condescending, talking to me like I was a 5 year old. Three weeks later we were contacted to schedule my surgery, I went and waited for 3 hours for them to pull me back into the office saying they were out of anesthetics. When we asked if they would contact my insurance or schedule a new appointment we were told to do it because \""that is not MY problem\"" by the women in the office. We later found out that they never did contact my insurance, so that would have been a $900 bill for me."
"1","Ok so me and my son went, and some long haired \nIndian fool gave me a bunch of attitude about using \nThe bathroom, We had just finished some yard work and \nWanted to wash up before we ordered but the kid made a \nBig deal out of ordering first. Never again."
"2","I was in this place this morning and had to write a review despite not going very often because I was so pleased with my experience. I only go about every 6 months because its next to my dentists office so therefor its reasonable they have new management or staff every few times. \n\nThis time i'm pretty sure the entire staff was new, it was very busy for breakfast but quickly died down because they had a really nice system going where they were able to take orders and prepare them in a timely fashion.\n\nHowever I was especially pleased with the graciousness of all the employees, every one I encountered from the man who took my order to the lady who prepared my food and the man who rang me out was very friendly. All of them asked how I was doing and wished me a Happy Thanksgiving. Its that small amount of human interaction with genuine people that make for a great establishment. \n\nLastly as always my food was great, the bagels never disappoint."
"2","Great hospital the nurses were the best.  Our daughter was born here recently and we have no complaints.  I do wish the Mongolian BBQ that is offered in the cafeteria was better though.  It was prepared with the thinnest single slice of lunch meat chicken and then after a few bites I found it so unappetizing that I just threw it away.  But you don't go to a hospital for the food, and that's why I rate it five stars."
"1","In the past, I have dealt with Dr. Ganesh and Dr. MacCollum, both of whom were very good, professional, respectful and courteous. The one star is not for them, but rather for my most recent visits. \nMy son was seen by Dr. Morris twice for excruciating pain in his feet. She took a set of xrays both times and ordered an MRI the second time. The MRI was a long time coming and I couldn't wait to get the results. Here's where the one star part comes in.\nI received a call from Dr. Morris' assistant who advised they had received the results of his MRI and asked if I would like to schedule an appointment to go over them with Dr. Morris. At this point, I had already figured out what was wrong with my son, but wanted to double check the MRI was negative just to ensure what we thought was the cause was actually the cause. I explained this to the assistant who informed me, \""Dr. Morris does not give MRI results over the phone because it is a HIPAA violation.\"" The problem with this is that I work in the healthcare field and I know for a fact this is not true. I ended the call and called back after I had a chance to think about this and asked the front office girl to speak to a supervisor. She advised she would pass my information on to the supervisor but asked what it was regarding. I advised her I would like to talk to the supervisor regarding this incident. Because if it is just the doctor's policy, that's one thing; however, it is not now, nor has it ever been a HIPAA violation to give lab results over the phone. She stated, \""Yes it is.\"" I laughed and told her, \""Now I really need to talk to your supervisor because, clearly, your office is misinformed and I'm not going to pay another copay or have my insurance pay for another visit just to be told, again, that she doesn't see anything. If your supervisor would like to show me exactly where, in the law, it states this, I'll be glad to come in at that time; however, I am sure this is wrong and if your office is telling people this just to get them in the door again, that's not clinically appropriate.\"" \nShe advised she would pass my information to the supervisor who would call me back.\nI received a call from the supervisor who, apparently, has never had training in customer service in her entire life because she was the rudest, most incapable \""supervisor\"" I have ever had the unpleasant experience of speaking to EVER.\nI answered the phone and she introduced herself and said she was told I would like to speak to her. I told her I had taken my son there and recently had an MRI for which their office has the results. I further stated I had received a call from the assistant who told me he could not give me the results due to HIPAA law. I told her I am not wanting to take time off work, take my son out of school and go all the way down there again when I have already been there three times, for the doctor to scratch her head and tell me she still doesn't know. I advised I think I figured out what the problem is and that if she would just be so kind as to tell me whether she sees something or it's negative, I can go from there. But, I don't want to go there again if there is nothing to discuss. \nThe supervisor then told me, \""Okay, well, first of all, you've only been here twice. (Whatever. Two times, three times, fifty times, that is not the point.) And it is the doctor's policy to go over the results in person.\""\nTo which I said, 'Okay, if that's the case then that is fine and THAT is what your staff should be telling people because that is not a HIPAA violation. It has nothing to do with HIPAA and...\"" She interrupted and told me in a rather snotty tone that she had through the entire conversation that SHE will handle that part but, \""Do you want to schedule an appointment or not?\"" \nLet me just say this: I said, several times, that if there is something we need to discuss on the MRI in person, I'll gladly go down there, but if there is nothing on it, she can tell me that on the phone and I will continue to pursue the course of action I had felt was necessary. As I was stating this, she interrupted again to tell me that \""yelling\"" at her was not going to do any good. To which I replied, \""I'm not yelling. I'm simply talking to you about this situation.\"" She then said, \""I guess that's just your voice then.\"" WTF is wrong with you, lady? First of all, I am a customer who is trying to figure out what to do about a situation that you are making more difficult than it needs to be. SECOND, the bottom line is not whether or not I want to take time off or whether or not I pay a copay or whether or not your staff are incompetent. The point is my son is in pain every single day. He is ten years old and up until four months ago, he was fine. And you can let your incompetent doctor know it was a medication side effect she should have caught. Also, the results were sent to another doc as well who gave me the results ON THE PHONE."
"1","Felt very taken advantage of. I can save almost $500 by towing to another place. All they wanted was for me to get a credit card with them. Felt used, not helped."
"1","Vegetarian egg rolls: greasy and not so nice. Fried rice: greasy and not so nice. General Tso's chicken: arrived like a soup, there was so much brothy sauce I had to be careful not to tip the container. Also was supposed to be broccoli and chicken; two tiny spears of broccoli were the only vegies to be seen.\n\nI knew I was going for Middle America take-out Chinese and had low expectations, but the food really was only marginal. The service at the counter was nice and the food came out hot and fast. Just not my style."
"2","Ok. Let's just be serious for a moment. When you're home, and it's too hot to cook and you've worked all day...what about this crab puff craving you have? You call this place, like right now. It's so delicious for a empty not-so-busy place. Everything is so good, and delivery is ridiculous fast. You can easily find the menu online, sort of like all the other places out there, but their food is hot and delicious. If you ask for sauce on the side, everything is crunchy and amazing. Do it, and get the crab puffs. You know you want to!"
"2","The love...compassion.....dedication....PAYMENT PLANS will never be forgotten...true animal lovers the care they providedexceeded  my expectations. I am so grateful to the warm loving hearts. The knowledge was amazing the discussion and description of everything was amazing this truly is a place to take your loved animals.got won't find better :-)!"
"1","After dealing with a two week long migraine and severe pressure and pain in my face, I called around looking for an ENT that could get me in ASAP. Dr. Simms was available for a same day appointment and I scheduled with him for that afternoon. The wait time itself wasn't bad - 10-15 minutes after completing paperwork. \n\nDr. Simms was personable enough and after evaluating me, told me that he would like to treat for a sinus infection with antibiotics and prednisone. As I had just moved and newly became a student, I didn't yet have health insurance set up. Dr. Simms told me to give him a call the following week if the symptoms didn't subside after I was done with the meds, and he would prescribe an alternate antibiotic.\n\nI ended up going to a dental Urgent Care two days later on a Saturday because I woke up with immense pain and pressure in my tooth. An x-ray confirmed a sinus infection and I was told to follow up with my ENT on Monday. I called Monday morning and left a message for Dr. Simms. I called Tuesday and left another message since no one had called me back and I was in pain. Tuesday night, Dr. Simms' medical assistant called me back and told me that I had to come in to get a CT scan. I inquired about getting an additional rx for antibiotics as well as asked to discuss this with Dr. Simms directly. That request was ignored and I was told that she would attempt to book me for a CT scan and call back.\n\nTwo days later, I hadn't heard back and I called to leave another message. I was told that the medical assistant I spoke with no longer works there, so the receptionist or nurse had no idea what I was talking about. She told me she took down the message and I would get a call back. I stopped by the office later that day to drop off a copy of my x-ray and asked if Dr. Simms was in and if I could chat with him for a moment. I was told he was seeing patients and couldn't talk to me. Understandable, however I was willing to wait to get a word in with him. I was told again he wasn't available. When I explained the situation and that I had been struggling with this for three weeks and haven't been able to get a hold of him for a week at this point, the nurse/receptionist just shrugged.  I asked her to please have him call me specifically as I wanted to talk to my doctor directly. She told me someone would call me later. When I again insisted on a call from him specifically, she rudely told me again that \""*someone* will call\"". \n\nI took my x-ray, booked an appt at a different office and left. I've never experienced such cold and indifferent treatment at a doctor's office. Who wants to be treated by a doctor who doesn't return calls and whose front office staff is rude and uncaring both in person and on the phone? If you want someone reliable who will make you feel like you are a valued patient, go elsewhere!!!"
"1","6 words.. Burn your face, Shit your pants.\n\nIf you like overly greasy pizza that falls apart with cheese slapping you in the chin while trying to take a bite, then having an immediate stomach ache afterward, this is your place.\n\nRays has been around for a while, but I remember it being a lot better when I was in High School.. Perhaps it was an off day, but It just, wasn't good. And the girl at the counter could not have been hating life more. \n\nnext."
"2","Another great lunch at Ray's - 2 slices with drink for $4.00.  Crust was just right with golden brown edges, nice crisp on the bottom, moist & chewy in the middle, and topped with a tangy tomato and milky mozzarella cheese.  Crust has a lot of residual flour on the bottom, which is perfect for me (and preferable to cornmeal).\n\nStaff are always friendly and the atomosphere has a NY-tribute theme going.  An older crowd was enjoying their slices at lunch today, which is perfectly fine with me."
"1","I want to paint my bedroom.  I found a color I thought might work and as luck would have it my local Ace Hardware was the place for it.  So I dropped in there this morning thinking I would purchase a sample size to see how the color looked on the wall.  \nThe guy who was providing me customer service informed me \""we don't give samples\"". I explained I was expecting to pay for a sample, not be given one and his response was buy a quart or nothing.  No sample sizes for paint.  No wonder Ace Hardware stores are struggling to survive.  Who buys paint without a sample first? I mean, Home Depot, Lowes, Sherman Williams, they all have sample sizes.  And they all have better customer service."
"2","LOVE...this store!! Their prices on dog foods, treats and dog bones are excellent., plus the variety of brands that The Stock Shop carry  is far superior to any other pet food store in the Valley.  Everyone that works at this store gives a sense of ownership. They are super knowledgeable about any type of animal food, and immunization information. Additionally, they are eager to help their customers to ensure they are happy, with their shopping experience.\nI have been shopping at this store for almost a year, and when I leave I am always an extremely satisfied customer.\nThis is a wonderful family owned business!!"
"2","I have 2 hypoallergenic dogs who have so many allergies. It is so ironic! Anyways this is where I usually get my dog food. They have a great selection and I can find no chicken, no grain dog food like taste of the wild for my allergy dogs. If you don't see what you like, make sure you go in the back where they keep the big bags of dog food and other brands.\nI also like to get them frozen bones to chew on. They go nuts over these bones and will spend all day in the yard eating them. I will not let them in the house though because they get all gooey.\nI think the prices are pretty reasonable. I have not found the dog food any cheaper in the area.\nI think the cat department is lacking though. They do not have a big selection and I could not find any food for sensitive stomach cats. (Geez, my animals are so weird or maybe I am just neurotic?) They also do not have any cat toys for me to buy! This makes shopping difficult because I have to go to 2 different stores if I need cat stuff. Luckily she eats a lot less, so her food lasts so much longer. \nI also like to get my horse stuff here. They have lots of treats and supplies. It is mostly geared for the western type rider.\nYou can get your dog groomed here. They tried but didnt get the cut right so we haven't been back. \nIf you are feeling blue, go look at the cute little chicks! Adorable. It makes me want to get chickens because they are so cute. Then I think about chicken poop, and I am like no, no more animals. \n\nAlso check out the farmers market they have on the weekends. Support your local farmers and businesses! Its important. My cupcake lady (cupcake cafe) is there sometimes. Its great!"
"2","It's chicken time! My husband and I had been planning on getting chickens this January so we drove out to the west valley to The Stock Shop. On the phone they told us they had some baby chicks in stock, if they didn't have what we wanted they could order. \nThe staff was very friendly and helpful in answering questions and making recommendations for food and cage bedding. We picked out four little chicks, a bag of food and a 40lb bag of pine bedding all for around $32. Not bad! \nWe were told that the the likelihood of the chicks being female was 90%, as we wanted them for egg laying, and if they turn out to be male the shop will buy them back from you for $4 each. I guess we won't find out for a while but that's nice to know that they sort of guarantee their chicks. \nNice, clean store, plenty of parking, good customer service, fair prices."
"1","If you are looking fot Tennis classes for your kid, This is NOT a place to be. They have one basic class and put all their.\n\nAlso getting money back is really a problem. Very poor Customer Care and a very bad place for Tennis lessons.\n\nStaff is clue less and Management does not care too. I STILL have not got my money Thiefs !!"
"1","Okay, okay. I know what you're thinking. You went to the Walmart. For an oil change. But let me explain.  I HATE spending money on my car. I want my car to get me from point A to point B and could care less about aesthetics and maintenance. I am told however, that routine oil changes are necessary to keep the car in working order.  After driving roughly 3,000 miles over the suggested change date on the helpful sticker, I decided it's probably time. This is where the Walmart comes in. You go to the Walmart for things you hate spending money on like Q-tips and socks and Chapstick. I should have known better.\n\nThe oil service was not busy. I waited for ten minutes outside to even be checked in. The woman told me it would be 45 minutes for the oil change. I figured I would go run some errands with my mom and pick it up later. I came back a few hours later. The oil service team seemed quite hostile, even though it was 30 minutes before closing time. The manger made passive aggressive comments about how they tried to call me and it's my responsibility to update my phone number in their system so that they can contact me in case they need me to sign some paperwork. Woops. They cancelled my oil service because I was not there. After politely telling them that I could come back if they were closing, they had me sign the forms and took my car in to be serviced. After another 20 minutes, they rang me out with a lot of hostile glaring and rudeness. YOU CAN'T BE BETTER THAN ME IF YOU WORK AT THE WALMART. \n\nI will gladly pay the extra $20 at the Jiffy Lube to never experience that again."
"1","I dread going to this store, and avoid it if all possible.  I even am willing to drive a lot farther to the Fry's Electronics which is 15 minutes more of a drive to get something.  That says a lot.  Now this post is not to say I prefer Fry's, but just added that point to show my disgust with this store.  I keep hearing about Best Buy chain needing to do some major changes to stay relevant in today's economy.  Look no further than on 83rd and Bell Road to understand the need for the changes.  Poor customer service and over priced items just make this place my last resort for electronics shopping."
"2","I'm starting to really like Kohl's as much as I like J.C. Penney. (I like J.C. Penney)"
"1","Went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  I kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down Mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  Vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....Right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  It's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  I ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a Mexican pizza.  Food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  Pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  Margarita was weak also.  I usually get a little buzz going on when I order a large one, but I didn't get anything from that one.  As always the food at Macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....I think it's time to try something else even if I'm in the neighborhood."
"1","I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.  \nNow you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.  \n\nBut sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant.\nThey make McDonald version of Mexican food. \nI can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc. \nI am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food."
"2","I come here at least 2 times a week everyone is very polite food comes out quick. The teriyaki sauce is great brown rice always on point chicken cooked to perfection. The protein bowl is great for a post meal!"
"2","Great place. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. I really enjoyed my visit here."
"1","Been here before quite some time ago probably for a burro.  Came in today just for menudo. I won't be back for it again.  Before I could taste a spoonful I had to skim out quite honestly about 1/4 cup of oil/fat first. It literally filled the little styrofoam cup the onions/cilantro come in.   They don't clean the tripe, each piece had a layer of gooey fat on it.  Spoons were itty bitty, especially if your bowl had the pata."
"1","BEWARE!! He's a SALESMAN, NOT AN ETHICAL DENTIST. By far the WORST dentist I have ever been to. Even though he knew I worked at a dental school, and know A LOT more than an average patient about dentistry, he still proceeded to \""diagnose\"" $5300 worth of treatment for fillings, crowns, etc. I had my x-rays looked at my 5 dentists at work in the next week. I didnt have a single cavity. I only actually needed 1 filling. If you want to go to someone who will tell you that you need restorations on every tooth, he's your man. Also, the hygienist did not display proper infection control technique. Who knows what bacteria/disease may be in that office."
"1","Dirtiest Tablecloths in Phoenix area: At first the atmosphere is appealing, once you manage to get inside the non-broken door (are they EVER going to fix it?). The tablecloths at this place are simply disgusting. Plenty of stains, from overusage in the past and also sometimes fresh ones from the previous diners. Employees often have food stains on their white shirts, which I can't understand either. Overall, very dirty place.\n\nI managed to give the food a try anyway (don't ask why). Overall, very average for Indian Cuisine. The Naans were rather uninspiring, so stick to the paratha or poori. Vegetable Pakora is dry and chalky. Mint chutney is watery. To top it off, several of the menu items aren't available but they haven't changed the menu. They used to have a southern Indian chef who would make dosa. No more."
"2","I have been here three times since moving to Peoria.  I agree with some of the reviews on here saying that it may be a bit overpriced.  I must say though, the service is great, it's never crowded, and the food is very yummy.  \n\nI haven't been to India Palace, it's a bit out of reach for my liking so I don't really have a proper comparison. But until I do, I will keep going to Maharaja for the delicious Bhindi Masala (Fried Okra dish) and the Chala Masala (Garbanzo Bean w/ Cumin dish)  not to mention the Garlic Naan"
"2","What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring I've got enough na'an to sop up my plate's delightful curries.  I can't wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!"
"1","Been here a few times at lunch time because it's close to work, has a buffet, and costs about $10.  It's ok. Not the worse, not the best. I personally prefer Indian Palace (on this side of town) for the money.  Nothing here was extremely tasty or very spicy (I like spice and spicy); it was palatable.  Staff is fast on refills of water which is always appreciated."
"2","Great food. The vegetarian options are great off the menu esp the chili naan and malai kofta. The buffet is not so great in terms of options."
"1","Awful customer service."
"2","My husband and I hadn't gone there in many years - no idea why, but we always seem to end up in Arrowhead restaurant row,  fighting traffic and long waits (unless we're at Cheesecake Factory which always seems to have ample tables). It was our anniversary and we decided to try a different restaurant.\n\nWe were glad we went!  On a Friday night we only had to wait about 20 minutes, which we did at the bar - just enough time to have a drink.  The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down, even though the entire bar was full (we got the last 2 seats).\n\nAbout 10 minutes after arriving, the hostess found us in the bar and asked us if we wanted a table (she could seat us then) or if we wanted to wait for a booth (we did) - instead of just dragging us to a table.  We should have requested a booth when we arrived, and forgot, so it was nice that they asked before we vacated our seats at the bar.\n\nThe food arrived in a timely manner and was terrific - great steak and lobster and, again, great prices.  We really like the fact that you can order your steak to size according to your hunger: no reason for over eating unless you want to.  The veges were cooked just right - not too crisp nor too limp. The portions were all good sized except for my baked potato.  It wasn't as large as other restaurants, but maybe that's why I had room for dessert (usually don't). \n\nFor dessert we got the sampler, figuring it would be 3 small portions. Wrong!  They were all full-size as far as I'm concerned.  We both looked at it and said, \""how are we going to eat all this?\"" (we did lol). My husband liked the carrot cake & cheesecake, and I loved the pecan fudge brownie with ice cream/whipped cream/hot fudge.\n\nLast but not least, our server was full of personality - we really liked her and tipped her accordingly...\n\nAll in all, a great night! We won't let so much time go by before visiting again."
"1","Dive bar filled with perverts and heroin addicts. Looks like an Intervention Convention. Bartenders are weathered and bitter. Food tastes bad and they charge way too much considering they are a dive bar and not a nightclub."
"1","Cool place, but do NOT get the chicken. Mine was like rubber, I had to send it back and just didn't eat. So gross. Dirty place. But seems fun if you get drunk"
"1","Can't stand this place. The workout area smells terrible. I was told that my gym bag is too large and I am not allowed to bring it with me when I workout. My gym bag has equipment contained in it (belt, knee sleeves, lifting shoes, etc) and is always kept out of the way of others. At the same time, people are allowed huge racquetball bags lined up outside the racquetball courts. There are also weights left on the bar or not put away and I routinely find dumbbells where they don't belong and someone could easily trip over."
"2","I have to admit that I am a Stein Mart lover. Moreover I'm a bargain shopping fiend.\n\nFor what it is, this place is great. Kind of like a mix (in quality and selection) between Nordstrom's Rack and TJ Maxx. You can really find some great deals here.\n\nI'd say that the target shopper here is between 40 and 60+. I'm not in that demographic YET but if you are in the market for some great golf/business casual apparel then this is your spot. I'm a big fan of the Ben Hogan shirts. Great quality and here you can get a $100 shirt for $30 or $40 bucks.\n\nLast visit was a great one. My wife found a REALLY awesome pea-coat for herself. $250 bucks marked down to $60, then she used a 20% off coupon she found on the net. Can you say SCORE!?... Well I can.\n\nCheck it out. You may find something you like."
"1","Just came in. Two people in front of me. Waited. Someone else came in. Large man appears from behind counter, moves to help the people who came in after me. I said \""Need a ...\"" but the people who came on after me were served first. I have bought Iphone batteries, watch batteries here but my next order will be online."
"2","At about 12 o'clock this afternoon I was thinking to myself \""I want some pizza for lunch where should I go?\""\n\n\""Barro's!\"" I screamed outloud in reply to my own question. So I borrowed $5 from my old lady and off I went.\n\nI got the lunch special. Two slices of pepperoni pizza and a drink. I threw down the extra cash to get a side of ranch for dipping. Best decision of the day.\n\nThis location is a little far away from where I stay but it's worth the drive. Super clean place. Friendly staff. The girl at front counter is always nice. I don't know her name but she has a tattoo on the back of her neck. Thanks, neck tattoo girl! I'll be back tomorrow."
"1","I went to Lobo Nail & Spa yesterday while I was waiting for my husband to finish up a platelet donation.  Thought this could be a a really convenient way to multitask!  Pedicure was ok - but I was very disappointed when I rolled down the legs of my capris only to find that the tech had soaked the hem area with oil.  Neither she or the manager offered any compensation at that time.  They told me it would wash out in the laundry.  Guess what - IT DIDN'T!  Took the capris in & showed the manager.  He was very apologetic and told me he would have them cleaned at the dry cleaners.  I'm happy to report that the cleaner was able to remove the stains.  Sadly I am skeptical of using this facility again.  Was way too much hassle!"
"1","Very rude customer service. I had came to drop off and pick up a prescription for my son and noticed three boxes of diapers for 18.99 each. I go to pay and the rude man says it's 28.99. I go back to show him that there was more then one and it showed the price for 18.99. He replies \""that's for another brand and I'm not giving it to you for that price\"" Could he have been any more ruder. I mean I know it was close to midnight and he might have been moody and tired but this will be the last time I step into this Walgreens."
"2","I took my mom with me to Carrabba's to celebrate a new job because it is her favorite restaurant. We were not disappointed.\n\nWhen I started to realize that we had been sitting for a few minutes without seeing a server, a manager walked over, apologized for the delay and took our appetizer and drink order. \n\nWe started with the delicious bread and then had crab cakes, that were oh-so-yummy. The drinks were delicious and the waiters were amusing. The atmosphere is casually Euro-hip and the open kitchen is always bustling with excitement. \n\nWhen my Spiedino Di Mare (shrimp, scallops and asparagus) arrived, I was a bit put off by the look of the plate. For about $20, I received a bland plate with soggy yellowing spears of asparagus, 4 medium sized scallops and 4 pieces of stuffed shrimp. Nevertheless, it smelled GREAT. \n\nI dove into the scallops immediately and they seemed to melt deliciously away on my tongue. The stuffed shrimp were had the same basic components - breaded and grilled with a generous lemon butter sauce to swim in.\n\nThe manager came over to check on us and I decided the asparagus wasn't too foul of a move since everything else was pleasant, so I didn't tell him. I'm surprised he didn't ask why I hadn't eaten any of the pitiful looking vegetable on the plate, however.\n\nThat being said, I love Carrabba's and will definitely be back!"
"1","I am giving one star for Zach the waiter and one star for Heather the Manager..... I eat gluten free due to my health issues.  I went here specifically because they cater to the GF crowd.  That being said after the time I had I am rather worried because if they are as GF cautious as they are about HOW they cook: Meh, not so confident!!!\n\nI started out with a side salad with their house Creamy Parmesan dressing.  The dressing was quite tasty but the salad was less than fresh.  It was plentiful with carrots, thinly sliced celery and some other items but the romaine lettuce was extremely brown and had that taste which told me:  I AM NOT FRESH!  Honestly, it was so brown I just told him to take it away.\n\nHe suggested I try soup instead so I had him bring me some lentil soup which was really very good.  It made up for the salad.  My Iced Tea was good as well.   The hubs got a Magharita Pizza which he said was very good.  The basil and tomato were very fresh and good but there was not much mozz on it at all.  The dough was perfectly done.\n\nThis restaurant prides itself on being a \""from scratch kitchen\"" and they encourage changes to menu items if needed.  That being the case, I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which is grilled chicken breast stuffed with Fontina and Prosciutto, with mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce.  I didn't want the lemon butter sauce so they were going to replace it with the Marsala wine sauce...this was Zach's suggestion, by the way!\n\nUpon getting my entree, which was two very small breasts, it was in the butter lemon and not marsala sauce.  I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.  If you've had either of these versions the one thing you would note is:  They taste horrible together!  It sucked.\n\nSo I told Zach that they had just given me back the original breast with new sauce and he said:  Well, it would take too long to remake the whole thing so he just put it back on the grill to grill off the lemon sauce and then replaced it with the Marsala.  WHAT???  Really??\n\nUm, I just said FINE. and told the hubs we will NEVER be back.  The next thing I know, Heather, a manager is stopping by the table.  She says, \""I hear things aren't going well today....\"" and I then told her our story.  She then states that not only has she taken my entree off the bill but she is making me the corrected version to go and giving us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try.\n\nWell, I am impressed a bit by this.  Taking it off the bill was nice but adding the additional two \""gives\"" made it almost okay.  It's too bad they just couldn't have made it a five star experience the first time....but given that they were so generous, I'll at least give them the chance to do it right.\n\nTo be continued.............."
"1","If I could leave a negative star review, I would. This was the absolute worst dining experience I've ever had. We were seated and then ignored for 45mins. I sat at the table with my hand obnoxiously raised while 4 servers proceeded to walk past without stopping to ask if we needed anything. I then proceeded to ask the hostess to speak with the manager, to which she said she would go get him, only to turn around and seat another table, completely ignoring my request. I then asked the bartender to speak with the manager who took my request and turned his back and went about his business. I asked 2 more servers who the manager was before I actually got a chance to speak with him. The manager couldn't care less about the horrid service we were receiving. A server finally came over who took am additional 15mins to get out drink order and messed up our food order. I think it's safe to say I will never again return to Carrabba's ever again. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"1","We will not be eating there or recommending anyone to the Bell Road location. Upon entering the restaruant, we had a very foul odor that hit us; this should have been our first clue. \n\nThe service was horrible!! Being an ex server, I always tip well and see it from the server side. However, in this case...both the food and service were REALLY bad.\n\nTo make matters worse, the meal I ordered I could not eat...it was that bad. The manager would not take off our bill.  Basically, I was told...you did not know what you were ordering and it is not our mistake.  I am Italian and I know what Italian food...\n\nIf you are in the mood for Italian, I would not pick this location."
"1","Food is okay. Most of the menu seems high priced. Service is inconsistent. One day it's great and another day it's bad. If the service was exceptional all the time the high menu prices wouldn't be as noticeable. Happy hour is okay with discounts on drafts, drinks and appetizers (bar only). They have about a dozen televisions in the bar plus trivia, and karaoke."
"1","Dirty tap lines are the norm here.  They had an Orange Hefe-Weizen once, and every beer that replaced it on that tap line has had an orange taste.  Often it's something quite obvious, like a pilsener, where the orange comes right out.\n\nThere's a putrid sewer smell that won't go away from this location.  I'm not sure if it is too costly to get rid of it, but it is there every time I've made a visit in hopes that the place will improve.\n\nMenu is pretty much the same as all the other Old Chicago chain restaurants.  Pizza is average, and offers little in variety.  They don't do a traditional Chicago pizza like Gino's or Giordano's, and in fact one of their specialty \""Chicago\"" crusts is just simply the addition of corn meal.\n\nMusic is often too loud, and the jukebox seems to attract the Nine Inch Nails type of crowd with a pocket full of quarters.  Service is inconsistent and often poor."
"1","Absolute worst service experience EVER. My boyfriend and I went in and sat in the bar and waited for 15 minutes and were ignored. We then politely asked the hostess if we could sit in the dining room instead due to not being able to get service in the bar. We waited for another ten minutes at another table and finally left."
"2","LARGE beer selection and cool beer program for frequent visitors, paired with good selection of pizza, and other pizza joint offerings.  I LOVE their deep dish pizza and love how they do have some crispy toppings from the oven as well.  Many TV's in the bar and quite a few out in the dining room as well."
"1","Fresh off a trip to Houston and back in town, my friend and I decided to stop by here to start the new mini-tour.  I have been visiting this location for about 3 and a half years and have completed two, almost three world beer tours. \n\nWhen I entered I asked for Adam, our usual server, as he does a great job (usually leave 25-30% tip as he is great). He wasn't in, so we were stuck with a server that I have had in the past who is \""so-so\"". \n\nWe sit down and start watching the football game. He approaches and asks what we would like to drink. I respond with, \""We are looking to start the mini beer tour\"". He explains how it works, we order the $3 beer on special and then he asks for ID. In Texas, they required me to surrender my Arizona License and they printed out a temporary. I present it to him and he quickly takes it over to the manager. \n\nI figured it would be a quick conversation as I have seen the same thing happen twice before and the manager recognizes its valid. It takes about 30-60 days for Texas to create and mail the license so I knew this could be a potential issue, but never go in the direction it headed. Much to my surprise, he comes over and says he cannot serve me. I responded, \""Let me talk to Summer\"". (Summer is the manager, I have been coming to this location since she was a server and she had helped me at least a half dozen times over the years). I explained the situation with the driver's license and that I had been coming to this establishment for years. \n\nFirst of all, she didn't recognize me. When I tried to point out how long I have been coming here and that Adam usually serves my friend and I, all she said is, \""Adam is in tomorrow and he can serve you then. Unfortunately because this waiter asked you for your ID we can't serve you\"". Does that make any sense?!?! So if I come in tomorrow with my ID and don't get asked for it, then everything is okay?!?! Something smells fishy....\n\nSecond, I flew back on a plane from Houston and cleared security to fly a plane with my temporary ID! Also, if law enforcement pulled me over my ID would be valid. Is Old Chicago holding its customers to a higher standard? And why will other restaurants accept the ID except for them?\n\nAnyways, I am going to call and ask for the district managers phone number and talk to him/her. I have been a loyal customer for years and do not believe this is how a person should be treated!"
"2","Really creative sushi and you gotta love a place that has the bento box."
"1","The sushi was not at all good. The service was on the poor side. Our one and only visit was not enjoyable."
"2","Since we have found Tokyo Lobby we have stopped going anywhere else.  Our favorites are Monkey Brains and the Playboy Roll.  The Playboy Roll is one of those rolls that you can't stop thinking about until you get it again.  It is really that good.\nThe restaurant is small but we have never had to wait to get in.  \nThe owner is usually there and very attentive.\nI highly recommend this place!!"
"2","Yeah, thats a 5 star....I don't hand those out like candy....XD\n\nBest happy hour than any sushi place......AND $5 bombers with large sake.\nThey will bring you cold sake if you ask for it. IMO its better because it doesn't warm up your beer.\n\nI go here on Fridays, probably once a month, maybe more. Went 3 weeks in a row when I first found it.\nOwners name is Kelvin, he is cooler than cool.... -273 degrees Celsius to be exact...XD\nHe will take a photo of your group with his shhhweet camera and pin it to the cork board if you ask him to.\n\nNew happy hour menu is good  5 or 6 different $6 rolls.\nMy favs are the eel and vegas. \n\nLook for me if you go on a friday, we'll be the loud group in the corner drinking sake bombers hahaha"
"2","This is my to-go-to sushi spot. Great location on bell road. The place itself is pretty small and intimate which usually is what I tend to like. They have really cute patio...by cute I mean it has a little romantic vibe to it. Great place for a date night or just to hang out with the ladies. \n\nThe food here is pretty good. My usual is the spicy tuna roll and Mexican roll with miso soup of course. They just changed their happy hour which is awesome because Monday-Thursday is happy hour all day! Now who wouldn't love that?!\n\nWith all that being said, the only thing I wish they would work on is customer service. For some reason the last past 3 times I've been here I tend to feel rushed. Servers are polite but I feel like they just want me to hurry up and eat then leave right after. I hope this changes because I truly like this place and wouldn't want to go else where for sushi. Till next time Tokyo Lobby!"
"1","The owners are very rude.. food is OK..not the best"
"2","Love Ahso!!! Favorite place to go. Happy hour at 9;00 has best prices for fabulous food. I don't eat rice so I had them replace with soy paper and it was delicious... Awesome food and service. Great for little get togetherness with friends or date. They have a DJ on Saturday nights. No dancing but good atmosphere."
"2","I love this place! I try something new every time I go and I love everything! Service is great. Happy hour specials are great. Definitely recommend."
"1","That was GROSS. Some of the worst sushi and worst service I have ever received in my life. I LOVE sushi and am very disappointed not only in the service and food but also in the way the manager handled the situation (or FAILED to handle). I have been a server, manager and NEVER complain. But I cannot believe how awful this was. I'm praying I don't get food poisoning."
"1","I think its time America got rid of Walmarts."
"1","I hate Walmart in general.... THIS Walmart is the worst. It's always dirty with long lines and disgusting people. I pay 2x more to go to target."
"1","Anyone who has had REAL BBQ would laugh at this place.  Having had some of the best Q in the world in TX, SC,NC,TN,MS,AL,GA and KS; this is woefully bad.  I ordered two racks and a pound of brisket to go.  One rack I ordered dry so I could see what they really look like.  No bark, and gray.  A sure sign of BBQ that was cooked in an oven and not a pitt.  The brisket was even worse.  If you have ever had real brisket in TX (Southside Market, Salt Lick, Kruez), you'll laugh at this.  Way too thin, way too gray and tough.  \n\nThey obviously do not serve the same Q in the restaurant as they do at a competition.  Q this bad would never win any award.  I also stopped here based on the TV show, and Guy is nuts if he thought this was good."
"2","I could drink their BBQ sauce! Unbelievable taste and superior cookins'\n\nI used to get the pulled pork sandwich and beer fries all the time when I lived close to their Phoenix location. Me and a bunch of guys adopted the name \""armpitts\"" for this place for not other reason than the name and we wanted something fun to say that we all knew what we were talking about. One fella would look to another and utter \""armpitts\"", the other would nod (or sometimes accompany the nod with an \""mmmmm\"") and both would hop in the car and head out, dragging 3-4 other guys with them without any objection.\n\nClassic BBQ... it just doesn't get any better than this!"
"1","BEWARE, THIS PLACE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS!\n\nThe service is terrible, we waited 10 minutes before our drink order was taken. When we got our meals, 2 half racks of ribs with potatoes and cornbread, they were both served cold and needed to be sent back. When we asked to speak with a manager, another server came out and talked to us, whom was not a manager. \n\nWhen we DEMANDED to speak to a manager, they sent out some guy not in a uniform, covered in tattoos, who claimed to be the manager. He was very rude and it seemed like we were bothering him with our complaint. When we told him about the problem we were having, he took our plates back to the kitchen, and brought us another half rack of ribs each, they were just as dry as the first ones. It seemed like they just stuck it in the microwave and slapped some BBQ sauce on it. \n\nThe thing that bothered me the most, and gave me the motivation to come here and write this review, was the fact that after he brought out our replacement ribs, i could hear him and another waiter, bad mouthing us from the kitchen for complaining about the overcooked food. What kind of business will insult a customer due to their food being served cold and overcooked.  \n\nThis place has gone downhill. I'll never return, and I would go out of my way to deter anyone from wasting their money at this place."
"1","After seeing  this restaurant on a food TV special we figured we would check it out.  We first noticed that their parking lot smelled of sewer.  Their  food was mediocre at  best.  I ordered the chili that was not up to standards on temperature, however, their fried mushroom were awesome and freshly made.  I wasn't wowed by their customer service either."
"1","This place is horrible, I was assisted by one employee and she was more interested in signing me up for a credit card then actually helping me. Every time I asked to see a ring she would make a comment about how I needed to get something more expensive and not so cheap. She didn't listen to anything I asked for. On top of all that she kept whispering about giving my different amounts of discounts while looking over her shoulder. Very weird!"
"1","I bought stuff from this place twice. Tookmforever because the selection was bad and prices ridiculous. Quality not so good, for slver there were better dealsmat tj maxx than using a 100. Off coupon. They alsontried to tell us my wife's diamond was shattered when we inquired about a trade in. Most of their sales help were like used car salespeople and lied through their teeth. I had three negative shopping experiences here, returned everything bought, and found higher quality at lower prices elsewhere. BUYER BEWARE. Sorrt for typos, using my ipad."
"1","Delivery is not very good !! Was late and didn't bring plastic wear or plates or not even soy sauce! Very disappointed specially because we have order many times from there before and lately not getting good service."
"2","I'm pretty surprised by the reviews. We have been here more than a handful of timea for lunch and dinner. Food is fresh and plenty. Service is pleasant. Only drawbacks are long wait times for carry out and dine in. Orange chicken and hot sour soup are delicious!"
"1","Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns.  Hard to beat that.\n\nThis location suffers from one major flaw - that it is located alongside a busy road in the parking lot of a Home Depot.  So, this means there are tons of... let's say... loiterers.  When a patrol car occasionally makes a round through here, the loiterers all scramble into Del Taco or run in various directions.  They also stare at your car in the parking lot if it happens to be nice.\n\nSo, drive your beater if you eat here, and don't eat here if you're bothered by a lot of loiterers outside."
"1","I've had Subway many times before moving to Arizona so I know they have good sandwiches. However, I will never eat at this particular Subway. My husband ordered two Turkey sandwiches to go and it was literally the worst sandwich I ever had in my life. Stale bread, and something definitely funky with the turkey, cheese, and lettuce. Like they used old ingredients.  I was sharing my sandwich with my 3 year old but after tasting it, I threw it in the garbage because I was afraid that we were going to get sick. Will not try anything from there again."
"1","If I didn't have a big pizza in front of my face, I would have thought I ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you.\n\nMaybe it's because we came in with a coupon...but this place had more ego than a 15 minute celebrity.  \n\nNot to knock small, family owned places (usually I love going to places like that, because USUALLY you get a friendly family feel), but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to Albertson's, they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar.\n\nThings not so awesome:\n1.  Whomever answered the phone didn't know East from West to be able to give directions\n2.  Our waitress couldn't give any suggestions on the food\n3.  They can't do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra\n4.  You pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food\n5.  ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE, ATTITUDE\n6.  Tip was already included in our bill\n\nI've never been to a family run pizzeria that can't do a half and half pizza, and the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you'd feel more comfortable wearing  a dress - definitely not one in a strip mall like this one.\n\nI swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did, they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo.\n\nAnd last time I looked, I believe I was old enough to do my own math for your tip.  If you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip, maybe you should learn a little something called Cuss-toe-mer Sur-viss.\n\nFoodwise, the pizza was not the best I've ever had, in fact it was a bit on the dry side.   I can't say it was absolutely horrible, but neither can I say I was in heaven.  The wings were much better, in my opinion.\n\nFor the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers, this is a definite no-peat."
"1","Chairs are uncomfortable... The only time they act like they understand  or speak English is when your talking about price & times up for massage.  I liked the cucumber scrub & didn't have to wait long.  Not a bad place to go if in the area but I've been to a lot better."
"1","What I love about Rubios' is that they always have beer. Always.\n\nThat is all I love though..."
"2","Superior customer service is hard to come by in fast food establishments. This Rubios is absolutely fantastic. The woman operating the register, Marina was wonderful. Always smiling and keeping busy. As a good employee should do. I would hire her in a heartbeat. Keep up the great work at this location guys."
"1","Walked in today to browse around, then se something interesting. A laser printer for $50. Looking around there were no associates to help. Walked to one if the registers to ask for assistance and was told the asst mgr would help me as soon as he finished bringing up the furniture. So while waiting for him, I browsed more selections. And after about 5 mins he showed up, asked if I still required help and then stated if I can hold on for a couple more minutes so he could get me a specialist. That threw me for a spin a bit. U would think the asst mgr could help me a bit before just sending me back out to wait. I can see that customer service is not a priority in this establishment. If it was, you would think that I would be assisted somewhat while waiting for the so called specialist. Unfortunately he just walked away. \n\n20 mins later and still no one, the asst mgr came back up to me as I finally walked up to me and asked if I was helped. Nope, no one helped me, not even you. He apologized and then stated sorry, maybe next time. Really, next time, are you serious. Why even bother, if no one knows what's happening in the store, especially the asst mgr."
"2","These guys have won awards for their jewerly, I can see why they have beautiful things, plus their prices are great.  Check them out."
"2","The hubby & I go there very frequently now...addicted to the margaritas!  We've tried more of the menu and it's ALL been great.  We like to share the giant burrito (yep, it's huge) that's loaded with only with a really tasty shredded beef (I hate rice and beans in a burrito) and covered with a delicious red sauce. We always sit outside since the inside is so blah, but it's so hot right now, we'll have to wait til it cools off a bit.  We'd get it to go, but we HAVE to have their margys!  The guys behind the counter are awesome and very friendly."
"1","If I could give ZERO stars I would.  Dr. Julie Jacobs is honestly the worst doctor (and I use that term loosely) I have ever been to.  She stands and stares at you and doesn't really answer questions directly.  Honestly she acts like she doesn't even know what she is talking about when she does answer.  She did a biopsy on my daughter and dropped the scalpel and the dripped blood all over her skirt!  And prior to the biopsy she wasn't even going to test my daughter for MRSA but was just going to prescribe meds without knowing what was growing on her leg!!!  Isn't that what started MRSA in the first place?  Over prescribing antibiotics?  When we thought my daughter was having an allergic reaction to the numbing shot she just stared at us and said \""that has nothing to do with this....do you have anxiety??\""  I almost died!  \n\nAnd just to add to this she also makes you schedule an appt for every \""issue\""....you can't go in for acne and a skin lesion.  You need separate appts (and do pays).  They also make you come in every 3 months to write you a new prescription so they can charge you a co pay as well.  Beware!!!!!!!!!"
"2","Hot bagels is a quick easy stop on my way to work.  I always get the breakfast sandwich double toasted and have never been disappointed."
"2","Great good. Fresh bagels, fresh bread, they put lots of meat on the sandwiches. And you can't beat the prices. Very affordable."
"2","So good! Love starting my morning off here!"
"2","If you're wasting your time at Einstein's or the like, stop. Go to Hot Bagels. Simply the best bagels I've had here in Arizona and best since the old Western Bagel Company back in the San Fernando Valley. It's a guaranteed stop two to three times a week, much to the non-delight of my cardiologist and my wife."
"2","I ordered 2 floral arrangements for a funeral and specified the price range and a few of the flowers and colors I wanted and my preference for something simple but elegant.  They did a fabulous job and both arrangements stood out from the rest.  The cost was reasonable compared to other florists and I would definitely recommend them.  This was the first time I used this location but have been pleased with all the arrangements from other AJ's locations."
"1","My son was taken there by his friends after breaking his wrist. He had his wrist reduced and they sent him home and told him to follow up with a doctor on Monday (his accident happened on Friday). My wife who is a nurse saw that he had an open fracture, meaning the bone had broken through the skin. She called over to the hospital she works at and the surgeon told her to bring or soon in right away, that he was at risk for infection and needed to be on IV antibiotics. We brought him in right away and he had surgery that day. Good thing we got a second opinion. I don't trust that hospital. I went to the ER there because it was close and they gave me some passion medicine for kidney stones and sent me home. When I went to my.doctor later that afternoon he admitted me to the hospital immediately with a perforated ureter. Good thing I followed up with my doctor our I would have been in real trouble. Avoid that place at all costs. I have given one star because zero stars is not an option."
"1","First off,it is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there... which is annoying. My daughter is a new patient with them and the first time I called to schedule a appointment the lady was rude and always interrupted when I spoke,there was a day where I couldn't make it in and I called to see if I could schedule a later appt,and the receptionist said abruptly that I couldn't because the doctor was leaving and there are no open spots today and I needed to take my daughter in right at that very moment... another day I came in the doctor we asked to be my daughters doctor and I even know what she looks like wasn't even our doctor,she didn't even tell us her name,she didn't even physically check on my daughter and I had to do all the work,not to mention this day I came in to check up on my daughter's burn marks... She didn't say much and didn't really do anything.. I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here.. as of now I just called to schedule another appt,also not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back again,so as of now I called in to schedule another check up.... they open at 8? Yeah I'm pretty sure!  Ring Ring no answer,call again..ring ring no answer.. called 4 times and no answer. No they were not busy it rang for a long time, I'm not site if they're busy or ignoring calls. But I'm giving them one more chance and if it it blows bye bye arrowhead pediatrics."
"1","I searched Yelp to try find decent Sushi while visiting Phoenix with my family. My wife and I went here after looking at reviews and we were extremely disappointed. Our server was very polite and attentive, but the quality of the sushi was very poor. My wife likes rolls and I prefer Nigiri. We were worried when we got there and he menu showed almost every roll containing \""crab mix\"". This is code for a blend of artificial crab meat and some kind of mayo or similar sauce - aka cheap filler. We crossed our fingers and ordered anyways. \nFirst we had appetizers: spring rolls and miso soup. The spring rolls were deep fried, flavorless mush. We ate one if the four. The miso soup was so salty we couldn't finish. \nThe rolls came next and, like the spring rolls, they were mushy and flavorless. So sad. The Nigiri was yellowtail and had a strong fishy taste which, if you've ever had Hamachi, you know its supposed to be a mild flavor with no fishy taste. \nThis is the first time I've ever sent an entire meal back and asked not to pay. We paid for our drinks and left the waitress a nice tip (wasn't her fault) and left. \nThe owner / manager was nice but said he tried our food and thought it was acceptable   (Huh?). \nWorst part was that we wasted a rare , kid -free date night on this place. I've had sushi from venues ranging from grocery stores to fancy places in Tokyo, and this was hands down the worst attempt at Sushi I've tasted."
"1","Gluten free people need Tamari, I understand you have soy sauce but that doesn't help me, come on Sakana, we come here so often, it's 3 dollars."
"2","They have a good lunch special and happy hour prices. I have never been there for regular menu prices to know what the cost is."
"2","We've eaten here many times and the food is always good. It's always busy which shows me the food is good. Spaghetti and meatballs is a favorite along with their pizzas. They have a great Happy Hour menu so check it out!!"
"2","Someone told me about this place and their all you can eat spaghetti. They also mentioned that they have great meatballs...so I had to check it out myself. \nThe first thing that bothered me was the noise level...it's like all the conversations going on in this place remained within the walls. However, the staff was very friendly and the service was good. \nI had the Artichoke, Shrimp & Crab Dip which was good, but I wish it had more chucks of crab. I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good, but not  the best I've had. The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that \""wow\"" factor, but it was good (just not the best). I had also ordered a customize Calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! The size and flavor were definitely in the \""wow\"" factor. This helped to push the rating to a 4 star plus the service."
"2","I have been coming here for several years now and they are simply the best little Italian place. The Devore is always changing and stunning. They have impeccable service and I love their food! This is my husband and I's \""place\"" if you know what I mean. Try them out and if your not a fan of what you order try something else. They have food for many different tastes and I highly recommend trying lots of different stuff. Oh and join their loyalty text group for coupons and special deals!"
"1","Customer Service lacking! Cleanliness Null & Void!!!"
"1","Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business."
"1","I went there after purchasing a living social deal.  First of all, I want my nail done French and they said they couldn't do it, they didn't know how. The pedicure was disappointing.  She didn't cut my cuticles and did a  sloppy job on my toes.  The lady was nice, but talked to much. I really enjoy the massage chairs and bubbly foot soak. The chair was basic and they brought out a bowl of water for the soak. I was also supposed to get a glass of champagne, but of course they didn't have it.  I had a shellac nail treatment.  They again don't soak your hands or cut your cuticles.  She missed a large area on my thumb.  Very disappointing experience.  I will never go back.  I will stick with the asians. They do nails best."
"1","I give two stars because I usually use this location to get water before a hike. Yesterday I come in to get water and the cashier is talking with her manager about something and making me wait for like 5 minutes. Cashier acknowledged me no hi how are you and no smile. Staff needs to be trained and store needs a cleaning. Will I come back.....maybe"
"1","Terrible customer service. Called ahead to make sure truck was there and when we got there they gave us a larger one that personal auto coverage won't cover. Said only A truck was guaranteed, not a specific size. Told me if I cancelled now would be a $50 charge. Will not be back with haul next door.\n\nRevised to one star. Came to return my truck. They surrounded my car so it can't get out. Called the number on the receipt they said there's nothing they can do until tomorrow. Calling police next. Insane!"
"1","We went here today around 5 o'clock on a Saturday. There were six adults and three children. The chips (some soggy) were cold and uneventful. The bean dip and salsa - complementary, we just okay.  The tea was okay. The margaritas that my friend had was lacking in flavor and booze. The Shirley temples were sort of flat and just okay.  The crispy cheese crisp was alright. The cheese just sort of reminds me of melted candle wax. There's nothing special or flavorful about any of the cheese. Chicken taco was bland and boring, boiled chicken, with no flavor. The beef taco was okay. The food was not hot. It came out just warm. The refried beans were just alright. One of our friends had the fried ice cream. The picture on the menu makes it look really big. But in reality it's very small.\n\nWe liked going to the Arriba on Camelback, and we were expecting good service and pretty flavorful food like we get there. This Arriba was very bland and unsatisfying. I will avoid the place. Maybe the Camelback one is still good. But this one just tastes like boxed macaroni and cheese. Everything had pretty much no flavor."
"1","I used to enjoy coming here. But man, what happened? Did management change, because everything was awful. The host was rude. Our server Brian had attitude and didn't seem to care about our needs. The food was meh. My friend ordered a house margarita and it tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. So she sent it back and said she didn't want a different margarita. The manager came over and tried to get her to buy the more expensive margarita because it would taste better. I'm sorry, but shouldn't the manager just bring her a complimentary margarita because she was unhappy with her previous one? He lingered longer trying to get her to buy one. The waiter didn't notice our drinks needed to be refilled, so we had to keep reminding him. I ordered some spicy chicken tacos-- the chicken tasted like it had been marinated in Frank's Hot Sauce, yuck! I also asked the manager to put the chicken in corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas. They charged $2 for doing that!!! What the heck! I've never experienced that. My friends enjoyed their food though. No one was friendly and the manager just seemed clueless. I won't ever be going back."
"1","Was a big fan until yesterday. Hot sauce used to be the best, now just tasted like tomato sauce. Food was awful, they're only excuse was that they are training new chefs. Sadly, we will not go back."
"1","I'm not surprised by the reviews and wished I would have read them before going.  What I am surprised about is how many negative reviews there are going back several years and the same problems remain...hello?\n\nThis was our first and last visit.  There's no \""Steak House\"" apeal at all.  It more resembles a nursing home.  Not only the cliental but the decor as well.  Even when the phone rings, it seems to be amplified so everyone has an opportunity to hear it.  Management seemed very out of touch not only with the guests but the employees as well.  \n\nThe portions on the sides were very small and the 16 oz Ribeye I had ordered medium rare...half, yes half of the steak they praise was medium well and the other half was RARE, very very rare.  They forgot to bring out my mashed potatoes and once they did after I said something they were very dry.  Everything I had lacked flavor and care.  I could go on about the other 3 dishes my family had and didn't care for, however I really want to put this behind us. \n\nOnce a week my family and I try something new...we will not be back!"
"2","So I'm strolling along the mall and I come upon this store.  I looked around a little before leaving, but something caught my eye and I kept it in mind for the return pass through.\nI went back in and was helped by Jennifer, who couldn't have been nicer, more knowledgeable or helpful.\nAfter her recommendation on a few scents, we put together a package that she wrapped nicely.  She told me about their return policy, which includes the recipient returning a scent if not satisfied, even without the receipt.  Very nice. I felt much better about buying something here.\nWhat a great little store."
"1","I have been taking my kids to Great Destinations since my first child was born in 2008. After 5 years of loyal service, three children, and multiple visits we have come to feel a part of their family.... until today when we got a phone call saying we can't come back because we missed 3 appointments... in five years I might add. I understand that policy; however, I think it is simply ridiculous when you look at the big picture. I think missing 3 appointments in one year or three consecutive appointments or something like that makes more sense. \n\nFurthermore, I didn't even know I had missed three appointments in that length of time. It would be prudent for their office to inform you when you've missed two so you can be more aware of it. I'm really flabbergasted at this point, however, I will gladly take my business elsewhere.  Goodbye!"
"1","Hello to all Christians who read this. In these times we are living where our freedoms are being stripped away by our government on a monthly basis, I urge you to find another business to get a massage.  I canceled my membership as a result along with 7 others due to the harassment I received after a question was asked to get an opinion on a Biblical issue.  \n\nThis act was unprofessional and terrible service to a loyal customer. How long will it be until your freedom to address an employee's question no longer be accepted??  Will you please stand with us!?"
"1","When i was a kid toys r us were nice!! This is a dumb!!!!!! Gross old dumb!!"
"2","Pop culture heaven in useful items like clothes, wallets, phone cases, jewelry, music, fragrances and more for both males & females. Always love the variety. Pricey, but they usually run sales so you rarely have to pay full prices."
"1","I really don't know what to say about Mimi's caf\u00e9 other than Bad bad bad it took me over eight minutes to put in a drink water and then I asked for a simple thing ice tea you would think this would be easy unfortunately they serve me sweet tea Needless to say I sent it back 10 minutes later my tea arrive knowing that I ordered iced tea you would think that the waitress would not serve me hot tea but I was served Hot tea this may be a great restaurant for someone in Sun City this looking for a hot cup of tea and a egg white omelette because that seemed to be exactly who was there and may God love them but I don't like hot tea that is why I ask for iced tea anyway I just wanted to paying my check and Run"
"1",":( The service was fast. We ordered (2) meals. The Bouillabaisse seafood soup and the Bavette Steak with Brussels sprouts. The french onion soup was excellent. The soup was ok; it would have been nice to see some seafood in it for it was little. The Bavette Steak was awful. There were (5) strips of tough meat and the sprouts were burned; maybe they were trying cajun. Don't know, but it wasn't worth $17.50 :("
"1","I love the food court at this mall, but thats about it. The security guards are very rude and not helpful at all! I also don't agree with the 50 smokers in the outside area. I used to enjoy sitting out there with my daughter and husband, but now it's nothing but full of tobacco smoke and pre-teens. Still better than metro center though..."
"2","Really an enjoyable Macy's. not too big but has all your needs. Customer service is also good!"
"1","Avoid like the plague."
"2","Tastiest burgers in town. Nothing like the burgers here to feed an appetite. Very high quality meet, drinks, hamburger bar for toppings, TVs. Awesome deal."
"2","A good enough spot to eat. I have to say its neither worst or best buffet. I enjoy the breakfast items especially the French toast. I love that they're one of the last buffets to have chocolate milk and not charge extra for it. I was really impressed with the new desserts. But any place that had unlimited bacon , you have my vote.lol. Great spot if you're single or with a group."
"1","Price is too high for what you get. The food is mediocre , the employees are rude, the manager was leaning on the salad bar talking on his cell phone. \nSteak was tough, fish was dry and selection very limited. \nSave your money and spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere."
"1","Yep, just meh. The pizza is pretty big, but bigger is not always better my friends. Pizza had no flavor-I felt like I put peppers, salt, and parm on this poor piece of pizza but nothing really made it much better. Crust was also just a boring crust. \n\nService was good-people were nice. The place was clean-had a few T.Vs around with sports and shows. Not busy at all on a Wednesday night-but not many places really are. Probably won't come back."
"1","I never thought I'd be reviewing a McDonald's, because I do not support McDonald's and am ashamed of myself every time I go, but I just have to say...I have been going to this McDonald's since it was first built. While their inside is pretty clean and nicely renovated, I never go inside, so my review is in regards to their drive through. I would say that 9 out of the 10 times that I go there, they mess up my order. I have just grown to expect that I won't get what I ordered. Ask for grilled chicken? You'll get crispy. Ask for coffee with no sugar? It will be sweet as hell. Oh, and also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that they NEVER fill up their fries all the way anymore! Good grief."
"1","I received another telemarketing call from this business (623-930-0356). I reminded them again that my number is on the national do not call list. They told me it's my job to tell them to remove my number, it's not their job to check that list first. Do not do business with this company that can't listen to people or follow the law."
"2","Update 2/18/2013...  Still a BIG fan of their brownies.  Either I missed the pre-packaged ones the past couple of times I stopped there or they just don't package 4 of them anymore.  Irregardless, they are still really good.  My favorite is still the chocolate brownie.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was a place I've always passed driving up north from the desert floor of Phoenix to the mountains of Flagstaff.  It wasn't until someone had recommended it that I stopped by on my way home one recent trip.  Not only because of the recommendation but from the throngs of people waiting to get in could I tell that this was a popular stop.  \n\nThere were plenty of pies to choose from.  All of them looked delicious.  On my first trip I happened to pick up some of the Turtle Brownies.  Not only were there four huge squares of them, they were moist, chewy, and very delicious.\n\nThis will be one place that I now make sure to stop by on my way back home from the mountains.  The difficult part will be choosing which pie or pastry to get the next time."
"2","I come from a long line of great piemakers. My grandmother sometimes made an apple pie a day. My family made plans to visit the cafe on our way home from Sedona and I kept telling myself to not expect too much. Restaurant pies are usually way over-hyped. We loved this place!!! The hostess was a real sweetie and Miles, our server, was flat out adorable. We sampled the rhubarb crumble, pecan, Tennessee lemon, and mixed berry crumble. My Mom and I felt we were the hands down winner with the rhubarb crumble. It was perfect, tart but plenty sweet enough, with a yummy crumble topping. We pride ourselves on our homemade pecan pie and the Rock Springs Cafe version was a serious contender. Plus the serving slice was huge. The mixed berry crumble was really good. The only one I wouldn't recommend was the Tennessee lemon. It was good but just not to my taste. It was like a lemon custard."
"2","Visited here last night for the first time after having known/heard about this place for years. 4 stars is strictly for the food which I thought was great.  There's a nice selection of classic comfort foods and \""western style\"" dishes.  I had the iron skillet steak.  Basically a skirt steak cooked in a skillet with onions and peppers and topped with cheese (sort of like fajita style steak).  Nothing earth shattering but a nice comfort style dish that hit the spot.  Although, I have to say it was pretty much like a fajita, which made me want tortillas to eat with it.\n\nI had a glass of their home made root beer.  Very smooth and creamy.  And of course the pie!  I had the JD PECAN pie (basically pecan pie cooked with Jack Daniels).  Probably the best pecan pie I've ever had!\n\nNow as great as the food was, the service could use some work.  The servers were attentive to a point but missed a lot of details.  For instance, we had to ask for silverware and napkins!  It would have been nice if the server mentioned a few of the special \""items\"" that they offered.  For instance, the server offered us \""iced tea or Pepsi\"" and not the root beer (which I did not notice on the menu until after I finished my soup).  Also, when we ordered pie, she did not offer to bring us any whip cream.  It wasn't until she offered me some for my daughter that I even knew they had homemade whipped cream!  So being that it was my first time I didn't know a lot of the nuances, maybe its one of those places that you just have to know how to order.\n\nAnyway, the food was great and I will be coming back to this place again since its only 15 minutes from Anthem!"
"2","The food and service are good just that a couple of weeks ago during that freak cold spell, the one waitress kept leaving the door open to the outside patio-----------brrrr! \n\nThough I'd definitely go back there to eat."
"1","All I wanted is some pie, and she wouldn't give it to me.....\n\nNo, seriously. I was the easiest and best type of customer a business just dreams about. I knew what I wanted, and I all wanted to do is paid for it and leave - simple.\n\nSo I went inside and I grabbed the apple pie and started to look for the pumpkin pie - couldn't find it. I finally located a worker...\""I am off the clock\"" he said and walked away. OK. I spotted another....\""I will be right back\"" she said and walked off, never to be seen again. I manage to find the pumpkin pie, but it was the behind the display case - the kind that employee reach in to retrieve the pies. I started to look around for help again, no one to be seen. By the way, this was sunday afternoon with several customers inside. I heard some workers in the back room and they saw me, but chose to ignore me. At that point I should have just left, but all I wanted is some damn pie. So I went around the counter, reached in for the pie, grabbed it, took it to the register, paid for it and left.\n\nWHY MAKE BUYING PIE SO DIFFICULT?\n\nAnyway, the pies were good, little pricey but good, not spectacular. Although it got me thinking. With the employees that care so little, how much love did go in to making that pie. Would they care if they dropped some filling on the floor. Would they pick that back up and put it back in the pie. I have never seen that a work ethic this bad. \nI hope that management gets their act together and actually manages their employees."
"2","You must stop at this cafe! it's a must must must! You must make the trip from Phoenix! Shopping in Anthem? Even better! I've been coming here for 10 years, and boy, has it changed! But one thing remains the same - best pies in the whole dang state.\n\nIt used to be a little hole-in-the-wall that was never busy... now they're expanded and are slowly creating (what I believe to be) a pie and dessert empire! More often, on weekends, you will find yourself waiting for a table, but don't worry, there's plenty to look at! I will be honest, I am used to some traditional \""diner\"" service, with waitresses that don't usually want to give you the time of day - but on my last visit, I had the kindest, smiliest, most affirming waitress I think I've ever had! \n\nI'm always torn about what pie to order when I come - Jack Daniels pecan? One of the amazing berry crumb pies? A foot-tall coconut cream pie? Well, this past time I chose the JD Pecan, and got a fist-bump from my waitress. It was a great choice, indeed."
"1","Not too peachy!!\nRock Springs Cafe and store is a cool place to stop in and visit on your trip north of Phoenix on I-17. Only being 20 minutes north of Phoenix it serves as an interesting \""slightly out of town\"" quaint, rustic atmosphere cafe. Well, I stopped in the other day to pick up a pie as a treat to take to my folks. I was sorely disappointed to pay $20 for a peach pie that is FAR from peachy. This place is supposed to be well known for their pies and I understand it is out of season for peach pie, but if you are going to sell one for that kind of money it should be something to talk about.\n\nPS..After driving by and seeing the extremely distasteful billboard above the restaurant for 1-17 traffic to see, I downgraded my review to 1 star. EXCUSE ME, BUT IF YOU NEED SEXUAL INNUENDO 'S TO SELL PIE, YOU BETTER RE-THINK YOUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAKE YOUR PIE WORTH DRIVING AND STOPPING FOR."
"2","Pie area separate from restaurant, great staff, great pie selection and taste! Will be stopping by again."
"1","We went out with the Central AZ Jeepers the other night to do a night run of the Maggie Mine Trail.  The plan was to start up at Bumble Bee, come south to Black Canyon City, then finish at Rock Springs Cafe for dinner and pie.\n\nFirst I have to mention we had a party of over 20 Jeeps and the trail is mostly visible from 17---we must have looked so cool, snaking along the mountain, our chair of headlights glowing in the night.  So if anyone took video...\n\nSo I was looking forward to Rock Springs Cafe.  We have driven past it a million times, but for one reason or another, never got the chance to stop in.  Finally!\n\nOur organizer, Cheri, had fixed it up with the Cafe that they were going to get invaded by 30-some Jeepers, so there was seating when we got there.  Parking, not so much.  They were having some sort of party at an outdoor venue down below---it looked fun.  Good music!\n\nWe were with DS and DSGF and they decided they were just going to hang out in the parking lot and listen to the music, because sometimes teenagers are weird.  But that put the kibbosh on a relaxing meal followed with pie, so I can't comment on the food.  But I insisted DH and I go in for some of that famous pie and coffee.\n\nIt took a bit to get some service, but we had walked in with thirty-odd people, so no dings for that.  The coffee was good!  Hot and fresh!  I ordered the coconut meringue pie and DH ordered the JD pecan pie.  My pie was a mile high, had a good coconut flavor but was a tad sweet for my taste.  But I don't like super-sweet stuff.  I tend to cut back on the required sugar when I make desserts.  But it was very good.  Someone commented in another review they thought the crust was store-bought.  Maybe.  DH liked his bite of my pie.\n\nI liked DH's pecan pie.  DH liked it, but he said mine is better.  (I make mine with chocolate chips and kahlua---go big or go home!)  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes to get our server's attention to get our check, which came to about $12 for two slices of pie and a cup of coffee.  She muttered something at us when she gave us the ticket---I didn't quite catch it.  So after about five minutes of sitting at the table waiting for her to come back, we took the ticket and cc and went to the gift shop to pay.  We stood there for several minutes waiting for someone and then a girl showed up and said: oh, no, you don't pay here, you have to pay your server.  (Oh, that must have been what the server was telling us!)  So we went back in to the counter and found our server.  She took our ticket and the cc, and then started messing around on the POS and I swear we stood there for ANOTHER seven or eight minutes while she entered some orders and helped another server with a question.  Then she took our money.  So, basically, we spent more time trying to pay our bill than eating our pie!  LOL!\n\nSo, it was an okay experience.  I'd probably go back if there was a group vote to do so, but I don't think DH and I would stop on our own volition.  I liked DH's pie better than mine and he liked mine better than his, but we both agreed that the cup of coffee we shared was very good.  Definitely, management could do a better job on customer service.  But you see a lot of this: management thinks they are \""saving money\"" by not having enough staff to take care of customers graciously and with efficiency, and then people stop coming because of the inadequate service.  Such is the way of the world!"
"2","We only stopped to get some pie and were so happy we did. I had cherry and my husband had blueberry crumble and we were in pie heaven. We will definitely come back again in the future."
"2","Some of the best pie in the state! We make a special effort to visit whenever we take a trip down to Phoenix, specifically for one pie: their Jack Daniel's pecan pie. You may have seen it featured on TLC's \""Best Food Ever,\"" and man, is that a great label or what.\n\nTheir regular pecan pie is amazing, but the JD pie has a hint of spice in it as well, and it's absolutely worth the slightly higher price. I can't recommend it enough!"
"2","Breakfast was great. Crispy bacon, eggs done right and coffee refilled without having to ask. Waitress was pleasant and friendly."
"1","Thee worst BK I have ever been to!!\n\nThe burger was so over cooked that it tasted like the smell of cow manure!!... I couldn't even dare finish my burger."
"1","I have heard how great this place was, so thought I would give it a try.  I have to say that the Green Chile Cheese Crisp is amazing, so simple and add some of their great salsa it is a winner.  However that being said, the place was a mess!  We were ignored the first 15 minutes we were there.  The restaurant is DIRTY. the tables the floors the walls just gross dirty.  The health department should shut them down just for that, can't imagine the kitchen!  If you were a fan of the tv show Will and Grace, you will be happy to know that Rosario has found work here, and she is just full of mean, no funny!  The food was bland, there was no seasoning at all that I could tell and it was all so mashed together on my plate I wasn't even sure what I was eating.\n\nBrave it Once for the Green Chile Cheese Crisp then find a place that has some flavor, and that is clean!"
"2","First of all BIG shoutout to Joseph.  He is my man.  I love their food.  You can't go wrong with a number one combo, or a GCC, or both.  I have never received bad service there, they are GREAT!"
"1","I stayed at this Hotel on 10/8.  We checked in about 3am, after almost falling asleep at the wheel.  I was advised the cost of the room was $69 + taxes, but when we went to check out they had added on an additional $32. not advising me of the charges.  It wasnt until I looked at my bank statement did I see the charges.  While we slept someone broke into our truck and stole a very expensive printer and the clerk refused to look at the camera to see who it might of been that stole it.  I called the owner Mr Shamsher Singh and  he advised me I had signed for the extra charges one being the charge for having pets in the room. And also told me he wasnt responsible for the theift. At check in I was never advised of the charges nor was I asked if I had pets.  I feel its the responsiblity of the check in clerk to advise the customer of the charges before they sign the papers."
"2","I've been here two times. The first time was really good, but the second was very boring flavored. I had some lemon chicken that was mediocre.  \n\nFor the price,  the last time turned me off, but will probably go back again."
"2","My girlfriend, her sister and I decided to visit Bella Luna for a nice dinner. Our first impression was it was a small, nicely decorated restaurant. From the get-go, we were kindly greeted by the owner, seated promptly, and cared for right away. Our server, Nicole, was such a great host! She took care of us quickly but still gave us enough space to feel like were not being rushed. \nWe had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, which was delightful and so fresh. \nOur main courses were fantastic. I had the Angel hair pasta with shrimp, my girlfriend enjoyed her egg plant parmesan and to be honest I can't remember what her sister ordered but it was delicious as well. \nWe ended the night with NY style cheesecake and it certainly hit the spot. \nMy impressions of any restaurant are greatly influenced by customer service. Good food is obviously a must I care so much more about being treated well and being taken care of. Bella Luna did both for us. \n\nWe normally don't visit the same restaurant twice since we enjoy trying new places. But we will be back!"
"1","Went there for the first time yesterday for a quick glass of wine and an appetizer @ 4:30pm.  Thought they may have a happy hour, but they didn't.  So my husband and I ordered 2 glasses of pinot noir and a shrimp cocktail.  The wine tasted old and the shrimp cocktail consisted of 4 large shrimp with tails (cold) and 2 large shrimp no tails (warm).  Hmmmm....I've never been served warm shrimp for shrimp cocktail....makes me wonder if the two shrimp with no tails were perhaps intended for a different menu item.  The bill was $40.  I don't see us returning any time soon."
"1","Wow, the wait at the drive-thru is painful in the heat!  Even with the air-con. \n\nI don't know if because it was extremely hot and humid that this wait seem to take forever.  But prior to going through the drive-thru, we had parked on the other side of the building and I walked to the other side to use the restroom, taking my casual time.  By the time I returned the same car was still at the drive-thru.  And when we finally made our order and received it, it seemed as though it was too long to wait for a drink.\n\nTake caution:  there are quite a few homeless hanging in the area."
"2","My hubby and I went there for the first time tonight for our anniversary. Food and service were great. Their margarita was fabulous. Can't wait to go back"
"1","The most rude, unprofessional staff i ever encountered. The products from this company are made cheaply & they do not stand behind their product. My hubby bought a pair of expensive glasses because this is the only place his insurance covered. Within 4 months, the frames were chipping, the glass from 1 of the lenses even chipped. He NEVER dropped them, although this establishment accused him of doing just that. EVEN THE LAB AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS!! Will never go into another store again. I suggest you do the same."
"1","Packed lines so messy I walk in I walk out"
"2","I got a white chocolate mocha yesterday during happy hour. It was pretty busy so I wasn't expecting anything special. I don't know what the barista did with my drink but he's a freaking wizard. I swear it was the best white chocolate mocha I've ever tasted! Usually Starbucks is just kind of \""okay\"" plus a butt ton of sugar that makes it good but my drink tasted like heaven.\n\nThe only thing that I didn't like was the bathrooms. They were a nightmare. I don't know HOW because I've never even seen mud in AZ but there was mud all over the floor (Maybe it was poop idk). I don't really care about that kind of stuff but it IS a business and that's not very respectful to the customers."
"1","Pretty rude telling us to wait and then on top of it they do not accept the Starbucks cards here.  We walked out....too bad cuz we are gold card holders too.  Will not return to this location based on the rude service alone.  Across the street is a much friendlier location\n\nI am reviewing the Starbucks inside the Barnes and Noble.....terrible"
"1","Not the best Starbucks in the land. The people are friendly enough but they have made our drinks wrong on multiple occasions. Also, they get their deliveries through the front door and the shop is essentially a long hallway so if you are there in the evening, prepare to have lots of material rolling past you. One of the delivery men even dumped a few boxes on a customer last time I was there. They do have some nice outdoor seating with misters but it is right on the corner of a parking lot so it's usually loud."
"1","The hostess are terrible and need to work on their customer service skills, our waitress did the bare minimum and the food left something to be desired. This is the second bad experience at this location. I will not be coming back"
"1","One word: Assault.  Two words:  Charges pending.   \n\nDo not go to this bar.  The bouncer assaulted my best friend--I would hate to think it is because he was a gay male on the Westside of town but no other reasons come to mind."
"1","Came in Saturday, a little after 5:00, very few customers and plenty of staff. We sat for several long minutes before they finally figured out who would serve us. The food came quickly, and was hot but just adequate. The lobster ravioli tasty fishy and the chicken was dry. It had been a long time since we had been to a Macaroni Grill. We see no reason to rush back."
"1","This place is very unorganized.  I will not be back.\n\nWe had to ask twice to get menus.  The pre-meal bread was cold.  Got the beverage near the end of the meal. They were out of the entree that my guest ordered. It took them 15 minutes to realize that and let us make another selection.\n\nThe sauce on the pasta I ordered was disgusting.  It tasted only slightly better than Chef Boyardee. \n\nAvoid this place and go to a better restaurant  ..."
"1","Wait time for table: Perfect, no wait.\nHostess: Raven, awesome. \nBread: Yummy.\nServers: Friendly, forgetful. Never saw a manager to back them up out front.\nSpeed of service: Slow. \nTaste of food: Didn't really matter, lost appetite.\nWould go back: No."
"1","Dropped in for a quick bite on Sunday evening. Sat at the bar. After 10 min and the bartender being busy doing other things, we walked out. Won't be back!!"
"1","-An acceptable chain restaurant to take \""out-of-town\"" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.\n\n-Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any \""...Berto's\"" type place in the Valley!\n\n-Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.\n\n-$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.\n\n-Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from \""salsa breath\"".\n\n-Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?\n\n-Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.\n\n-Parking is plentiful.\n\n-Separate entrance in the back for take-out."
"1","From the outside and the ads I would have thought this place would have been great...service was good...food and beverages were lacking. My glass of sangria was a fail...the smallest glass of sangria I ever had. It was almost like a small glass of red wine with a piece of fruit thrown in as an after thought. My chili rellano was a fail. The pablano pepper wasn't even cooked all the way and the cheese wasn't melted. We will not return again."
"1","Worst service ever! The bar tender was soooo rude. It's not my business if you enjoy your job, but the least you can do is fake it! Cold food, rude service... With so many choices in the area I will go else where for sure."
"2","I can't understand all the negative reviews for Macayos in Goodyear. YES, for those that don't already know this, Macayos is a chain. It's a family owned chain and as far as I know, they're only here in Arizona, centered around the Phoenix area. They've been in business many years.\n\nMy family loves Macayos, and we've been to several. I just ate at the one in Goodyear today for lunch - I had a colleague in from out of town and he was up for some Mexican food, and he said he enjoyed it. We both had the Chimi Macayos, with shredded beef, rice and beans (lunch comes with one or the other but you can add the other for a buck or two). \n\nTheir chips are good, the salsa is good (not great, I admit, but good) and they serve portions large enough to satisfy any hunger. Seriously, if you eat here and leave hungry, you're one in a thousand.\n\nThey have a nice bar area, and on Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty busy. The dining room is good sized and they can accommodate large groups. Which is good, because we often go there with a dozen or more family members.\n\nThey also have a very good line of margaritas, by the way."
"2","Why oh why don't they have a Cracker Barrel in Califonia??!!  My friends and I were in the Phoenix area this weekend and this was first on our list to eat!  We were excited to eat our breakfast here!  We also love browsing through the country store and sitting outside in the rocking chairs.  I hope one day this chain will expand to the Pacific Coast."
"2","As far as fast food goes they do well; never a long wait, employees are friendly, and orders are correct."
"2","The Menu is rediculous, everything from pancakes to fish tacos, portions are huge and is a good price, I suggest the chicken wrap...yum!"
"1","This \""restaurant\"" is, quite possibly, the worst place I have ever eaten - and I've traveled through Arkansas, so that's saying something.  \n\nThe waitress was only mildly interested in being there, and our dining experience only went downhill from there.  The food was among the most mediocre I have ever eaten.  The BBQ sliders (dry pork with a drop or two of sauce and some cole slaw) I got for an appetizer were barely appetizing.  My entree was an 8-oz sirloin (because, at 6:00 on a Tuesday, they were out of the only other cut of steak on the menu), which was completely without flavor.  Ordered with grilled onions, it arrived with mushrooms on it, and when I sent it back for grilled onions, it came out covered in raw onions that had been dropped on the grill for less than 10 seconds.  The accompanying beer-battered onion rings were uninspiring, as were the steak fries. \n\nAnd the atmosphere - it is very hard to describe.  The decor is ambitious and has some potential - but it needs people to liven it up.  It won't, however, get people with the lackluster food and service.  Generally, the place seemed like an old adult book store where someone decided to serve food."
"1","This is a great place to get your dog's groomed if you can get them in, the wait for an appointment is ridiculous. It's almost worth the extra price to get them in sooner. :("
"1","Walked in and everyone was busy.  We patiently waited, un-acknowledged, for 5 minutes.  Then three other people walked in and were seen before us."
"1","This place is a terrible value.  For $9 my burrito better be good, huge or both.  At La Loma it was neither.  There is no kids menu so I even over paid for my children.  Top it all off with an order at the counter and eat off Styrofoam experience and there's no reason to go back.\n\nI really liked the owner's old place, Arturo's, but La Loma has none of Arturo's great qualities.  We knew we had to try La Loma, now that we have, we'll never go back."
"1","Outstanding salsa!  They bring the pico and salsa separate so you can mix your own to taste and they are generous with both... \n\nGreen chili beef nachos.... Mmmmmmmm, so yummy!  So huge! \n\nNegro Modelo... Perfectly cold!\n\nNext time we find ourselves at The Old Pueblo Cafe, this is what we will order and nothing more because this was the highlight... Downhill fast after our appetizers... \n\nMomma had Sonoran Enchiladas and thought they had no real flavor or heat... She tried adding some salsa but it did not help, they were just too bland to be helped.\n\nThe Main Man had Mexican Flag Enchiladas and found cold spots within the warmth... What the heck?  His refried beans had whole, hard, crunchy beans among what looked like old, crusty mush... What the heck?  Overall, he says his plate was bland as well.\n\nI had a fish taco and relleno with rice and beans.  The tortilla for the taco arrived already saturated with moisture and falling apart... I discarded it and was left with my hunk of cod, cabbage, lettuce, and sauce... Still tasty but more of a salad than a taco.  The relleno gave me fond memories of La Union Station; if you've been you know what I'm talking about, if you have not... Sorry... My beans had appropriate consistency and I liked the rice just fine for the few bites I took.\n\nThe service was efficient and pleasant for an extremely busy Sunday afternoon during the big art event but when most of the main dishes are sub-par, I can't go higher than 2 stars... Stick with the salsa, nachos, and beer and have a 4-5 star experience!"
"1","Steer clear from their fish tacos! They were absolutely horrible!  The side of rice and beans were tasteless! Chips and salsa were good and that was it!"
"2","Great experience! The staff was making sure everyone was well taken care of.   Food was amazing, hot and came out fast.  We're definitely coming back."
"1","Not impressed at all. It was $25 for a men's haircut. Lupe took a mere 12 minutes to cut and she didn't even do beginning shampoo. I could have got a much better and inexpensive cut at Great Clips. This was my second haircut here and my last. If you're male, do your hair and pocketbook a favor: don't go to Haircutters in the Park.\n\nBy the way, they don't like to put tips on credit cards. That's a telling sign that this place is not as high-class as they claim to be."
"1","Burger was thrown in the box and the entire thing was overlooked. Never go here"
"2","This zoo beats the Phoenix Zoo hands down. Look for a 2 for 1 coupon in Hickmans Eggs. I went this past weekend for the first time since they added the aquarium. The aquarium is HUGE and consists of 3 different buildings. The giraffe feeding exhibit is awesome and was my kids fave. Bring quarters for the food machines. They had 1 huge giraffe that just loved all the attention and 2 smaller ones extending their necks out trying to get food. They were sooo cute. We saw a little joey in a pouch of a kangaroo, and we got to feed the lourey birds at 3. The petting zoo was alot of fun too. The Phx Zoo does not have this much interaction at all. Only thing missing was an elephant but we got to see the huge rhino up close, he was only about 20 feet away. The zoo could use some better food vendors..the food is not impressive unless you like nachos, pretzels, etc.. but overall we had a great time. Cannot wait to go back."
"1","Anyone driving out here for the first time should know that once you exit the highway, there aren't any gas stations. I nearly ran out of gas because I didn't know I was gonna end up way out in the boonies. I mean, where do all the farmers out here get their fuel?\n\nAs for the zoo itself, there are some animals that you won't see at the phoenix zoo and of course there's the aquarium but I don't really think I'll be going back. The reason I came here to begin with was so my girlfriend could see some penguins. I have to remind myself that we do live in the desert but the penguin exhibit was really sad. It's very small and although the entire front of it is glass, the entire area quickly fills up with children, obstructing the view.\n\nI think instead of driving from the east valley, next time I'll make the trek up to Out of Africa, which I've heard is quite an experience."
"2","A great place to go see some pretty cool animals!! Make sure to feed the lorrys during their feeding times. Its pretty cool. The Dragon World exhibit is really cool too. Tickets are pretty expensive. $16 for just the zoo and $31 for the zoo and aquarium."
"2","I visited when it was over 110 degrees and almost had the whole place to myself.  There are a lot of animals to see in the zoo and plenty of fish to see in the aquarium.  Be sure to go to the (free) bird feedings and pet the sting rays!  \n\nSee the zoo animals first because the zoo closes before the aquarium.  Bring plenty of water with you because this place is bigger than it appears.  There are a few water fountains near the buildings (north side of the park) with ice cold water that taste good, so you can refill a bottle there.  The water fountains on the south side are in the sun and hot.  The restrooms are large and pretty clean too.  One thing I didn't like was cups and plastic (water) bottles all over the place.  Clean up the trash.  \n\nThere is a great restaurant called Dillions BBQ on site and provides a great place to get out of the sun, soak up some A/C, and chow down on some really good food.  You can even request to sit right next to a giant shark tank!  \n\nThe aquarium's A/C is set in the mid 70s, so these are buildings that are nice to see when it's real hot.  Bring walking shoes, water and sunblock.  Also, enjoy the free air show that the fighter jets from Luke Air Force base seem to put on as they practice overhead."
"1","Let me first say, that I have worked at a zoo and my entire educational life is devoted to animal behavior and physiology, therefore my critic of each and every animal park I visit is a little more intense to say the least.  Firstly, this is a private owned zoo and I know a few people that work or have worked here and believe me the so tires i hear is not pretty, but that is another story entirely.  This chapter is about my visit to the park.  I tried to leave as much bias judgement aside, since my girlfriend was with me and I didn't want to ruin the trip for her (well she told me not to).  The Zoo itself is well organized, clean, and can experience everything in one day. Here's the bad news; all the mammal exhibits are incredibly boring and small providing almost no enrichment for the animals.  The reptiles exhibits are extremely out-dated, albeit they are a wild selection of herps; their exhibits make me feel depressed for these animals.  This is a zoo that shows really easily that ones an area is built, it is no longer taken care of, instead just building on the next big thing.  There is a shining star in this review however, the aquarium is nice, they need more variety (there predator room as green iguanas in a huge enclosure.. GREEN IGUANAS!! HERBIVORES in a PREDATOR AQUARIUM!)..ugh pardon me... Given the small amount of choices you have to visit here in arizona, they do have penguins (oh yeah).. this aquarium severely trumps az sea life and any other faux aquarium we may have in this state.\n\nin conclusion, i ranted too much.  It's a zoo, go outside, visit it, enjoy nature and see cool animals.  Downside..there are many many many many better zoos out there."
"2","I had to much fun going! I'm not much of a zoo person and prefer conservation centers more because I feel like the enclosures at most zoos are too small for the animals. This place had very wide open and big enclosures for most of the animals and I really enjoyed that. I would come back again!  They have an almost pure white tiger and a white lion, those are both pretty rare cats and it was worth admission just to see these beautiful cats. Most, if not all of the animals were out to see. \nThe only few complaints I would have about this place is the soda machines are almost all out of order, there isn't a whole lot of signs around to tell you where certain exhibits are. The jaguar seemed agitated and I felt horrible for him and couldn't find any water for him anywhere and he was warm and panting. Also some of the rides were down that should've been working. \nAll in all I would come back here again, but maybe in the winter when the weather cools down. Be ready to do some walking if you go to this zoo because its huge and there's a lot to see. The aquariums were beautiful and so were the fish."
"2","I take my vehicle into Wilhelm for oil changes and necessary car repairs. I have always found the front desk and mechanics to be extremely helpful and friendly. My family and I are natives and have always taken our vehicles to Wilhelm. I wouldn't think of going any other place. I would HIGHLY recommend to them to anyone!"
"2","Took a motorcycle ride today, ended up out by the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant (oooh, aaah) and landed at the Tin Top Bar & Grill for lunch and beverages!  Um, YUM.\nHad a most excellent chicken-fried steak sandwhich, nicely put together with just enough fries to make it a good lunch!  Good Service, Cold Beer, Good selections on the Menu.  Too Bad its about 80 milles from our house."
"1","You must be joking! Do more-save more. How about, waste more time. They have employees running all over, not in their perspective departments and acting like a discount store greeter. That is IF and WHEN you can find one. What is even more appalling is the management. If you ask to speak with one, it takes them 15-30 minutes to saunter over and act like their title really means they have a brain (poor scarecrow). Good employees who you can count on don't last. And what is with the product being hidden in the depths of the abyss that takes an hour to find and bring down. Why doesn't senior management listen to the complaints of the employees. Service sucks"
"2","Played here last week- was fun! Staff is super friendly and the proceeds went to a homeless shelter and soup kitchens. My hubby had never played bingo before but he enjoyed himself and wants to go back before we end our vacation"
"1","This place is right around the corner from my house and my fiance and I always take our vehicles here for washes and oil changes. It feels like this place has gotten progressively worse over the last year. This last time was the final straw. We brought both of our vehicles in last Saturday. He needed an oil change and a car wash and I just needed a wash. We waited in the filthy waiting area with the torn and stained furniture and when my car was ready it looked like it hadn't even been vacuumed and there were water spots all over it. We left to run errands before my fiance SUV was done. When we came back he went in to pay and there were additional charges. When he asked what they were for he was told that he need an extra quart of oil. He asked how many quarts were put in and was told 5. He told the girl that the engine was only a 4 quart engine. She looked confused and just stared at him. He told her that this was the last time that we would bring our vehicles there and she didn't seem to concerned. Needless to say we will be finding another place for car washes and oil changes. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Pay the extra couple of dollars and go elsewhere."
"1","I went here with my fianc\u00e9 and we both ordered the steak omelet. His came out filled with steak and all the goodness it comes with, mine came out with literally 3 pieces of steak. When I questioned them about it they has 2 managers come tell me that the steak is all pre-weighed and that is what it comes with. I pointed out my finances plate vs mine and stated that if I'm paying the price for the steak then I want steak! They ended up bringing me a side of stake bits after about 20 min and were very rude. I will not go back there!"
"1","Yesterday 3/18/2014 we went to 2007 Nails. The shop was unusually busy I thought, with more than 4 people waiting. We had 4 pedicures and 2 full sets. I got my nails done with a guy who didn't tell me his name. He did not put a top coat or offer to put gel top coat on my White tips. I had to wait for a free pedicure chair. Which I really didn't mind. \n\nMy mom sat down with Cindy to get the same style of tips I got, white tips with clear acrylic overlay. First thing off the bat, Cindy used the drill and nicked the skin on my mom's pinky on the left hand, then my mom had to ask her to use antiseptic liquid on the wound? (Cindy should have taken the initiative to do this?) As Cindy started my mom's full set she proceeded to glue the tip to the skin of my mom's other pinky. My mom said that the tip was glued to her skin and Cindy pitched a fit, yelling in Vietnamese and then took off the tip. She said \""You not happy, I not do your nails\"".  How can anyone be happy with a tip glued to them? An open wound created by the nail technician? \n\nI opted not to get my pedicure, because of this unkind act by the nail technician. It's not my mom's fault the glue ran under the tip and adhered to her skin. My mom is a senior 73 years old and she was treated like dirt in this salon. \n\nIt's quite obvious Cindy was already out of sorts before she started on my mom. I am at a loss to this type of behavior. Non-seasonal customers like us, make sure your business stays operating. However, we will not come back.  \n\nFacility: Is nicely kept, there is refreshments for you, if you so wish. (They need to dust the cobwebs off the front glass at the top by the ceiling). \n\nPrice: Out of sight for a basic pedicure!"
"2","Visited this place before getting coffee. I had a plain bagel with cream cheese and my husband had their pretzel bunned hot dog. We were both satisfied, and will definitely come back again."
"1","This food is poison don't eat at any red lobster"
"1","I should have just lit $75 on fire then at least I would have enjoyed it better. Had a 20 minute wait even though the place was half full. It was lobster fest so I ordered the seafood feast, EVERYTHING was overcooked. Lobster was like rubber and the crab legs were so overdone the meat wouldn't come out of the shell. Never again Red Lobster never again."
"1","Food poisoning alert!  My husband and I both had It.  We called to let them know and they expected me to go to the ER and have a doctor's note! They wouldn't even refund our bill and after our gift card it was only $22. I guess it was worth it to them. They said they'd call me back for some unknown reason and never did."
"1","terrible conditions in prime time of year. mickey mouse layout. skip it."
"2","This was a great place to stay when I was in town for my grandmother's birthday. The whole family stayed there. The pool was amazing and the free breakfast they served was really good.\nThe rooms were huge and the bed was very comfortable."
"1","DO NOT GO TO THIS BAKERY!!!  THE STAFF IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE.  My father who is legally blind with diabetes went in and asked if he could possibly put in a special order for canolis made with splenda and then the staff started cussing and yell at him and told him to go somewhere else.  We will now go to Romanelis in Phoenix!!!  My daddy's bakery needs to be shut down!!!"
"2","Great selection of deserts and delicious items to take home for dinner.  I will be back. So nice to see a place like this in this area!"
"2","Have been coming here for years ...... as good as it gets if you are not from New York and have enjoyed the real deal from Artuso's in the Bronx. My favories are the Black and Whites, Canolis, and the rainbow cookies. Also have a great canoli cake as well."
"1","They literally got every single part of my order wrong except for the drink.  \n\nI drove through about 15 minutes before close.  Not unreasonably last minute.  But everything looked shut down.  I ordered a burger with no bun because I have a wheat intolerance.  Right away the person taking my order seemed baffled.  \""No fries?\""  \""No, no bun.\""  Ok.  I tried to order a broccoli cheese potato because I know some Wendy's have this or use to have it, but they said they only had sour cream and chive or chili cheese.  No problem, I'll take chili cheese.  Then  a Jr. chocolate frosty.   \n\nThe first thing he handed me was the frosty.  It was vanilla.  I had to wait until the order was finished about 5 minutes later before I was able to speak to him again and request a chocolate instead.  Then I glanced in my bag of food and the burger  clearly had a bun.  Okay I can't just remove the bun, because just the contact with the burger is enough for a reaction.  But honestly I was too afraid to ask them to remake it because by this time they were about 5 minutes till close and I was afraid they'd spit in it or something.  I'll just give it to my husband and the potato will be my dinner.  Then I got back to my hotel, got out the potato (with no fork or utensil) and it was a CHIVE potato.  No chili or cheese.  Just a dry potato with chives.  There wasn't even any sour cream on it or in the bag.  Great."
"1","The hubby and I were out running errands and time was flying buy, we were starving, and I have been on a constant craving for Italian subs (thanks Jersey Mikes!) so I said lets go to streets, we were in that shopping center anyway... I remembered about six years ago, a friend who worked there hooked me up with an Italian sub, and I remembered it being good. I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also... I didn't feel very skeptical. We were sat but it seemed like we were forgotten for a while, it took like ten minutes before our waitress came (there were only two or three other tables sat, and at least four servers there). I ordered the sub, hubby ordered medium wings. They brought the complementary bread and I realized it was about to be a sucky meal. The bread was old, the marinara was nasty. I got my Caesar about another ten minutes latter, it was also nasty, the dressing was like Kraft or something bottled and low quality, there was the most powerful BO smelling red onion slice on top. The wings and sandwich didn't take as long... The wings were like precooked Tyson frozen wings with some kind of weird glaze, flavored like buffalo sauce. It didn't even look like real wings. The sandwich was soooooooooooooo gross. The bread was gross, the dressing was flavorless... I hate spending money (yeah it wasn't that much, only a $20 lunch for two, but still...) on food that is nasty. Even the water was nasty. It makes me so mad! Only good thing, our waitress was nice.  We should have went to Greek Corner, where I know the food is GOOD!  Streets needs to make their food fresh to start improving..."
"2","I'm not a huge fan of NY style pizza (ok, I'm not a fan at all)... but I was pleasantly surprised by their pizza!  I mean, I'd still take a Chicago-style deep dish pizza over this any day of the week, but if I'm in the mood for thin crust pizza with a good combination of sauce, crust, and cheese, then I'll come back here!"
"2","Went out for dinner with the wife and two kids. The Pizza and chicken were both great. The garlic bread included with the meals as an appetizer is awesome. I have eaten here 3 or four times and each time has been consistently good. Prices are fair. \nWe will be back."
"1","Pizza was burnt and greasy. Passion bread was okay. Ordered take out hoping for a delicious NY style pizza and was severely disappointed. I won't be back."
"2","I love the staff at this store. They are the reason I keep coming back.  This store is usually very busy - however the employees take the time to talk to you, get to know what's going on and really build a relationship with their customers.  \n\nAny Starbucks can make you a drink - this Starbucks is more about the experience."
"2","I don't know why I ever come here more often. I love Chick Fil-A, love their food, love their service. Let me see! What do I want? How about chicken!!!! Chicken sandwich, chicken tenders, breakfast chicken sandwich and chicken soda?? I wish they had chicken soda!!!! Oh yea, their fries are not that bad either!"
"2","This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh, service is always outstanding."
"1","No GPS, No Map, Asked me for directions, I was scared and uncomfortable!\n\nI booked and prepaid for a shuttle from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to Surprise, AZ, at least one week prior to arrival.  You are required to give a phone number and address of destination.  One would think, this is because the route was mapped out, or put into a GPS prior to pick up.  Not the case!  I was picked up on April 11, 2014, by an elderly driver.  At pick up, he was friendly and helped me with my bags.  I was the only passenger in the van.  We proceed to move out of the arrival area of the airport and the driver asks if I know how to get to where I am going.  I think that this is a joke and kind of laugh, saying this is my third time here this year.  He says, good, do you know how to get there?  I say, not really don't you have GPS?  He says no.  I asked didn't the company print you directions from MapQuest or something?  No, is his response.  I say, they don't give you a GPS?  No, he replies I would have to buy my own, and I also have to buy my own maps, and the area you are headed is so new, it is not on my map.\nAs a frequent, traveler, Road warrior, I expect when I get into a cab / black car / van service that the driver has GPS, or knows the area.  As a female, this could be a very frightening situation.  I kept it in perspective, because he was elderly, but I was uncomfortable, and felt unsafe / unsure. I began texting the person, that I was meeting, for directions.  I then downloaded an app for MapQuest on my phone - did not have it, because my personal vehicle has GPS. The driver did not want to use the map quest directions I pulled up, making me even more uncomfortable and nervous. He did begin following directions provided to me, via text.  I was so nervous that I was continually texting someone telling them what we were passing and the road signs I was reading. Once we got close to Surprise, I recognized the area and directed him to the house I was going to.  The driver said, Glad one of us knew where they were going.  Not humorous, not even remotely acceptable!!  I did tip him, and was not confrontational about his lack of directions, because he new where I would be staying - I don't know this guy!\nThe person that I was visiting, who recommended Sun City Express was very upset.  She came out and spoke to the driver about lack of directions.  His response was, At least I got her here.\nWe called Sun City Express to speak to a supervisor and his response was, \""He got her there.\""  Again not acceptable.  He rambled on, that I needed to arrive at my destination quickly for a meeting.  This had nothing to do with the fact that I road 45 minutes with a man that did not have directions, and did not speak more than ten sentences after leaving the airport.  We explained that had he not been elderly, this would be even more frightening than it was.  The supervisor said this man has been with the co. a long time and refuses to use GPS.  Not the same story the driver gave me, and if you don't know where you are headed, and refuse GPS and maps, why are you driving people.  when mentioned to the supervisor that he did not even apologize, he then said sorry.  Too little, too late, and not professional or courteous, or empathetic.\nBeware, be warned, take heed, before allowing yourself to be put in the same situation that I was in.  I was scared."
"2","I recently sat on my sunglasses and desperately needed something so I ran into Target.  I bought some awesome sunglasses in the Optical section Reaction Kenneth Cole's; got great service from the Target Lady in the Optical dept.  She was so incredibly nice.  I am going to buy some fab prescription Rayban readers when I feel more flush.  :)\n\nUpgrading T's rating to four stars because their service seems way better!"
"2","Usual layout. Staff was friendly."
"1","I have lived in phoenix all my life and seeing as mexican food is one of the main dishes here it goes without saying that i have tried numerous places both good and bad. This unfortunately was a bad one, the flour tortillas and salsa were the best thing of the 2 dishes I tried. The beans though they were creamy and smooth seriously lacked flavor of any kind the rice was also just as bland as disappointing. The chips they serve when you first sit down are ok, but they only serve 1 basket free where 99% of other places will serve you as many as want. this isn't a huge deal but it adds to the experience. All in all it was not the worst mexican food ever it just didnt meet the standard that has been set by the south phoneix classics which are Carolina's, Poncho's, and Rito's."
"2","Love this place, eat here a least once a week.  Have brought many of our friends and neighbors, they also love Las Cazuelas, food is great, the margaritas are fabulous and if you tell them on the rocks light ice they do it, also senior discount of 10%, service can be slow at times because they are usually packed.  I don't understand the negative reviews from some of the other comments.  I give it 5 stars.  One of our favorites and we eat out a lot."
"2","By far my favorite theater and a world better than the UltraStar in Suprise.  I am also a fan of Harkins and choose them over AMC every time possible.  The ONLY thing that they really have to stay on top of is the roving packs of RUDE noisy teens that think the movie theater is the place to show how smart (read obnoxious) they are.  \n\nSeriously, you let people act like that and you will run off people with lots more disposable income that will go elsewhere.  Please keep the quality high, and manage the atmosphere.  You have a good thing here, but stay watchful for whether or not Harkins keeps it good."
"1","The hairdressers are all very young and inexperienced, with no older folk to guide them or show them how to cut hair.  I tried to explain how my ends need to be cut, but neither of the two employees had ever heard of such a thing.  I have had this certain type of cut from a few different hairdressers, and it's perfect for my type of hair.  I have had some other hairdressers insist on something else, and it always looks horrid.  I am open to certain changes, permutations, and differences here and there, but there is a specific way that the ends of my hair really need to be cut.\n\nSo anyway, the two kids get together and decide that I'm crazy, and they convince me to let them do it \""the right way\"".  I have to admit that it's my fault because it was Sunday afternoon, and I didn't feel like waiting for an appointment with a better establishment.  I just asked them to leave like an extra inch, just in case I needed to cut more to make it right.  They ended up giving me a very stupid-looking cut.  I actually had to cut it some more when I got home.  My home-cut involved standing backwards in front of a large mirror, holding a smaller mirror in my left hand, and using the scissors with my right hand.\n\nLuckily, the skill level of the hairdresser was so low that there was not much for me to mess up.  It's just a straight line across the back.  Nothing was done to the sides, and she did not create a shape of any type along the back.  I paid thirty bucks with tip for a straight line that goes right across my back.  I could have gotten my boyfriend to do it."
"1","We have enjoyed our previous visits to this Red Robin, but the last 2 trips have revealed inattentive servers.  Last night our food arrived via a manager, but we had no silverware or napkins.  As our server Brittany was no where to be found, we began our meal with fingers.  Finished our meal, dirty plates stacked on our table, along with empty drink glasses.  Britney walked by about 13 times, never once stopping to pick up dirty dishes or ask us if we needed anything.  We were never offered refills on drinks, fries, root beer floats.  Waited another 14 minutes for a check, again can't find Britney. We got up from our booth to start walking out of the restaurant, and Britney suddenly appeared with our check.   Not sure where the servers go to hide, but it must be a great place to hang out while your customers wait patiently for your return."
"2","We went here for open skate. Free parking and public skate wasn't too busy and a weekday. Skating was $12.00 with rentals. I got two free passes from a raffle yaaay!! The place is clean and the rink is big! Place is well maintained and looks new. Free parking and food restaurants across the parking lot :) Check the website for open skating times. http://www.polaricepeoria.com/page/show/46707-public-skate"
"1","Same thing. Poor customer service. They don't keep schedule. Simple oil change takes 5 hours and that happens with me twice. I dropped off my car on 10 am and was promises to have it back in couple hours. As I work in same shopping center And I told that I will come after my car at 3 pm when i finish my shift and I will need it by that time to get home. But I didn't receive any call at 3. That was my luck that the other employee got sick that day and I was have to take over her. I called them at 6 pm right before they close and asked about car. \""Oh, I was gonna call you. Your car is almost ready\"". I complained on such behavior and they did not even apologize."
"2","I was craving WAFFLES! Let's just say that when your tummy tells you, it wants something, give in. It'll save you countless calories eating other food and then having to get Waffles too. \n\nThis breakfast hub is perfect for those days when you want a cup of joe and the typical American breakfast. I had waffles with ham and hashbrowns. Yums! The server was nice and helpful. The place is clean... what more can you ask for??"
"2","Our server (David was his name) was fantastic. He was enthusiastic and friendly, tried to upsell (offered drinks vs. asking what we wanted, offered cheese on our eggs, etc.) and took the time to show us the changes to the new menu. Very helpful and cheery..honestly not what I would typically expect from a breakfast restaurant (usually the servers seem stressed and rushed). Food was good, as usual..but his service would have brought us back regardless!"
"1","I had a coupon from the RetailMeNot app, buy one entree, get one of equal or lesser value free up to $9, if you buy 2 beverages, yadda yadda. Only reason we chose to go to ihop for a late dinner. My husband ordered the recommendation from our server, banana waffle, and also got eggs and bacon. He asked for medium well eggs, and mentioned they usually come out too runny, to which our server said she would 'make sure they are more medium well'. Needless to say, they were barely cooked enough to hold their shape, hardly any coloring from being cooked and my husband couldn't eat them. The waffle wasn't that great either. I ordered the SW Club. Super dry!  Once the check came and I showed my coupon, the server left to check with her manager and came back and said they are no longer accepting offers on phones, they have to be a print out. There is nothing on the offer that says this and there isnt even an option to print through the app. I guess they can get away with this because of the fine print that says the offer is subject to change withput notice. Our server was friendly, otherwise it was not a good dining experience, even for an ihop."
"2","Just tried the Angel Hair Pasta with meat sauce and meat balls along with a small salad to take out, and it was delicious."
"2","Very helpful and knowledgeable staff."
"1","I really should have known better-being that I was spoiled in NJ with such fantastic italian food.\nOnce again, another restaurant (chain or family owned) that does not offer chicken francaise! What do I have to do to find some chicken francaise in AZ?!\nAnyway..food was bland-you have to order pasta seperately? really??? It's not included? what italian place doesn't give you a smidge of pasta? Even olive garden gives you some pasta!\nOh well..server was great, so I gave the extra star for the super waiter and I actually love all the kitchy stuff on the walls."
"1","Always ask if you want the tour or would you like to go directly to your table.  I have always been asked may we seat you in the bar?  Do not just seat someone into a very NOISY BAR.  Never have I ever been to a Family type serving restaurant them did NOT have an option of just a single serving.  Veal is free range veal that was bland, dry somewhat tough and tasteless.  Lasagna dried out, the edges were spongy as if the lasagna is precooked frozen and the reheated.  Nope not going back  eeewww yucky."
"2","We have been to the one in MN several times but this one is huge! Great food, service was a bit rushed but all in all a good place to be. Sign up for their email club before you go!"
"2","I am not a fan of family style dining (get your fork off my plate!) so it's not exactly what I would want to do. That being said the food was awesome. Price is on the high side and I didn't like that the young hostess didn't ask us before hand how we felt about eating upstairs or walking up steps when there was an elevator there. That is something that needs to be asked right away before seating anyone. My partner in crime didn't care for that either and service can be slow at times.\nI plan on going back due to the food and for that alone it gets 4 stars."
"1","My mom and I went to this location for a morning smoothie. I remembered seeing a groupon available and I bought it waiting in line to order for 5 for $15. When I ordered the cashier rudely told us they don't participate in Groupon's and offered no apology. On the door is a whole letter explaining they aren't accepting Groupon's. They need a sign simply stating \""Groupon's Not Accepted\"" because who is really going to read an entire letter while walking in? We spend over $17 for 3 smoothies. Plus the $15 for the Groupon. Of all the locations in the valley only 4 aren't accepting them. These locations should just be a part of the team and not give Jamaba Juice a bad name.\nThe smoothies are just ok and the staff looks miserable in silly hats they are obviously forced to wear. I won't be coming back again. I'll take my business to a team player location even after my Groupon's are used up!!!"
"1","It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.\n\nBut service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service. \n\nI wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place."
"1","How does an ice cream shop NOT have chocolate chip or mint chocolate chip for over two weeks! Come on -does someone need lessons in supply and demand? I only ask for ice cream every once in a while!"
"1","Went in at about 940pm. There were 4-5 people working and about 2 different guests eating. We were sat and told someone would be right with us. 20 minutes later and no one had come to say hi or take our order. All the employees were behind the counter talking and joking. We got up and walked up and will never return. What a horrible example of customer service."
"1","After walking in and not being greeted in any way I asked a cashier what the wait was like for a booth for two and her only response was to roll her eyes and say I have no idea but you can sit at the counter if you want. We waited and were finally seated by someone else. FIFTEEN minutes into sitting with our menus closed not a single person had acknowledged my wife and I yet every other table around us had been helped and had food. We finally walked out without being acknowledged yet again and went to IHOP where within five minutes of walking in we had our drinks at the table and food ordered. I know where my money is going for breakfast in the future."
"2","Not bad for a chain. I like that they have the peanuts. :)\n\nFor the celiacs... they have a gluten free menu!  I did not get glutened when ordering off that menu.\n\nThe steaks... PERFECTLY cooked.  It couldn't have been done better, and that's rare these days."
"1","Your contact form fails in any browser, none of the stores populate. No Arizona stores come up on your location search.\n\nFirst impression was great. Loved the peanuts at the door and on the table.  Hot rolls as soon as we sat down, great.\n\nNow the not so great.  Waited too long for water on a hot as heck day. Blooming onion burnt. Steak tasted like someone dumped a bucket of salt on it and it was over cooked.  Green beans mushy, watery and lacked flavor, even from the hard bits of what looked like bacon.  Ribs were only so-so.  Waitress forgot to being ketchup for my dad's fries.  Salads were just ok.  \n\nBased on this experience I won't be back again."
"1","I had never been to Sweet Tomatoes until today. I have been to Souper Salad many times before and I expected it to be similar but better.\n\nWell, I will start with the good.\n\nOkay and now the so-so. I had the chocolate bread muffin. It was tasty, and chocolaty, but dark chocolaty. Not sweet at all really. Like I said, it was good but as it was not sweet, it was not dessert, and as it was chocolate it didn't really go with anything else.\nI moved on to try the chocolate bread pudding concoction they had. That was REALLY good, but it was almost gone so I only got the edges. I got hardly any of the gooey chocolaty messiness that I truly wanted. This dessert probably would have been in the good category if I had gotten some 5-20 minutes earlier.\n\nAnd now for the bad. I'll just start from beginning to end. Raw beets = not good! Dry, stale spit most of my first bite out. The light ranch tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The regular ranch was watered down. They were out of Coke, Dr. Pepper and Rootbeer and only had ice at the cashiers station, not in the soda fountain. The Chinese orange happy chicken salad had no chicken and I was not happy! I moved onto the soups. First I tried the 3-cheese tortellini soup. I couldn't taste any cheese and the tortellini was mush.\nThe broth was flavorful but I still only had 3 bites. I moved on to the Irish Potato and Leek soup. It was pretty tasty actually but I still had to doctor it up with salt pepper and cream cheese because it was otherwise rather bland. I also took a bite of the chicken noodle soup. It had big chunks of chicken in it. Big, dry, overcooked pieces of chicken. It was also bland. Should have had some veggies in it. The mac n \""cheese\"" was soupy and also bland.\nYou won't catch me back here anytime soon!"
"1","So sad, so sad...  Another Sweet Tomatoes has changed over to a disaster-case \""Field Kitchen\"".\n\nEEK!     :-O"
"1","So we come from California where there is a lot of sushi to choose from and it is my favorite food so I have been searching for good sushi here this is not the place.\n\nAnyways the small amount of fish in my roll and the horrible service did not satisfy my craving and I will never go back it was like a sushi bar that was trying to be a dance club and the waiters were all very distracted by that. They never refilled our drinks anyways I finally found the perfect sushi place ill write a review for them later :)"
"1","Just go to Tokyo Lobby on 59th and bell. Better prices, happy hour, and by far better food. I was only going to Ah So cause it was cheap and all I knew about."
"2","This is our favorite Teppanyaki place, never has sushi at this location.  Expect to pay $25 for a typical entree.  We usually skip drinks to save $$$.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, good separation between the bar/sushi area and the cooking tables.  I never expect anything but average service from a Japanese Restaurant and this is no exception.  \n\nMost recently I had Scallops/Shrimp combo and it was delightful.  Scallops prepared excellent, not rubbery, can't say the same thing about the shrimp.  Daughter had chicken which always tastes a bit funny to me and son had NY Steak and wife opted for the Filet.  As a family we all love their fried rice as part of the entree' it's what keeps us coming back.  Miso soup was average and the salad was quite good.\n\nAs they say, we all left fat dumb and happy with some leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nFamily of four with tip, $115."
"1","the restaurant is a bit dark, most of the staff is blah. the food itself is okay... and overpriced."
"1","Just moved to the area and have never had a Bashas store in our Phoenix area. I have never encountered such rude and uncaring checkers in my life. I will drive extra miles to avoid this store and plan to meet with the manager face to face and tell him what I think. Safeway and Frys have much nicer people and better prices."
"1","I went to the drive through, picked up my food went down the road. I took a bite into the hamburger and the top bun was rock solid and could not even eat it. So I took the bun off and took another 2-3 bites and the Tomatoes were not tasting to good!. So I stopped eating the food as it was Not a Good Sign!"
"2","I have been to Firebirds many times and will continue to go.  It is a delicious steak house that has many other items that are great for the whole family.  We always start with the ranch rings. They are perfectly breaded and crisp and come with a garlic ranch dressing that everyone in my family loves.  Every time we go my daughter can't seem to get enough of the wood fired salmon.  The best part is that the salmon is on the kids menu so it makes it a little more affordable.  For dinner I have had the Firebirds Chicken Pasta, it was creamy and full of flavor.  Cilantro Grilled Chicken breast that was perfectly cooked with the parmesan mashed potatoes I couldn't get enough of the jack cheese sauce.  The Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon with mushrooms and bleu cheese was so good that when I was finished eating it I could only think that I wanted more.  My niece recently tried the Sesame Encrusted Salmon with the parmesan potatoes and fried spinach.  The salmon left the plate quickly between her and my daughter, who helped her eat it when her salmon was gone, the fried spinach was something of a mystery.  At first when the spinach enters the mouth there is a crunch and then it just melts away leaving a salty taste that soon disappears.  Odd yes delicious yes, it was great with the salmon, or at least my daughter thought so since I don't like fish.  Mr C got the Baby Back Ribs and enjoyed them making a perfect mess of himself.  They brought him a warm wet towel to help clean up, thank you.  The Chile Rubbed Delmonico has this delicious rub that makes the meat melt in your mouth.  The meat itself is very fatty which I normally wouldn't even try but the rub gave it a flavor that was worth the fat.  Everyone in the family has tried this and most everyone has ordered it at one time or another.  To finish the meal we always get the creme brulee cheesecake.  The crunch sugar top with the soft and creamy cheesecake and the graham cracker crust with blueberries and strawberries and a strawberry sauce makes this a beautiful end to a perfect meal.  We have never been dissatisfied and have always received great service. They have a great wine selection, with beers that satisfy my beer snob husband and coffees with liqueurs that help to end a meal on a high note. The price isn't bad for the food that you receive.  Take family or friends and enjoy a night out."
"1","***DON'T*** GO TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY.  I was floored! $135 in food for 4 people to celebrate my husband's B-day and they don't do anything, we would have gone to the Black Angus or CARVERS they are near the same area, just as delicious steaks *and* less money $!!  At least at those places we would get a candle in a brownie just so we could say that we had him blow out a candle for his b-day.  I can't justify $28 entries that do not come with a soup or salad in this economic climate, and NO hospitality, so even though the food is good we won't be returning because we really only go for special occasions go to Carvers or Black Angus or even Outback! Before we return here!"
"2","The daughter and I made another trip to Phoenix last week and we did what we always do while in AZ:  we tend to frequent a lot of chain restaurants and this is a chain that we had yet to try.\n\nWe came here with my Mom for a late lunch (after being picked up from the airport) around 2pm to a fairly empty restaurant. This place is land locked in between PF Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, Buco De Peppo, Elephant Bar, Red Robin and a slew of other fast and non fast food chains. \n\nOur waitress was really nice and we were all glad we brought in sweatshirts because like all AZ restaurants, it was freezing inside. The menu had a lot of great offerings and my Mom and I both chose wood-fired grilled salmon served with perfectly al dente veggies and for me, Parmesan mashed potatoes and Mom's with a baked potato. Daughter opted for some kind of salad with stinky cheese and a cup of their tortilla soup. We were also served fresh baked sourdough bread with cornmeal crust that had Kevin been with us, would have been replenished many many times. The bread was AWESOME. \n\nMy salmon was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I was super pleased with my meal (it was huge for lunch and at $14.00 including the large helping of fresh vegetable was better than my favorite chain salmon that only comes with rice and 5 or 6 snow peas). The daughter LOVED her salad (I didn't taste it due to the stinky cheese) and the soup was flavorful but thick like the kind Chili's serves and not in a good way. \n\nI would come back here in a heartbeat and avoid some of the other monstrosities  around."
"1","First I hate when people call it \""Cheesecake\"" as in, \""I am sacrificing a meal tonight and eating at Cheesecake.\""  Please...\n\nAnyways...\nI have pretty good memories of this restaurant from childhood because back then I guess I didn't realize that it was a chain.  When I was a youngster in Michigan, it was always special to go to The Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and wait your 2 hours for a table and la te da.  \n\nNow, I realize that it is just one of the billions of chains on 83rd that is just sub par.   The last time I was there we ate an okay meal but had to wave our waiter down for water refills and earlier in the meal when he was taking our order, he actually sat down next to me while my boyfriend and I were ordering.  BIZARRE!  The guy clearly couldn't read body language.\n\nHuge Menu\nHuge place\nLoud\nFood that is just okay\n\nI know you can do better..."
"1","I went there for lunch on my twenty first birthday and the food was delicious, service not so much. I don't know if it is because I am young and she profiled us as going to leave a small tip but we even dropped it was my twenty first a couple times and not even a happy birthday was said. I have gone with friends previous years to other locations and had meals partially paid for and desserts free and I know your not suppose to expect and I wasn't but this felt like horrible service and I was disappointed."
"2","We are quickly becoming regulars here. The patio is always nice even when it's 100 out due to the great misters and nice seating. Service is always great and they actually have a couple great healthy menu options now, the shrimp and spinach salad is probably one of the best salads I've ever  had! Lots of good beers on tap as well!"
"2","This place is delicious!  A friend recently introduced me to Greek Wraps and I have been there twice since!  The chicken shawarma is delicious.  The spice on the chicken is unique and a delicious unexpected addition.  I definitely recommend the wrap over the pita. If you have a hankering for Greek food this is the place to go!"
"2","Probably the best Gyros on the west side. They are a bit pricier than most other similar places, but it is worth the extra $1.50 for better flavor. I almost always stop by when I'm in the area."
"2","Awesome gyros!"
"2","UPDATE:   Soda now tastes delicious.  They must have put in a purifier."
"1","I have shopped at Old Navy for years. Never again. The store manager Aundrea Turner cost the company my business as well as the business of my friends and family. All over $9. \nThe whole thing started on Saturday when I purchased 3 dresses for my niece during the one day sale. I bought them at Colonnade. The sale was a one day sale on girls tank dresses for $7. The dresses were clearly marked $7 and there were a mix of solids and print. I bought 3 with prints.  The dresses I picked were all from the side of the display rack that had a $7 sign. They weren't just one or two mixed in there were full size runs. The other side of the rack had tunics for $8.50.  I was charged $10 each. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until this morning when I looked at the receipt. I live by Arrowhead and that's the location I went to for a price adjustment receipt and dresses in hand. I waited in line for 10 minutes before someone helped me. The cashier checked with whom I assumed to be an assistant manager or lead. I was told that the Arrowhead location didn't have this style (same style just a print instead of solid) on sale but they would call the location I went to for verification. I waited for nearly 10 minutes and in front of me the cashier told the same lead that the Colonnade location had put them on sale for $7 because they had such little inventory of the ones that were actually on sale. He then asked if he should just refund me the difference. She told him no and went to check with the store manager. After waiting another 5 minutes she came back and said if I wanted the price difference I would have to take it to the Colonnade store for a refund. I asked to speak with the manager. We waited 10 more minutes for her to come out. From the start she was defensive and rude. She told me that she called that store (because apparently she didn't believe the employee that had already called them in front of me) and told me that I was wrong they never had the dresses set up like that and if there was a mistake, it was that store's mistake and they would be the ones that needed to fix it not her. That's right. She said. Multiple times actually. I told her I am not driving 25 min to get a price refund and she said I can keep the dresses or return them. I asked for a refund and she told me to get back in line and walked off.\nThis behavior is completely uncalled for by anyone no matter what store it is or what their position is.\nThe price difference wasn't huge and I probably would have kept them. I was even planning on doing some more shopping. My mom even had several items in her hand and put them back.\nI won't ever be back."
"2","Been eating here off and on when I am on leave and visiting the family!\nTheir pizza and pasta is great! The service and staff are great also!! Anything you order off the menu you cannot go wrong!"
"2","I love this place. It's beautifully decorated and the service is excellent. I have been here a few times and each time was consistently great. They are more one the \""fine\"" mexican cuisine scale. They make an avocado mousse, that's like guacamole, only better. It's silky and creamy and oh so delicious. Their queso dip was excellent as well. Try their dip sampler it has the two I listed and one other. I've had a taco plate here and a quesodilla, both excellent."
"2","Love come here before on several occasions and been impressed with both the food and the service.\n\n This occasion was no exception. I came with my family and my mother. We were promptly greeted and seated. \n\nThe waitress didn't pressure us to order and encouraged us to take our time. We opted not to order appetizers since the chips and variety of salsas was plenty.\n\nThe choices of the night were the Monterey platter for mom, stuffed chicken medallions for me, the fajita chimichanga for my wife, and the taco and fries for my daughter.\n\nI must start with the kids taco. For once I can say that it was a taco that I was honestly impressed with and would have welcomed to eat myself.\n\nThe chicken medallions were quite good and I would certainly order them again. They were moist and cooked to perfection. The papas that accompanied them were also incredible. For once the rice at a Mexican restaurant was not only edible, but also different in a good way and tasty.\n\nThe Monterey platter was enormous and presented plenty of leftovers for the next day. My mom loved it. The only downside was the piece of plastic in the guacamole that she encountered. An apparent corner from the guacamole cream the add their avocados to when they make guacamole. Don't get me wrong, the guacamole is delicious. This was brought to managements attention and dealt with immediately and in a very satisfying manner with the apologies of the staff. I only include this bit to show how good the service is. \n\nThe fajita chimi looked good and must have been since my wife wouldn't let me near it.... jokes on her.... I'm attacking her leftovers tonight when she goes to sleep.\n\nThe meal itself was very satisfying and delicious.  The service was good and we will definitely return."
"1","This was good when it first opened but is now indistinguishable from the Americanized greasy spoon Mexican fare that you get everywhere else in Phoenix. \n\nPrices are okay, chips and salsa are included (and the chips are served warm) and the portions are enormous. But the food isn't particularly interesting, relying too heavily on fat and carbs and not enough on interesting flavors.\n\nEvery time I go, want Abuelo's to be a classy Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself through a refined Mexican palate not a substitute for Macayo's."
"2","Mr. Goodcents has delicious crisp subs. The meat and cheese are cut right in front of you and the bread is made fresh. The califonia sub is my favorite."
"1","I am usually pretty generous on my reviews, but considering I have been to this place a few times I simply find my overall experience average at best. It is undeniable that they have pretty good pizza and decent wings, but the customer service that I have always experienced here is just okay. I am not very demanding when it comes to customer service like some, but a smile here and there and appreciation for customers would be nice. Customer service goes a long way in my book, and I have found a couple other pizza joints that offer great customer service that I would rather frequent. \n\nWe arrived with a restaurant.com coupon that was purchased just a few days prior only to find that they weren't accepting them anymore. Hmmm, that wasn't very settling considering I bought a few of them. My question was, \""Why are they available for purchase if you are no longer accepting them?\"" Only to be told, \""Well, they shouldn't be on there anymore and they will probably be taking them off soon.\"" \n\nMeh... I think I can find better customer service with a smile at Grande Pizza just down the road where they make an effort to remember my name and greet with a warm smile."
"2","We had to stay here due to water damage in our house and it was great! We had a 2 bedroom suite with a living space and kitchenette. And every morning they serve breakfast in the lobby. Employees were friendly always greeting is when we came in or left. except one guy at night"
"2","Stayed here Last night October 11, 2014 \nWe decided to drive through Wickenburg for nostalgic reasons from our youth. We were going to drive all the way home but decided to just stay the night.\n\nWe drove up and asked for a room. The man at the counter... Bruce was sweet as apple pie! We got a room with a AAA discount for $80. The place was BIG! lots and lots of rooms! it was very old west. YES the place is OLD... BUT whoever owns the place LOVES it! our room was cozy and old but I loves the heavy cotton velvet drapes which were VERY CLEAN and the pink velvety chair then the over puffed beds were just ...... lets just say it was a very nice nights sleep!\n\nThey have flat screen tv..... my husband was watching football until midnight!\nthey do have wifi and the pool area looked nice.\nThey do have breakfast in the lobby. It is a little sparse but there is plenty to eat and the quality isn't bad for being on the road.\nthe place may be old but it is nicely taken care of! \n\nPat, the very nice lady who checked me out was very warm and pleasant too. Thank you!\n\nWill be staying there again as I will be traveling to Scottsdale on the weekends! Im actually looking forward to it!"
"2","Stayed again 10/17/2014\nExcellent check in by Bruce and our queen room was clean! I love this place! \nParking was a little rough later in the evening  and several work trucks made navigating the parking area difficult.  I would suggest to the management to have the larger vehicles park on the street. Checking out was quick and easy!"
"2","Yesterday had one of our desktops bootup to the \""Blue Screen of Death\"" so took the system over to Scott's shop. Scott understood how important this system was to our business and immediately went to work repairing the system. At 7:00 pm he called telling me that it was done."
"1","Apparently the new owner has trouble keeping employees.  The cook had not shown up in two days so the owner (who is not a cook) was cooking.  The server made it obvious to us that she did not like the owner or her ability to cook.   Service was not good, food was ...ok. Was charged extra for fries with sandwich instead of potato salad, but server never mentioned it was a dollar more.  That info was hidden in the tiny fine print on a different page of the menu from the sandwiches.  The bathroom was even dirty so I guess the dishwasher quit too. \n\nDisappointed in the total down grade of the place."
"2","Always good food whenever I go there people are friendly especially kera and chealsea"
"2","Wonderful food!  We ate Steak Kew, chicken fried rice, crab angels, BBQ Ribs, chicken lo me in and sweet and sour pork.  ALL the food was fresh, hot and tender.  Al food is also made with NO MSG.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the service was excellent (Mae).  The owners are very nice people.  Also, the food portions are huge!  Great job!!!!"
"1","Awful food!! Shells are not crispy, partially cooked, meat has NO NO NO flavor.  Their combinations stink - People don't just eat Enchilada's! Poor choice on the Taco salad. Rolled tacos are called Taquitos.  There is no juiciness with the Fajitas, the prices are out of sight. Re-fried Beans are usually mashed so there are bits of beans, but not whole uncooked beans...disgusting! Kid's menu goes to 10, what are 11, 12  year olds? Adults? \n\nYour menu needs an overhaul. The bathrooms are small and smell like mildew. Waitresses take forever to get you drink refills - unless its a bar item. The space in the building is so cramped you can't sit 4 comfortably at a table. \n\nThe old green color on the walls is so uninviting. Why not decorate like an authentic Mexican restaurant? Horse pictures - is old west, not Mexican. American / Mexican restaurant - maybe. \n\nAnita's Cocina is tired, needs a desperate update. Get with today's technology offer free wifi. Take your outside decorations inside, call restaurant impossible...you need help!"
"2","Love this place! Great burgers, and amazing shakes. We've been going here for years and years, it's a must stop if you are in or going through Wickenburg. try the pineapple shake and of course a cheeseburger!"
"1","Horrible... Other than the view, everything about this place was disappointing: service, menu, food, prices.  \n\nThe menu had absolutely no creativity or originality. All of the dishes were very basic / traditional, covered with various butter sauces, and served with the same boring sides: mashed potatoes or rice pilaf and vegetable of the day (green beans)\n\nThe quality of the food was even worse. My wife ordered the 'ruby red' ahi tuna... When it came out, it was completely gray throughout from oxidation and lacking any type of seasoning other than the char residue from a grill in need of cleaning. The petite (8oz) filet was no more than a half inch thick and wasn't a very good cut of meat. \n\nGiven the quality of the food, it was ridiculously overpriced. Most entree's were $32-$35, including the two mentioned above. The wine list also seemed very pricey. Most bottles were at least $10-$15 higher than at other restaurants we frequent or about 4x retail. \n\nDo yourself a favor and check out Ken's Creekside instead. We went there the night before Shugrue's and the difference was like night and day. Better food, ambiance, prices, and service. Even Outback looks like a five star restaurant compared to this place."
"1","A tour guide who has been living in Sedona for over 20 years highly recommended this restaurant to us. So we tried it. My husband was very excited when he heard they had the best steak and seafood.  The prices of the entrees were very high. Almost everything was in the $30 dollar range.  My husband ordered Seabass, my son ordered Gumbo, I ordered salmon and my daughter ordered a cheeseburger.  Honestly, nothing was that great. Just ok. Well, for the price charged, 'just ok\"" isn't good enough. Even the bloody mary wasn't good. Our bill was $122. plus not including tip. I would never return to this restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it to others.  Also, there isn't even a view. For these prices, I would expect at least a view. LOL"
"1","walked in the door @ 8:45 and was promptly told they were closed although there were people in the dining room. We went down to mooney's and ordered food there. surprisingly enough, the food came from Shugrues. hmmm..."
"1","Horrible !!!!  The teenagers who work here are more interested in socializing than serving customers.  I have been coming to this location for over a year because it is close to my house , but must say I will drive a little further now just so my order will be correct !  I dont understand ????? Are suburb teenagers IQ's going so far down that they cant get even master a cheeseburger fries and drink order?   I get excellent correct orders at Maryland pkwy and trop location on my way to work!!!!  I challenge the owner if this location to order  a meal here and I would be beyond shocked if it is hot and correct!  One example: i ordered a cone a diet coke and 2 coffee.  They give me 2 coffee.  I say \"" my cone?\""  He looks at the big bright screen with the order and  says \"" oh ya \"".  Gives me my cone.   Then a few seconds pass.  \"" my diet coke ?\""  Once again another long hard look at the screen followed by a puzzled look and another \"" uggggghh oh ya\"".  Need I say more.  Go somewhere else !!!!!"
"1","Hey, go there like 2am and you most likely see the guy outside with some girl,who was sitting on a stool. Went in to get a hotdog. Right, they were dark in color and all wrinkled . Nice deal 1/4 lb.hotdog and chips too bad it was more like 1/4 lbeef jerky and chips. I walked out with nothing and went over to Timbers. I won't take a chance going there to get something fresh."
"1","Greasy and quick should be the name of this place.. I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was drenched in oil.. it was disgusting."
"1","If you love cold \""glue\"" soup and terrible service...this is the place for you! Went there today for a quick lunch with my sister on my quest to try all things pumpkin and was really let down.\n\nNegatives\n1) Our waitress forgot we were there and then forgot our drinks, then after getting our drinks, never refilled them again.\n2) Soup was delivered cold. Yum, my favorite....Not! (Yeah, I went all 90's on it)\n3)Not a cheap place to eat - 2 bowls of soup and 1 piece of pie and I'm out $30!\n\nPositives\n1) The cornbread and honey butter was good\n2) The pumpkin pie was tasty and will probably make my pumpkin list, however next time I will just go buy a whole pie and take it home.\n\nSorry guys, its a no - go!"
"2","Food was good but the service was amazing!  Heidi was one of the nicest people... She is worth the to come back"
"1","Ordered the Thanksgiving take-out dinner. Very dissapointing. My husband liked the turkey so that's why I gave 2 stars. Everything tasted like it was frozen and the reheating instructions are to microwave pretty much everything. I realized getting a take-out dinner isn't going to be the freshest, but I've ordered from Whole Foods and Von's in the past and wasn't dissapointed. This meal however was terrible and very salty. It tasted like a Thanksgiving frozen dinner and I followed all the instructions carefully. We knew something was strange when we arrived and all the meals were being unloaded from big trucks in the parking lot. Won't be doing it again."
"2","I enjoy there corn bread honey butter and cheese soup.  They do a mean tuna melt and the blue berries and cheese pie is top notch. Sometimes it hit or miss but when its good it's good. .."
"2","I Love Love Love their Pizza! Friendly Service and I have Pizza from there at least 3 times a month! The online ordering and specials make it easy! Everything was fresh and made to perfection and the price is always right.. I'll be back! :)"
"1","lets see. i order a pizza online. after 45 min, the preparation meter was still showing being prepped. i called the store to check on my order and they gave my pizza to someone else with the same name. i quess the quality check process and the meter were not working that night. very sad. it was a good reminder as to why i don't order from Domino's anymore. live and learn i guess and i got a stiff reminder why i have stayed away. the pizza may be advertised as better but the service is still the same old poor. . i wont order from them again."
"2","I love this nail salon.  I came here originally for gel nails.  The second time I came in Debbie suggested using \""Hot gel\"" because my nails were in such bad shape.  I love the way my nails are done.  They look really nice and they last for a month (unless I use them as tools).  Debbie does a great job!"
"1","Went in for a haircut. Nice place. Multiple barber chairs. 1 barber. He seemed irritate that I showed up at 2pm on a Monday. Told me I MUST have an appointment to be seen, which wouldn't be for several hours.  I won't be visiting that place again."
"2","I really like this place.  They have great combination meals.  The fresh and crisp taste of the snap peas assures you that they just made your food when you ordered it.  I am one of those people who goes in to pick up my food and doesn't like to wait for delivery.  They are fast and efficient, even if you walk in and order!"
"1","Where have all the good Chinese restaurants gone? I recently moved to this side of town and decided that I would try it out. \n\nI got the vegetable lo mein, easy enough, nothing that should be messed up in a Chinese place. I called ahead and it was all ready when I came to pick it up 15 minutes later. The lady was nice but I guess decided to jack up the price $2 from the menu. I didn't say anything, but actions spoke louder than words and I left no tip. The restaurant is FILLED with cans of food all over, so obviously nothing is fresh. Gross. \n\nI decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so I went home with an open mind, hoping to find a treasure. Well all I found was junk. The noodles were slimy and had a weird thick gooey sauce (from a can) smothered all over it. My one piece of broccoli could hardly mark it as a vegetable dish, so they added a pound of cabbage. I don't mind cabbage but that is not what I ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies. \n\nI will never be going back. I will though continue my search for good food in Henderson! Wish me luck..."
"2","Just moved to this side of town and am always looking for good Chinese food. I drove past the sign and decided to check it out. I didn't know it was mostly a take out place but once I was there decided to give it a try anyhow. I was surprised to see how  reasonable to prices were - great lunch specials. I ordered the Mongolian beef for myself and the Teriyaki chicken bowl for my husband. The food took about 15 minutes so i was confidant everything was cooked to order. Everything was delicious!! I would have given it 5 stars but when i pulled up outside at 11:15am (supposed to open at 11am)  the doors to the place were still locked and lights off... I was about to pull away when the owners showed up and welcomed me in. I am glad  they caught me otherwise I would have missed out!!"
"1","Update as of 8/13-took my dogs for boarding for the day. Lady @ front (curly mullet/obese ) was very rude and unprofessional. And slow! Also- The girl that came out to take my dogs for boarding was so quiet & looked afraid of people & dogs, Not warm & reassuring the way someone That handles animals should appear. She Just came out & Stood in front of me , not uttering  a word. After a few seconds she reached her hand out for my\nleashes, so socially awkward. I felt like I was in a Woody Allen /Tim Burton movie. These people are creepy and not cool. I'm done w this place..\n\n\n\n\nClean and nice facility ,good for minor services for your furry babies ( nail trim, grooming etc). Overpriced for major services and I wasn't so impressed with the vet."
"1","We will never go here again. Every time we take our daughter here the next day she is sick. The last two times she has gotten viral infections and we have to go to the ER as she got a temp of 105. Obviously this place is not cleaning their facility properly!!!!!!"
"1","HORRIBLE SERVICE!\n\nThis store offered to ship my WINE and since it is delicate and we know how bad UPS drivers toss around boxes, I paid for the insurance. A bottle broke so my wine got sent back to me. When I went to pick it up, I found 10 of my 12 bottles sitting in the bottom of a box. I offered to re-wrap the bottles so they would arrive safely. The store manager denied the re-shipping of my package. She said, \""IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHIP WINE.\"" hmm what is wrong with this statement? Its called BAD BUSINESS.\n\nWhy did they ship it in the first place? Take my money and run huh. No reimbursement, no apology, I still have the wine and it needs to get to another location. I called corporate and was promised that my problem would be resolved within 48 hours of my complaint. It's a week later and no resolution, no phone call, and now the lady at corporate is ignoring my messages. Just give me my money back and I'll take my business elsewhere....FOREVER!\n\nThere are many many more details and problems with this story, but I was trying to keep it simple. DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS!!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE, FULL OF LIES, and THEY TREAT YOUR STUFF LIKE CRAP AND STEAL FROM YOU!!!!"
"2","my go to haircut place. nothing fancy, not expensive, and get $2 off every time I go there by checking in on my phone."
"2","We saw Jesse's when we went to the Soggy Dog to give our pup a bath.  We'd already had dinner plans that night but made a note to try it the first chance we got.  \n\nI called in to order and was put on hold for a minute.  I ordered a large pie and garlic knots and the girl told me it would be about 20 minutes.  My husband picked it up and it was ready just under that.  \n\nThe prices: amazing!  It's so hard to find a good deal these days but Jesse's offers their 16\"" pie for $6.99 every day!  \n\nThe pizza: Sauce-to-cheese ratio was great.  The crust was very thin, but did not \""sag\"" when folded.  Their homemade sauce was slightly sweet and pretty good.  For the price, this pie holds up well against some of its more expensive competitors.  \n\nThe garlic knots: small (I love small garlic knots!), although soft with no crunch.  A little too buttery.  But matched with Jesse's homemade sauce, they're actually pretty good.  \n\nThe shop: small place, no tables, pretty much all take-out (I think they do deliver locally for a fee).  \n\nIf this is your local pizza place, go ahead and order from here on pizza night.  It'll be money well-spent :)"
"2","I love Jesse's pizza and am much happier giving them my business over Metro. My husband and I love the fact that they're a small, local place that turns out a great product. There's always something awesome about having a staff greet you by name with a smile. Not to mention, their prices can't be beat. You can't even get a frozen pizza at the grocery store as inexpensive as their large plain cheese."
"1","So, I place an order at 4:04 and am told that it should be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I show up at 4:33 only to find out that my food was given to someone else.  Not sure  how I feel about this.\nWe love the pizza and knots -- but the service level of giving your food to someone else and then telling you it will be another 15 minutes is a hearty load of crap."
"1","Where do I start ? What a disappointment . Not worth the drive or the money. There are no carts avail till your tee time so no putting prior to your round . The starter is an IDIOT ! We told him our name 3 times & he said oh follow that group .. Ok then 5 mins later he said oh you are playing with that group that already tee off meet them on next hole ?? Really ?? So we missed the first hole. Pace was not great waiting on holes & hello !! Women play this game too ! I only saw one woman my wife ! Way over cooked got hot dogs .. We will not return !"

"1","In November of 2012 I had a pea sized spot on my underarm that didn't look right, so my PCP referred me to Woodson Dermotology.  \n\nI saw the PA, John.  I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.  I was surprised, as I had ringworm a number of years ago.  But I trusted him and took the pills and cream I was prescribed.  I had a follow-up appoint the next month, and explained to him that it's only getting bigger (MUCH bigger) and didn't look or feel like ringworm.  It was not itchy, did not spread, not scaly, and didn't seem to be contagious.  He reassured me that it \""just presents differently in the armpit\"" I was frustrated but took the new pills and creams I was given.  Again, nothing happened except it was getting BIGGER.  I again had a follow up the next month and expressed my concerns AGAIN.  Nothing, just more creams and pills. This went on and on every month until JULY!!!  For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.  Upon googling it, I read that even UNTREATED ringworm lasts a maximum of 4 months.  \n\nI would much rather hear \""I'm not really sure what this is! Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion\""  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.  But he is too proud to do that.  \n\n In July I went in and there was a PA fresh out of school that John was training.  This PA took ONE look at my \""ringworm\"" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, \""I think you have given me this before\"" he said \""hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before\""  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, \""just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!\""  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. \n\n At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said \""what is that?\""  she said \""polysporin\""  I quickly yell \""I'm allergic to that!\"" before she can get any on me.  Why do you even ask what I am allergic to?  Seriously!  I was supposed to come back 2 weeks later to get the results and get my stitches out. \n\n So 2 weeks later I come back to get my Biopsy results and stitches removed. She took out my stitches and started to leave.  I said \""Excuse me, do you have my biopsy results?\"" she said \""No\"" and started to walk again.  I said \""Are you sure, it's been 2 weeks\"" She sighed and actually opened my file this time (imagine that!) and said \""oh yeah, here it is, it's benign\""  I said \""ok, but is it the granuloma annulare?\"" she said \""yes, that was positive\""  I said \""ok, can you tell me what that is or anything about it?\""  She said she wasn't familiar with it.  OK...... \""can I talk to John or anyone else that does know?\""  She said \""no, they're all busy, but you can make another appointment in a few weeks to talk to him if you have questions\"" I was done, didn't give an answer just stormed out, said goodbye and thank you to the only person worth a crap there (the front office) and went home. \n\n Why would you have someone give you biopsy results and not tell you anything about it?!?  I have wasted almost a YEAR of my life and missing work to go to these appointments every month, because John was too proud to admit he was wrong.  I would love to thank the new guy that diagnosed me at first sight, but never saw him again.  Please don't waste your time here!  If you get a super early appointment there is no wait, John is VERY nice, however none of that matters if you can't get treated for what it actually wrong."
"1","My friend and I used to come here after class to grab a quick lunch to eat. Anyways the lunch menu is around $8-12 depending what choices you get.  The portions were good enough but it was short of amazing.  Personally, I liked the pasta it was descent.  I wouldnt mind going back here again, I thought. \n\nWe came back again to RMG again during lunch and came back to a horrible experience.  We were seated near the bar area and it took like 15minutes for someone to finally realize we were there and when the server took our orders. It was about 25-30minutes till we got our food and it was cold when it arrived.  We ended up not finishing the food and waited for the server to come back.\n\nHe asked how everything was and we let him know that the food was cold and the service was not great.  He comped our meal and we left.  From then, I knew I wouldnt come back here again.  \n\nHowever, about a week ago I went back to have lunch there again since it has been almost a year since I havent gone back to RMG and it finally concluded the fact why I wouldnt want to come back here again. \n\nThe complimentary bread was hard and not tasteful.  We ordered the $2 entrees for $25 ( two appetizers and two entrees) we ordered the mac & cheese bites some other appetizer. Both appetizers tasted bland and it seemed like it was just microwaved.  The entrees were average, its only good if youre hungry but other than that, go somewhere else to fill your appetite for italian food."
"1","There was nothing wrong with the service. The food was just not great. We ordered 2 appetisers and 3 entrees. The appetisers were good. They were creative and flavorful. The entrees left a lot to be desired. Just didn't make the grade. The portions were enourmous...Food marginal at best. Will not be back. Would much rather go to Carraba's."
"2","No complaints. Greg was our server. He was very professional, upbeat, and very attentive. The customer service ment a lot to me. I will continue to come back and enjoy this wonderful restaurant. Food was delicious,  prices were great."
"1","I used to enjoy the store because they had the best newsstand in the area. I don't know what happened but that is no longer the case. There are a lot of empty spaces and the magazines that are there are out of order. The newsstand is practically unshoppable. It's sad when I can go across the street to Target and get a better selection and more up to date selection of magazines. \n\nIn addition to the poor state of the newsstand they no longer carry music and DVDs. It is also difficult to locate new book releases. You are better off going around the corner to Barnes & Noble."
"1","Feeble attempt at service.  C'mon if I order a Turkey Bacon avocado sandwich, then put Bacon on it.  Unfortunately the server didn't check back with us until after we had finished.  Didn't offer to fix anything.  YOU OWE ME SOME BACON that I paid for.  Thank god for surveys and yelp to vent."
"2","As a single lady & a student I can buy everything I need here! Fresh produce is great & there freezer meals are delicious on nights cooking for one is too much.  Personal Favorite Products include: red curry simmer sauce, mahi mahi burgers, mediterranean feta and garlic chipotle salsa!"
"1","I've been to this car wash 4 times. I pass other car washes just to come here. On this visit they have broken my ignition key and now I cannot start my car. The idiot that did it just handed my keys back to me like nothing was wrong. I'm pissed and stranded. I will never come back here again! And what is they're compensation: cards for 2 free car washes. Really!"
"2","Decided to finally was my messy vehicle to I brought it in. I thought the price was a bit high forthe gold service and a hand wax. It around $50. They did do a great job! The back seats came out great, keep in mind I have 2 Rottweilers that are in my car almost daily. I would come back here when needed."
"2","What can I say?  I love their products.  My favorite is the Hemp lotion for very dry hands.  I went into buy it and the nice saleswoman showed me that it was cheaper to buy the gift box because it was on sale.  She was right.  I brought two."
"1","Well I have stayed at every Marriott hotel in Vegas at one time or another.. Or so I thought   Stayed for a day trip and found the only hotel that was time warped back to 1995.  Fairly clean and staff is professional but hotel is very very out of date and needs paint and carpet etc...  Come on Marriott update this dog or put her down!"
"1","2 of 3 items were not cooked properly. \nI used to eat here all the time, different owners i THINK.\nPastrami sandwich smelled rotten. I took 1 bite and just could not eat it (and I love pastrami). I did not want to complain as it was a business luncheon. The waitress did not ask to correct it, did not offer it to be removed from bill, she sent \""manager\"" over who \""could not smell\"" so he took it back to the cook. The manager came back and said it was fine. No offer to remove from bill, not I am sorry, no NOTHING!!!!!\nMy favorite  app from there is calamari.  My app was not cooked properly, it was really batter tasting and super rubbery.  \nI cannot tell you how many times over the years I have had this at this restaurant- and loved it every time.\nI can only say I will never go back there and never have any business luncheons there, nor will I recommend to anyone I work with at the automall.\nI did get a touch of food poisoning from my 1 bite of sandwich, I did pay the 10..00 for that food poisoning, and that will never happen again.\nNOT GOOD AT ALL!!!!!!"
"2","Yes, you see it correctly, I just gave Chevy's 5 stars.... Why you ask? Well when i lived in Cali we would meet our friends at Chevy's for the awesome happy hour and have some great margaritas. Since coming to Vegas I thought that there was not any Chevys around anywhere. \nWe ventured over to the mall and guess what I spy?!?!?! CHEVY'S. \n\nI think they have great salsa and I really like the nachos.. I am in no way saying that this is \""real\"" Mexican food but it was good and cheap. If I really think about it I am giving this place stars just like how you would give your friends that you have not seen in a long time a high five long before you ask how life has been treating them. So in all reality the food could have been so-so but it was all about the reminiscing.\n\nAnyone want to go get a Margarita... Count me in!"
"2","Been back a couple times since last review.  Margaritas were perfect both times.  Watermelon margaritas are unstoppable!  Chile relleno was a little bland and soupy, but the rest of the menu was terrific as usual."
"1","Well, we were trying to find \""cheese dip\"" in Vegas.  Some kind of Tex-Mex.  We found it.  Let me tell you, that was the best thing about this place.  The cheese dip was actually pretty good and a very ample serving.  Chips were thin, crispy and not too salty.  We really liked it until the entrees came.  Ugh!!  Pork tamales tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in them.  Pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat.  The cheese enchiladas were, um, cheesy.  That's about it.  Not much taste at all.  Refried beans were smoky and not horrible.  But the rice, was the worst Mexican/Spanish rice I have ever put in my mouth.  Terrible!!  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because our server, Boone, was awesome.  It's not his fault the food stank.  I would not go there again, unless I was just wanting cheese dip and no entrees.  If you're looking for Mexican OR Tex-Mex, you can do a LOT better."
"1","Food was cold service sucked"
"1","Ate lunch there yesterday.  Prices are out of sight for this ole Texas boy.  Back home lunch usually costs us about $15 and we can hardly walk from being so full.  Here the bill was $27 and only one of us had a coke with lunch.   Meat was tough and had no favor what so ever.  Wife's platter was a little better but not up to Texas standards.\nIf you're going to call yourself a \""Tex-Mex\"" resturant you ought to know about real Tex-Mex food.  Service wasn't up to standard either.  Had to ask for more chips and salsa and didn't get a two coke until he delivered the bill.  He had walked past our table more than twice while my glass was empty.  I will stay home next time I'm in the mood for Tex-Mex and make it myself."
"1","Perhaps the new Mexican restaurant we have been going to in the SW (I reviewed them twice if you are wondering who I am talking about) has totally ruined me for other Mexican restaurants, but this place was really underwhelming. \n\nI was craving a quesadilla, and we were at the mall, so it seemed simple enough, head on over to Chevys. I have been here a handful of times, and remember it being fine, so I thought why not? \n\nTo start the chips and salsa were pretty good. Only complaint there is that they don't give you very many at a time, and then you have to wait for them to come and refill multiple times (if you are munching a lot, like we were) so it is slightly irritating but not that big of a deal.\n\nHubby and I decided to both get quesadillas, me - Cheese, his - Steak. We didn't really pay much attention to the menu (I regretted that later) and just ordered. When they arrived, I was pretty disappointed as they were very small, and plated next to sad brown looking guacamole and sour creme sitting on wilted lettuce....not a great presentation for sure. However the most disappointing was the taste, it was just not yummy. I can't even put my finger on why really...the cheese?? the weird peppers?? I'm not really sure, but I have had quesadillas at a million Mexican restaurants and these were terrible when compared to those. They were very much like the pre-made quesadillas you see sitting out a buffet...just ick. I could only make it through half, hubby ate all his, but definitely didn't enjoy it.\n\nThe worst part was when we got the bill, my quesadilla was over $10 and his was $12....ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? I know it was our fault for not paying attention to the prices on the menu, but ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? Those are the lunch prices for those teeny, tiny things?!?! They were both made on the smaller soft taco size tortillas, folded over, so smaller than any quesadilla I have ever had at any other restaurant and $2-$4 MORE. SERIOUSLY disappointing. When the waiter came and took my plate, he asked if I wanted a box for the rest, I said no, and he didn't seem to notice or care to ask why I only ate such a small portion of the smallest quesadillas ever. \n\nAnyway, not planning on ever going back. I am still irritated about the whole experience several hours later. Food was 1 star for sure, extra star for decent service."
"2","This review is based on Wildhorse's wedding facilities only.  I've never played golf a day in my life.\n\nI got married at Wildhorse last year, after a friend who also got married there recommended it to me, and there are no words to explain how amazing and happy my experience was with Wildhorse.  We looked at about a dozen venues in both Southern Ca and Las Vegas/Henderson and the moment I walked into Wildhorse, I knew it was the one.  My happiness only grew after we met Elena H. (the food & beverage manager).  She is amazing, helpful, and friendly.  She was the biggest help in planning my wedding.  Our wedding day went off without a hitch and I have absolutely no complaints about anything.  The food was delicious, the venue is elegant, the greens are beautiful, the staff is friendly, everything is perfect about this place, including the cost.  It was very budget-friendly for us.  I definitely think that we got the best bang for the buck.  I really cannot put into words how incredibly happy I was with my experience at Wildhorse.  I wish I could give them 10 stars."
"1","Would give this a zero star rating if possible. \n\nCame in here for new breaks last year because it was close to our house. Once they said they were done with the breaks I took off to a job I had that day. Horrible screeching noise which made me go back there for them to fix it. \n\nAgain still noise and after only half a year I know I needed new breaks again! Went to econolube down the road today and even they found some un secure bolt that PurrfectAuto had placed in there and was carving the rotors."
"1","We dined in for lunch one day, the floor had been mopped with a dirty/sour mophead, you can smell the funky odor on the floor. Teri beef is fatty/greasy and tough. Mahi Mahi is just chunks of cooked fish. Huge slathering of stucky white rice and overly mayoed mac salad with no flavor. My chicken katsu came with what I still think is ketchup and no katsu sauce. I asked for katsu sauce and the boss lady says that is katsu. No it's Ketchup, not tonkatsu sauce like everyone knows. So I asked for a side of teri sauce instead. My chicken katsu is Deeeep fried extra hard and the chicken had tough skin underneath. Too crunchy and taste like low grade chicken, greasy. Overly mayoed mac salad and a huge wave of white rice that wasn't all that fresh. Is this good food? I guess some think so and they are welcome to it. I like a certain place on 215 and Green Valley or 215 and Eastern much better."
"2","Very delicious. Reasonable prices. My husband and l stopped by randomly and will come back again. He ordered the teriyaki combo plate and I have the spicy chicken combo bowl. Very delicious and nice customer service! You should check it out!"
"2","The saimin is amazing!!! Foods good here a must try the only thing I don't like is their Mac salad and their burgers are pretty dry they may be frozen patties.  If you're ordering take out call ahead otherwise it will be a wait they seem to serve the in house patrons before the take out not in sequence by when they receive the order"
"1","For many years Dillard's was my favorite store. However I have noticed a decided lack of initiative these last few months. Dresses that were identical except for the color were priced differently. Trying to return a dress ( for the first time ever) when I saw it had gone on sale during the last 10 days I was told they didn't have time to change the tag right now and it would have to be put in the back. I was also told Dillard's won't honor the current sales price because they \""don't play games.\""There were 3 saleswomen and me in the whole department yet not one of them could mark the dress down?! If they don't play games why not price the identical dresses with identical price tags to start with? Another clerk in a different department explained they keep the item in the back for 72 hours before putting it out again. Presumably this is meant to discourage smart shoppers. Since then I have sent two emails and not recieved a reply. There are too many stores where pricing is lower, policies more friendly and staff less haughty for these kinds of tactics. I will be speaking with my wallet and taking my business elsewhere"
"1","Wings were good nice and spicy but a little overcooked and they only gave us 6 napkins for a table of 6 people not enough if u eating wings.  Ordered couple beers and they were not that cold. Waitresses had nice attitudes though"
"2","I have no complaints. Great location. Great service. Had the flat iron with asparagus, bacon and pearl onions for $17. Delish! I recommend the loaded mash potatoes. Not really a potato fan but these were so good!"
"1","I absolutely *used* to love this place. It had such a large and eclectic selection for super low prices compared to every other thrift store around, but since their renovation several months ago, prices have been seriously jacked up ($1 T-Shirts are now priced at $4.99! $7 Golden Girls throwbacks are now $14! ~ Blanche? Something is amiss...~) and all the merchandise looks like bland, generic stuff you can get at the dollar store or a yard sale for cheaper. This place used to be my thrift store go-to, but at these prices and the change in the type of merch they place on the floor, it's only \""meh\"" now.  I guess I'll have to get my second hand fix at the Goodwill on Eastern - and deal with that parking nightmare... Gah!"
"1","NEVER EVER buy a gift for someone here.  They claim a hassle free return but if you dont have the original card the gift was purchased on, they will NOT allow you to return the item.  They will hassle you to death trying to keep the money hostage.  The receipt says \""no hassle return and you only need the proof of purchase and original packaging\"" but when you go to return an item, they will NOT allow you to get your cash back."
"1","This place is a joke.Looked fwd to visiting after seeing their ads & website announce how homemade & from scracth the food was. Our waitress,while nice enough, took a long time to get us drinks. We asked for `real` milk not creamers for our coffee and she looked as us like we were from outer space.She finally brought a 1/4 cup (like adrinking glass cup) of milk which was hard to pur into coffee without spilling. It was Sunday and it was `busy` but they seemed to have enough staff on hand to not warrant a 40 minute wait for crappy food. Just as I was about to get up my food came. Wife had eggs & bacon and I had chicken breats w/country gravy & 3 eggs on `special`. How long should this take to scoop awful sloppy gravy onto a bolw with a fried breast and some eggs?. Awful from top to bottom NOT WORTH the trip from the strip (or anywhere).Plus it was EXPENSIVE- like Bellagio expensive,if I want these prices I`ll stay on strip. Lastly, the checkout sells Christian books, not somethng I appreciate when people mix their religion into business"
"2","Clean, nice staff."
"1","II went here looking for a primary care doctor. I made an appointment on Monday for the following Thursday the problem I was having had gotten worse so I had gone to UMC Quick care on Tuesday. They treated me and instructed me to keep my appointment and follow up with them. The UMC doctor told me that they would most likely want to do some more testing. I was early for my appointment, to get the paperwork done, but still waited for an hour after the time of my appointment. When I was finally called back the nurse took my vitals and I waited even longer for the doctor in the little room. The Doctor never came, instead a PA came in and said what UMC did was fine, she never even examined me. At that point I was just glad to be out. The only reason I would recommend them is if you wanted to make money in a law suit you would probably win after having them treat you."
"2","The food is great. It is almost always crowded though, probably cause the food is great. The servings are huge. You can get in and out fast. Parking can be a bit of an issue though because it is always busy in there."
"2","Normally I'm a huge fan of Chipotle but this time wasn't the best. My food was cold and they gave my friend the wrong salsa. C'mon Chipotle get your shit together! I'm giving you a 4 for now because of all the other times I've been extremely satisfied here but I will drop you down some stars if this shit happens again!"
"1","I emailed Chipotle Corporate HQ in Denver as once again this location fubared my order. I got rushed through the line and didn't get my entire order the first time so I went back again. The 2nd time I asked for a kids quesadilla meal for my 2 year old. After repeating it 2x quite clearly they make a regular sized quesadilla, then when I ask about the sides for the kids meal they're like did you ask us for a kids meal? And this was from the same clueless woman who just repeated my order TWICE and acknowledged she was making a kids cheese quesadilla! And to polish it all off the manager's shoulder shrug and I don't give a damn attitude pushed me to the point I fired up my verbal cannons and unloaded. I told her I am done with having my food screwed up every time I walk into this location. DONE! I promised her I would be contacting Chipotle corporate, and I have kept my word. This Yelp review is just sending another virtual cannonball downrange to follow the fusillade of protests I've already fired off. \n\nLet's hope Chipotle Corporate HQ can inform the Henderson location that the priority is the customers and not cranking people through there like it's a dang cattle call. I'll gladly pay for your food, listen to me so you can sell me the stuff I want and make $30 instead of $22! Unless you're not in the business of making a profit, I would think this should be pretty important. \n\n1 pathetic star for 1 pathetic Chipotle outpost that has to be the worst location I've stepped foot into in 5 states. It's the best I can give and barely what they deserve."
"2","The owner is a GENEROUS man and super friendly!  He aims to please.  :)\nSo, he invited me back to try his food again and so glad I did.  \n\nThe chicken was still STELLAR of course.\n\nBut this time the pita bread was soft and fresh and fluffy.\n\nI didn't have a salad because there was a salad on my chicken and the greens and tomatoes were fresh and thinly sliced just the way I like them.\n\nThe rice was light and flavorful.\n\nThe tzatziki sauce was really good too.... thick like a dip with garlic, cucumber and herbs.  I could have just eaten this and the pita and been a happy camper.\n\nThe chicken gyro plate also came with a light red sauce on the side.  I wasn't sure what it was but upon tasting it, I poured it all over my chicken and rice like a gravy.  That sauce was really good.  I mean the chicken and rice were moist and flavorful already but this sauce just added a little extra dimension.\n\nOH!  And the Baklava.... definitely treat yourself to this sweet sensation.  It is sweet but not sugary sweet.  The phyllo dough is light and the nuts are finely chopped and it all just melts in your mouth.  After 1 bite, I knew I wasn't taking any of it home.\n\nThanks, Sophocles!  I'll be back again.  :)"
"2","I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant.  I was at the mall for a few hours tonight and decided to stop by Kylos Greek Cafe again.  I've been here several times in the past when I've had a groupon and totally loved it then.  I got the gyros combo with fries and a drink.  I got the supreme which was about 13 buck and it came with feta cheese and lettuce.  \n\nThe portion size is pretty large for the price and it definitely filled my stomach.  It is kinda messy if you try to eat it with your hands like you would a normal gyro.  I end up just eating it with my gold plated tiffany fork that I bring with me when I plan on eating out.  So I adverted the mess on my hands.  For mall food it's not bad compared to the other restaurants that barely survive"
"1","It really hurts me to update and down grade my review, but today, was so unacceptable.\n\nI walked into BRUS today, because my husband and I have decided that it is time for our 8 month old to sleep in her own room, (her crib). I got the \""breathable\"" mesh bumpers at my baby shower, almost a year ago, and they haven't really worked out for two reasons.\n\n1- My crib has a solid wood panel in the back, and 2- my daughter rams her head into her crib... like she's a little bull.. she likes to sleep in corners.\n\nSo, because she is older, and the SIDS risk isn't really a factor anymore, i wanted to look around to find some normal (padded) bumpers.\n\ni believe the associate's name was Beth, and man, she was as mean as a snake.\n\nShe pretty much told me that  I would be putting my baby in danger if I put bumpers on her crib............. She \""predicts\"" that some states won't even sell bumpers in the future. I should contact my doctor before I buy bumpers.... Because babies can get tangled up in the bumpers.....\n\nNot really seeing how this is possible, when bumpers get tied to the crib?\n\nThen, the funny part of it is, that she has a bumper that she can sell me for $20.\n\n\nSeriously? What happened to the dangers?"
"2","My wife and I went to Chianti for our anniversary.  And, we had a 20% off coupon.  We started with the garlic bread and as an appy ordered the cheesy artichoke dip (Carciofi Gratinati).  Both were wonderful, as were the drinks on the specials menu.  For our entrees, we ordered the Margherita pizza and the eggplant parm (Melanzane Alla Parmigiana).  The pizza was.....OK, nothing to write home about, but the eggplant parm was absolutely perfect, with the accompanying pasta served perfectly al dente.  We mentioned to the excellently attentive waiter that it was our anniversary, and he brought out a huge slice of tiramisu for our dessert, without our asking for it, and without charging us for it!  And when he brought out the check, we noticed he'd taken the 20% off the entire meal, including alcohol.  Doesn't get any better than that.  Now if they could only make the pizza a little more enticing, they'd earn five stars."
"1","Last time we went to this KFC they forgot the sides.  They did it to us again on Sep 3rd. No fries, and no biscuits.  We have had issues with this particular KFC location before so from now on I think we will stick to El Pollo Loco if we want chicken.  EPL tends to get the order correct.\n\nOne other thing: the chicken is extremely salty, like dead sea salty.  Is that a KFC trend or just this location?  I am guessing KFC in general."
"1","I'd give this place Zero Stars if I could. Where to begin?..\n\nThe entire place is dirty. Seriously, noone is even cleaning up the hair off the floor or bothering to wipe off counters. The bathrooms are even gross.\n\nThe staff is lazy and more importatnly, the students have NO clue what they're doing.  Most of them have no business being out on the floor yet.\n\nExamples - I went here for a simple mani/pedi. 3 HOURS into my appointment, I finally gave up and told a manager I was leaving. There were too many disgusting reasons to list them all, but a few that stand out - The student doing my nails had never done a gel mani before and had no idea what she was doing. She literally spilled polish remover down my ENTIRE leg and then proceeded to soak my feet - which you CANNOT do if you're using gel polish. I had asked her several times if she was sure she knew what she doing, and she told me she'd gone in the back and asked the senior techs.\nShe had dandruff and was missing front teeth - no, it's not a beauty contest. But when the person giving you a manicure is literally shaking dandruff onto your hands, it's repulsive. Like it or not, if you're going to work in the beauty industry, you do have to take care of how you present yourself.\n\nI could go on and on...but I think you get the point."
"1","After the 1000th time of dealing with stupid situations in this store, I have decided to NEVER visit this one again. Too bad because it's fairly close to me, but I just have gotten to the point that I dread coming in here. One the surface you would think it's a great store, but on closer inspection I don't need the hassle.\n\nSo the final straw, I go in today to buy 4 things. One of which is peanut butter and I like to buy the fresh made stuff from the machine. I go over hit the button but nothing happens. I even sit there for a bit and mess with it trying to figure out what is wrong. Now since there are peanuts, I figure I just need to find someone to un-jam it. I go over to one guy who is in the Deli and tell him my problem. I even said that I knew it might not be his department but could he find someone. He says sure. 5 or 6 minutes later, I realize that NO ONE was coming. I walk over to two guys stocking fruits. I explain the problem when one guy goes, \""Oh so-and-so isn't here today so we can't fix it.\"" No even ATTEMPT at doing a damn thing or pretending to be concerned. I respond, \""It's probably just jammed. You probably just need a spatula or something like that. \"" I get another excuse that they never go over there and know nothing about those machines. Then one of the guys pulls a knife out and is like, \""OH I have this. Would this work.\"" At this point the other guy is still just standing there staring at me like he could careless and the one guy with the knife sounds about as useful as my shoe. I had a few words about this not being brain surgery and stormed off. \n\nI go and checkout. I ask the girl if there is a manager around. She says yes but he's on a register checking people out and won't be getting off. I'm so irritated that the manager isn't available to MANAGE his store. I just shake my head and walk away. \n\nThis is on top of me CONSTANTLY having to practically fight stupid every time I bother to use a check out person and not do it myself. I use reusable bags. I bring LOTS in with me but at some point they ALWAYS try to put something in a bag. When I ask them to take it out they act all insulted and give me some stupid excuse for why it NEEDS to be in a plastic bag. Yes because those f'n plastic bags are flippin made of chlorox and will really help stop any germs or they are made of 6000 lbs of cotton and will keep things from breaking. No, they are cheap , teeny tiny plastic bags and do nothing but cause more trash. And seriously, WTF does this happen EVERY SINGLE TIME. I even had one kid ask me if I wanted to bag my own groceries. I had a few words with him that he didn't like. \n\nOn top of things being broken and the staff being about as useful and intelligent as a rock, they also tend to be out of stuff. I haven't seen proscuitto in forever and they only carry one kind of smoked salmon. I found my trip to the Smith's over by the District yesterday to be MUCH more enjoyable and will probably start going there from now on out.\n\nI have shopped almost exclusively at Kroger brand stores my entire life. I've never had the kind of frustrations and headaches that I have at this store. Besides, it isn't in a great part of town so I'll be happy to stay off that side from now on out."
"1","Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses."
"2","It basically has everything I need when I need to buy any sport activity that I plan to take on! Bought my first bike here, scuba diving gear, my leg warmers, & a few purses & gym clothes.  Everyone in the store is so helpful and accommodating.  They are always willing to help and answer any questions I have and they are very knowledgeable with their equipment & their section.\n\nI'm even thinking to get scuba certified here in Sports Chalet, maybe one of these days I will :)"
"1","Three weeks ago we stopped in here looking for discs for disc golf. \n\nWhen we walked in, we asked an associate where the disc golf section was.\nHe looked as us blankly and said \""we don't have that stuff here.\""\n\nNot believing him, we walked around and, big surprise, we found a decent selection of discs. \n\nWe took a couple over to the guy and said \""you do have \""that stuff.\"" Next time just say \""I don't know.\""\""\n\nSo yesterday, I wanted to go get a new disc, and they had the one I wanted the last time we were there, I just didn't have the cash.\n\nSo we go in, and their selection is AWFUL.  They literally had 10 of one kind of disc, and 5 of another, (both drivers, which is what I was looking for, but they didn't have the one I wanted) and a handful of putters.\n\nSo I found a driver that was similar to the one I was thinking of getting, but wanted to see if they had anything in the back.  Having worked retail for years, I know most stores keep a little bit of back stock.\n\nSo...we approach an employee, who turned out to be the same guy who we had encountered last time.  We showed him the discs and asked if he had any back stock.  He barely glanced at the discs and said \""Not for that stuff.\""\n\nI'm sorry, what?  You don't even know what I have in my hands.  Don't talk down to a customer like that.\nWe found someone else to ask, and basically got the same thing.  It came off as an \""I don't know, so I'm just going to say no because I'm too lazy to go and look.\""\n\nRan into a manager as we were leaving, and asked her, and she actually explained that WHY they don't have anything in back stock, and she was the first person to apologize to us.  \n\nWhile they usually have a better selection, I may not go back again simply because of the service, or lack there of."
"1","Worst place with rude stylist!\nThey don't cut good and charge twice as much as other places. this is my worst experience ever! now i have no choice but to get stuck with this bad hair ...\n\nI went there it looks clean and there were magazines for you to look at and choose hair styles from. I did not wait that long and the receptionist was very nice and friendly(but later on realized she was not a receptionist, but a stylist, they don't have  receptionist). I am a very bubbly person and i am always smiling but this place just turned me into a whole new person. when the stylist asked me what i want i just told her i want to get rid of my split ends and a little shorter because i am bored with my long hair, but just keep the layersand trim the bangs (side bangs). she totally cut the hair straight, like when you look at the back on my shoulders it's a straight line not a V shape which means she got rid of my layers. and she also cut my bangs straight across my forehead, she cut it too short that it bounce up like a spring and i cannot put it on the side. I asked her to cut 2inches more because i told her i wanted it shorter and she was very rude and told me \""are you sure just 2inches, coz i can;t keep on cutting little by little\"" she was very loud and rude that all the other customers are looking at me and she is making it sound that i am being picky when i was all smiling and low voice when i am speaking to her. so i just told her to leave it it's fine and she still kept on saying \""are you? sure are you sure?\"". omg she wont stop and i feel so embarassed already. she said i was done and i wnet to pay and she said i owe $37 ... i saw on their wall it says adult cut and shampoo is $13.99 and i got a coupon that says i can get a haircut and shampoo for $10.99 ... she told me that she styled my hair so it's adult cut, style and shampoo which is $21.99  plus to blow dry my hair is additional $15 .... OMG what a rip off $15 to blow dry your hair??? are they not supposed to dry it anyway to check if their cut is accurate and no imperfections??? and what style??? she charged me more coz she  styled my hair, when in fact she just cut my hair straight and got rid of my old style which is the layers ... there were people waiting to pay and it was so embarassing i just paid the utrageous amount and left.  I am not really a picky person and I don't really ike to complain ... that is why i just paid and left ... but my hubby said i am always too nice that is why people take advantage of me ... so hopefully this review will be a warning to other people ... if you know your hairstylist and she is awesome for you then keep her, but if you go to fantastic sams don't go to that lady with light brown hair in a ponytail that looks mean because she is really rude."
"1","This store really lacks selection.  We went to the suit department, the selection was really no larger than a closet, when I asked for my size, they didn't even have it or I actually looked for it, there was no salesman around in the department.  When asked about another department in another part of the store, a salesperson gave us the wrong directions."
"1","If you're a marathoner or if it's your first marathon, you know by now that it's marathon tradition to eat a pasta dinner before the big race.\n\nI wanted to find a decent Italian restaurant on the strip or hit a buffet, but my friend was hell bent on finding an Old Spaghetti Factory somewhere in Nevada.  Whip out the trusty iPhone and there's supposedly a restaurant 8 miles away in Henderson and she's willing to drive us there. We go to the supposed location and it doesn't exist, go to a nearby mall and discover there's no such thing as an Old Spaghetti Factory in Nevada so what do we do?  And what's the next best option?  Olive Garden.\n\nIt's convenient.  It's close and it'll be too late to get dinner and go to bed at a reasonable hour if we try to eat on the strip.  I shudder at the thought of it but agree.  I'm staying a few extra nights so I can make up for it later.  \n\nThe redeeming qualities about this experience are the quick and friendly staff, virtually no wait time since we're out in the middle of nowhere, and a complementary tasting of the Moscato Castello del Poggio.  This was a light effervescent white wine with hints of peach.  Very refreshing and sweet and possibly a new favorite.  \n\nOur meals were average and sub par.  My bellini peach iced tea was too sweet and the mushroom ravioli was dry and overcooked and hard to chew.  The bread and pasta weren't bad but I still would have preferred to go elsewhere.  Olive Garden is a little too pricey for the food they serve and next year, we'll be finding something on the strip."
"1","I went here last week with the bf for lunch Ive been wanting to come here and try there food because I hadn't eaten here since I was a kid.\n\nThank god Ive stayed away from this place for so long! what a disappointment.\n\nSo we did the 2 for $25 deal...\n\nIt comes with all you can eat soup or salad, bread sticks, and pasta of your choice.\n\nWe had salad, bread sticks , and the fettuccine Alfredo as the main dish. \n\nThe salad was ok but i guess it would be kinda hard to mess up a simple salad, the bread sticks were hard and tasteless. As for the fettuccine it was ok nothing I would brag home to mama about Ive had way better it reminded me of something I could microwave from the grocery store no flavor at all I had to put a pound of salt and pepper on it just to make it ok to eat. \n\nI will not be returning to Olive Garden this is Las Vegas there are way to many good restaurants to eat at rather then waste my time at this fake \""Italian restaurant\"" not to mention the service was lousy.\n\nPlease avoid this microwave Italian food!"
"2","We've been here plenty of times before and it seems like its always crowded no matter what time or day.  The food is good and what I especially like is the unlimited soup or salad. In addition, the breadsticks are great and my 4 year old daughter can attest to this. \n\nThe entrees here are very good and I know I'm going to get shunned for saying this but I'm not a big cheese eater. I come here due to my wife loving Italian food. Nevertheless I still love it here due to the breadsticks, spaghetti and soup.\n\nI hope this review helps and Happy Eating!"
"2","Yummy food and good service... sat in the bar area and got thebar tender as a server and he,was nice   his name was beto ..great job... good food"
"1","Three reasons why I go to Ulta:\n1. They always send coupons every week\n2.I only buy Biolage, Redken or Paul Mitchell when they have the promo (buy 2 get 1 free)\n3.Close to my apt.\n\nPeople that work here aren't really helpful..surprise..surprise... \nI had to get a quick bang trim and was told that my appointment was at 7:15.. didn't get seated until 7:45.. just so that she can mess up my bangs.I was charged $20 dollars for a bang and a couple of layers. I am not an expert on cutting hair but the girl that used to trim my bangs back home did not have the same techniques as she did. I wasn't mad since it was my fault anyways that I didn't book elsewhere. Needless to say, I will never go back."
"1","I have shopped at ULTA many times and usually have a decent experience. Not since moving to Henderson though. I use the ULTA rewards and back in California the points accumulate and you may use them towards anything in the store that your little heart desires. That is not the case here, you can only get certain items that you could purchase at target or walmart for cheaper than ULTA offers anyways. Also, the coupons that are frequently in my mailbox offering great savings do NOT work on any of the nice cosmetics I go there to buy, in fact you can't use the coupon on any thing \""high end\"" because they limit the \""Prestige cosmetics and skincare.\""  Its funny because the coupon says prestige then lists some brands but they mean all brands except what you can find at target and walmart as well as ULTA brand you are also not allowed to use the coupon on fragrances. The ULTAs in CA let you use the coupon on most makeup brands and fragrance among many other items in the store that the Henderson stores do not. I'm not really sure why there is such a difference, but my trips to ULTA are limited to what is actually on sale in the ad because the coupons are a joke and the staff is less than pleasant."
"2","Ulta store brand is crap... but they have prestige hair care with a selection that is unbeatable. Shop the liter sale and get joico, matrix, Paul Mitchell and redkin for $15.99 for bottles that sale for $33. They also have a huge hair tools section with a wide range of brands. By lancome here but shop the department stores first for gift with purchase. This location doesn't have clinique."
"1","I work pretty close by this wendys and every time I go there they always get my order wrong and the food is never fresh. It's disappointing ."
"2","Wanted to try out this place since I think I've been to Outback only  once...maybe 10 years ago lol and because they just opened this location last week. Very clean, lots of seating and nice atmosphere.\n\nWe arrived around 5:40 yesterday and they told us the wait was about an hour! Ah! But we wanted to try it so the girl took our name down, told us to come back around 6:10 and we walked to Petsmart. We came back right at 6:10 and seated us after 2 minutes. Nice! Only a 30 minute wait. Our waitress was awesome, I feel bad that I forgot her name but I do remember she was a Brown's fan lol. She was funny, knew the menu, gave us recommendations and probably stopped by our table around 10 times just to make sure we were doing alright, refilling our drinks and making us feel comfortable since the kitchen was really backed up and there was only one bartender. They just opened last week so it's totally understandable that they haven't worked out all the kinks yet.\n\nOnto what we ordered! \nPitcher of Strawberry Peach Sangria: Refreshing, sweet but not like candy and a great deal at $15 since we got 4 glasses worth.\n\nAussie fries: I loove cheese fries with bacon! However these were a 2.5/5. Not that seasoned or that much bacon and the cheese only covered the top layer of fries. Once you got under those top 10 fries, you were left with regular french fries. Wah! I will have to point out though that the bacon we did get wasn't overly cooked to a crisp like most places and I really liked that.\n\n12 oz Ribeye: Boyfriend got this and said it was pretty good. He said it wasn't a perfect medium rare but it was good enough. And he loved the loaded baked potato.\n\nAlice springs chicken + coconut shrimp combo: Yum! I got this and it hit the spot for my calorie loaded craving. Chicken had melted cheese, mushrooms and bacon with a mustard sauce on the side. And the coconut shrimp was good sized, had great flavor and came with a sweet marmalade sauce. I could definitely come back for this.\n\nNo dessert cause we finished around 7:30 and had to catch a movie at 8.\n\nI don't usually go to places like this, I feel like it's just a  step up from chili's, applebee's, or tgif but everything had good sized portions, decent flavor, and service was really good. Will definitely be back when I'm craving this type of food."
"1","This is the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant without ordering. I can understand they're busy but this is ridiculous. My family and I waited at least an hour and did the whole online \""Wait Less\"" thing. I can tell you that's a hunk of bull. When we were finally seated we waited and waited for at least someone to take our drink orders. That didn't happen and only one person came up to us saying they'll be there shortly (hint: we didn't see them again surprise surprise). I think the icing on the cake was a party who got seated AFTER my family got bread. We didn't even get that. \n\nAnyways, I'm disappointed I didn't even get to eat. We'll probably never ever visit this location again."
"1","These people will sell you a car and an extended warranty and tell you that anytime you have an issue you can bring the car in to Carmax and not pay the deductable or anything under the extended warranty. What they don't tell you is that you will be buying a LEMON and anytime that you have an issue (in my case, every other month so far), the service department is too busy to fix the car. They book 2 weeks to 3 weeks out.  You will HAVE to take the car to a dealer and at MINIMUM PAY the deductible EVERYTIME. \n\nBEWARE. The sale was simple, but the warranty and service is not as simple as they make it out to be."
"1","Erin K, is the most rudest car appraisal person that works for carmax, she verbally assaulted me and the vehicle i was trading in. I felt very violated, I made a complaint to the management and nothing was done. I didn't even wait to get the appraisal because I was so upset by the way she and her so called manager treated me. I actually went to another dealership and bought a vehicle that day. People, please don t make the same mistake I did, I would never support a company that would hire and employee such rude people, and then when it is brought to there attention they do nothing about it"
"1","I am a ten plus year veteran with Carmax and have made a total of 6 purchases through various branches of this business. For over ten years I was fully satisfied with them and always gave them good reviews. My credit is not the best because of a horrible divorce I went through but Carmax has always given me a great interest rate. Last year as a matter of fact at this same Henderson location, I purchased a 2007 Toyota Corolla S and got an outstanding interest rate. Well I am here to tell you that Carmax has reached an all-time low because they DO NOT follow through with their promises.\n\nSaturday afternoon my husband and I went to the Henderson Carmax and met George Baker, Carmax Salesperson. He was helpful in directing us to cars that would meet our needs. He asked if we would be trading in our 1994 Ford Ranger in fair condition to put towards the purchase of the car we decided upon - a 2010 Nissan Versa. George promised us that in the event we found a private buyer for the Ranger that offered more than Carmax's $500 assessed trade in value (WITHIN 5 DAYS of the purchase of our Carmax car), that we could in fact get our trade in back from them. We hastily agreed to the low assessed value of $500 with the intention of checking with a potential private buyer we know to see if he wanted it and getting back with George in the event we were offered more. My husband told George that we would get back with him as soon as we knew anything. We put $1000 cash and $1500 (on our VISA bank card via P.O.S transaction) down on the car, in addition to the $500 trade in value for a total of a $3000 deposit on the Nissan Versa. The car's sticker price was $13,700.\n\nMonday morning (Day 3) at work, I got a phone call from the Carmax cash office saying that we would need to go get the car smogged because it \""just\"" expired. \""Smogged? Doesn't the car come with a smog upon purchase?\"", I asked. \""Yes, it does..\"" the office associate explained, \""but it somehow just slipped through the cracks.\"" I was then directed to take time off from work to bring the car into Carmax for a smog before they close at 4pm OR I could go get the car smogged at another smog service provider and get reimbursed.\n\u00a0\nTuesday (Day 4) my husband drove the car to his place of work. He decided to have it smogged at a smog booth close to his work during his lunch break. Upon arrival, the service attendant told him that the Dealer was in fact responsible for the smog by law and that he could not give us the required smog test. At this point we were not feeling very comfortable with the ethics behind this sale. I called Carmax and told them that we were bring the car back because we were still within the 5-Day grace period and we didn't approve of the way things were handled.\n\u00a0\nI was forced to leave work early, do a car switch with my husband and hurry back to Carmax before the cash office closed. Carmax first hassled me about the gas tank not being full, then they slowly processed my return over the period of 3 hours. I asked if our 1994 Ford Ranger trade in was still on the lot so I could get it back since we were told that we could reclaim our trade in as long as it was within 5 days of purchase. Carmax refused to give the Ranger back. They instead gave me a $500 check. I was told that the remainder of my deposit would be mailed to me within 2 weeks, despite their own Policy that states all credit card deposit refunds shall be credited back to the credit card used to make the deposit. They told me that the charge to my VISA was not a credit card transaction. I called my bank and verified that they did in fact make a P.O.S. charge to my VISA card. I threatened to call the police and was getting very upset with the \""manager\"" that was left to deal with me. I asked for the General Manager. They said the General Manager was \""not in today\"" and brushed me off. Our Salesperson was nowhere to be found after this occurrence and no one would give us any sort of reconciliation on matters which were unresolved.\n\nWednesday (Day 5) I sent a text to our salesperson who so conveniently disappeared during my battle with the Carmax cash office, explaining to him that Carmax was refusing to give us our Ford Ranger back regardless of what was promised. I asked him what was going on. His exact reply was, \""(1/2) If I knew in advance that your plan was to take advantage of a possible return re-purchase, then I would've partnered with a manager concerning your trade. (2/2) I was unaware that it would be a straight return which means the trade goes through our normal processing and may not be at our dealership.\""\n\nTake advantage of a possible return re-purchase? How would we have even known that Carmax was going to sell us an unsmogged car? Why would you not prepare for something other than the \""straight return\"" after making a promise like that? Clearly, we are criminals plotting to take advantage of Carmax.\n\nThis ten year customer has walked out of Carmax for the last time."
"1","Purchased hummer 1yr ago at carmax. Excellent service but my problem is with Maxcare extended warranty they sell. Purchased the best they had. GM dealer had to go back and fourth with them to fix the issue. Then they send someone from Maxcare to inspect  vehicle issues which is another two days. Inspector denied covered item and I was only told axel was not leaking and it was only seapage and 4x4 switch issue denied as well. GM didn't understand why I was denied.  Few days later I get notice that they will not cover my h2 hummer any more because I put on different set of wheels on it or at least cover anything that they believe issues relates due to wheels. There the same size rim and tire as stock.  That's the real reason they denied those items. The sale person told me I can modify hummer and Maxcare would still cover and was giving nothing saying that I would not be covered if hummer modified. Immediately canceled Maxcare.  Maxcare was a big part of the reason why I would send friends to Carmax. Not anymore, sorry carmax."
"2","I've only been here once, but I will definitely go back. It was a while back but I had been searching the area for something  more in the lines of comfort foods. After googling and searching yelp, I read a few reviews and looked over their menu. It sounded like it was close to what I was looking for so I  headed over after work. \n\nFood - I got an open face roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy, as well as, some chicken noodle soup. The soup was pretty good, but the best part was the HUGE plate of roast beef and mashed potatoes. They were the warm, yummy comforting food I was in a search for that day. I totally left happy. \n\nService - It was just a touch slow but the kid was pretty friendly and brought things out in a fairly quick manner. The only reason it was slow was that he was the ONLY person there and there were quite a few tables. I tried to be patient as I've been there and it kinda is hard.\n\nI know this is a jewish deli so I totally need to go in for bagels one day, but I haven't had the time or thought. It's hard to find a place in the city with any semblance of comfort food so this place is a good alternative when I'm wanting mashed potatoes and warm yummy goodness. It's not the plate lunch places of the South, but it's a good substitution."
"2","Like going home.   I was raised in New York and I know deli.   This place is the real deal.  Great breakfasts, terrific soup and amazing sandwiches.   The breads are fresh and everything tastes like home!   We came back three times while in Vegas even though we had to drive clear across the city.  Warm, wonderful owners who are still excited about their trade.    Just go!"
"2","Oh my lord- East coast Jewish delis are amazing, and this place can holds its own with the best of them. As soon as I saw the menu here, I started (favorably) comparing it to Miller's on Polk Street in SF, where I first had matzo ball soup.\n\nThe soup here, which we started with, is just as legit. And the portions are just as huge, too- the one pictured is a cup. It could easily be a lunch, and is served with a couple of tasty-ass bagel chips too. Rye flavor, natch.\n\nBF opted for one of the most expensive (and largest) sandwiches ever, the JR Boucher, which is a triple-layer with pastrami and liver. Yeah, that didn't sound tasty to me at all, and it's $18. But we got it, and it's frickin' delicious: all the components work so well together, they harmonize like a choir of angels. Oh and one sandwich is easily like three meals. We shared it and still had half for dinner.\n\nAnd, because I'm a total glutton and never on this side of town, I had to get my own dish, too. I got the Ceily's stack- latkes stuffed with brisket, topped with two types of cheese and brown gravy. It's even more amazing than it sounds, priced at $12, and is also easily split into thirds. Just finished my order for lunch today.\n\nWith two heavy take-out boxes in hand, we rolled ourselves out the door... And promptly axed any plans of looking for a rental property in Henderson, because I don't want to weigh 400 pounds and if this place were nearby, that might be a serious possibility."
"2","Excellent in every aspect.  Had the White Fish platter, comes with 2 bagels, cream cheese,choice of salads,6 sliced tomatoes, capers, green and black olives, lettuce, pickle, etc.  Too much.. will be back without a doubt.  $16.95"
"2","Amazing. Customer service is the best and I will be returning for gift baskets each time I have a need. I was surprised that they give you such large samples of their bread. And it was delicious. The baskets hey custom made for us were affordable and very professional. Good job guys."
"2","My fiance and I like this place.  He always gets the fish and chips, which really are some of the best we've had.  I haven't really had anything bad on the menu.  The prices seem about right for as much as you get, and the service is good.  We enjoy Village Pub."
"1","I like American Eagle's jeans.  I, however, do NOT like this AE location.\n\nI always feel like I'm inconveniencing the sales associates by asking to try something on.  When I ask for a fitting room, I'm greeted with eye-rolling and huffing.  I'm sorry you're busy.  That's what having a job entails - actually doing work.  And the reason you have a job is because I shop at AE.  So you can get me a fitting room when I ask nicely.  Once, I actually had a female salesperson tell me that, no, she's too busy to get me a fitting room.  Really?!  If that's someone else's job, direct me to that person.  Don't just say no and turn your back to me.  That's so rude."
"2","Philly cheese steak omelet Was amazing!  I like am usually disappointed with omlets, they taste too commercial.  But this tasted awesome!  \n\nThe waitress was ok, nothing worth writing about!  As long as my food was good!  That's what is important to me!"
"2","Love the phone application to make yoqur reservation on your way to the salon... my son got a great haircut ... I will come back, when I am in town... Veronica is WONDERFUL!"
"1","I omitted to mention that the attitude stemmed from the fact that we did not have a local number, just the hotel's phone number. Apparently that was a problem for them and flat out refused to place our order when we, in fact, had done so the night before. We also told hotel management as they do a lot of business with them. What a way to ruin an otherwise amazing stay!"
"1","Serviceable pizza.  I would eat it if it were offered at a party but I would not be enthusiastic about it."
"1","I was extremely disappointed when ordering pizza from this place. The girl that rang up our order said it would be 20-25 minutes for our pizza and garlic knots to be done. We sat down to wait. After 45 minutes of waiting my husband went up to inquire about our food. They said the pizza was still in the oven. We were so irritated that we asked for a refund and then left. We never got to even try the pizza, but with customer service like that I'm sure the food isn't much better. I will never order pizza from here again."
"1","I ordered a pizza and was expecting it to be a bit of a wait because it was the weekend. 2 hours later and I still did not have my pizza. I called the restaurant and they were so confused and told me that my pizza wasn't even ready. I was so angry that I had to cancel my order. I understand it's a big city but come on...2 hours..?!! That is insane and unacceptable. I will not be using them again."
"2","We needed a place to get our kitty Sadie spayed and we had heard many good things about the GVAH. We picked Dr. P as our Vet! She is so knowledgeable and friendly. All the nurses are also very helpful and friendly. You can tell they really care about the animals. Sadie is now recovering from her operation. Dr. P did a wonderful job. She gave her internal stitches so we do not have to return. She also prescribed her some kitty pain meds which I thought was wonderful!\n\n My kitties are my babies and I totally trust Dr. P and her staff with my cats. She even said she would see our guinea pigs if they need any help! \n\nThey have affordable prices, but they do not bill! It is also very clean and sterile. GVAH has plenty of staff, but needs a few more patient rooms. That would be my only gripe is I had to wait a while to get into a room so they could bring Sadie to me after her operation. But not even that big of deal. The Dr. and staff make up for it ten fold! I will for sure recommend them to anyone with a pet and will be bringing back my other cat Sam for a check-up and booster shots."
"1","How long has it been since you tried to get gas somewhere that doesn't have the option to pay at the pump?  \nNot only are they living in the stone age with gas station technology- the line was long, and no wonder. \nWe wanted to fill the tank of our rental car.  We had to guess at the amount. If we guessed too much it meant another wait in line. Too little means we left with a tank not full.  Since you can't take a rental car back like that, we ended up stopping at another gas station to finish the job.\nWhat a waste of time.\nThe clerk was pleasant- but she must get constantly hounded by those who aren't frequent customers.\nOne has to wonder why Chevron allows their name to be muddied by an outlet too cheap to upgrade their technology."
"2","I took a chance and stopped here to get a quick oil change.  I was pleasantly surprised.\nFirst, the entire process took less than 30 minutes from arrival.  Second, the price was excellent.  Third, you get a free car wash and fountain drinks/coffee just for purchasing an oil change.\nMy service was done by Kerry, and I cannot recommend him enough.  He was nice, knowledgeable, and didn't find things \""wrong\"" with my car like other places tend to.  Great experience all around!"
"2","I went for breakfast and ordered a Quiche Florentine.  It was very good.   I also got the 3 different juices with the small bottle of champagne.  That was really quite fun and refreshing."
"1","Bleech. Welcome to the chain that Sysco loves. If you love uninspired, bland, boring food that helps give chain restaurants their hated reputation you've found the right place. If you like waits due to slow or no service this is your place. If you really want to see someone try and create a faux New Orleans environment and come up woefully short at the feeble attempt, this is your place. About the closest this would come to New Orleans would be Slidell, LA style. Slidell is a small city just North of Lake Pontchartrain and I'll just leave that slam hanging...\n\nI would much rather eat late 1970's high school cafeteria food than be forced to choke down what is served here. And if you want a \""New Orleans\"" experience with your food you're better off finding your closest Popeye's Chicken for something that's Louisiana fast vs. the stuff they bring to your table, which in the case of this Henderson location is usually: A: Cold  B: Not what you ordered C: Overpriced for what you get. Pick 2 of those choices on almost every visit. \n\nHow this chain has proliferated is a testament to Sysco's ability to keep bulk food prices down, and for people to tolerate crappy food and even crappier service. \n\nIn short, you would be better off scouring Yelp for the absolute worst Las Vegas casino buffet and going there vs. eating here. At least there's Walgreens and CVS's close by for the Pepto and Tagamet you'll need after the fact. And as I'm writing this I realized it's not far from the Mongolian grill that made me sick too. Is there something about the East side of Stephanie, just South of Sunset that is destined to have crappy food? I'm beginning to wonder."
"1","Generic breakfast menu in a generic atmosphere attempting to impersonate a French country cabin.\n\nFor breakfast, Mimi's Cafe offers what is essentially a diner menu with some upscale dishes (quiche, variety of baked goods).  Nothing's awful here, but nothing I've had off the menu is particularly inspired or interesting.  The egg dishes are well-prepared and the sausage was good enough, but there's not much seasoning--nothing to distinguish the breakfast dishes from any diner in any city.\n\nBottom line: there's a lot better breakfast in this city, but I guess you could do a lot worse."
"1","We are regulars and the French Makeover and taking things off the menu has made us go a lot less often. They took bananas, red apples and carrots off the menu, They have virtually nothing for kids there that kids like.  I guess kids are now longer welcome in the FRENCH restaurant.  Our kids used to LOVE to go there. Management is rarely seen and they seem to gossip alot about the other staff.  Nothing is consistent anymore, the excuse is the cooks vary in ability. What is left on the menu has hokey French names and every little thing is EXTRA. This was a restaurant that was like a neighborhood meeting place prior to the French takeover.  Unfortunately, we are looking for a new favorite neighborhood restaurant. We need one less stuffy that has a manager that you can actually talk to Anthony used to walk around from time to time but not anymore. Haven't seen his face in over a year, when I ask for him the staff says he is not there. Assistant managers seem to all pass the buck except Kathy and the team leaders seem to be above doing the little extras when you ask them for something. I must say Steve, Justin, Christine, Maureen, Etla, and Leah all are wonderful .Wifi is VERY slow.  Never see management out and about like you do at other restaurants. I guess that is a sign that they don't want to hear why their customers have to say."
"1","make sure you check the price on the shelf AND when they ring you up. very misleading and disappointing."
"1","Dear Enzo's,\n\nI love you.  You, your food, and your humble decor and atmosphere.  I feel like we've gotten to know each other quite well.  After all, I have been eating your food for as long as I can remember (at least 20 years).  I'm very fond of the memories I have with you.  However, Enzo's, if you are rude to me or my husband, one more time, I will probably never come back ever again.  I understand that there may be an east meets west kind of out-of-syncness with our communication, I get it.  I really do.  But you complained about us, in front of us, because we didn't give you the coupon at the exact time when you preferred it.  Never mind that I have been coming here for 20 years or that we simply didn't know.  You don't make eye contact, you don't say hello or thank you.  When I ask a question, the answer is half-assed and un-helpful.  \n\nEnzo's, your food is terrific.  The value is terrific.  I hold sentimental value in your establishment.  But your service of late, steals every bit of pleasure from our meals.  It tarnishes the memories.  It makes the food taste bitter.  \n\nI really don't want to break up with you Enzo's, but in case you didn't know there are a lot of new players in the locally-owned delicious Italian food genre.  Some might even have better food than yours.  If you were nice to me, I wouldn't even think about it.  But as of right now, they are looking like my next choice."
"1","Pizza is very good, havent tried anything else yet, however their service is just as bad as most new yorkers, they charge 50CENTS for refills! bunch of cheapskates! only on the strip you can get away with that!"
"1","Video link at bottom review. Worst service I have ever had. I am 22 years old I don't want to be treated with any disrespect because I wear a hat. I have lived here for 5 days and new to the area they will really short with me had an a problem because I did not understand there menu and had to ask for a menu. No help at all. So on top if the bad service the pizza was horrible. I called Enzo back (the owner) to say I was unhappy with the pizza and service and her swore and yelled on the phone. So I went in to talk to him and he swore at me in person telling me to f****n leave. Only wanted to pay me back for half the price. Worst place I have been to here in the area. I have a video of him yelling at me.  He refused to give me his name and wanted to hear nothing I had to say.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuq5w_GpZTo&feature=youtu.be please check it out."
"2","Great food, pretty good beer by Brewmaster Bubba. Always a good time for NFL games! Love being able to drink Vegas craft beer while watching the Patriots!"
"1","We came here on a Wednesday night and ordered at the bar \n1. NY steak and potato - 10\n2. Mahi Mahi - 10 \nUsed the $10 Groupon for $20 to cover the meals and left $3. \n\n- Brewer's closed at 8pm, so we went to the bar instead. \n- This place is also a Station Casino. A lot smaller scale.  \n- Service was very friendly. \n- Initially, I wanted the prime rib, but the waitress said they were all out that night. fail. \n- This place can't cook a steak. I asked for a Medium and they gave me a Rare. Manager came and said they would make another. This time I asked for Medium well hoping that it would be easier, but they gave be a tough well done! I didn't want the chef to go through the hassle and making another one. \n- Ahi Ahi was bland. Add your own salt and pepper. But expected since labeled healthy choice. \n- Potato was boring. I can make a better potato at the Feast buffet! \n- Although the service was very good, the food was very sub par. Cooking steak should be mastered 101 for a chef"
"1","I didn't really like it. The service was slow & their panang curry was just weird. Probably wouldn't go back."
"1","If you don't know what Thai food tastes like, you just won't know what you're missing. This is definitely NOT a real Thai restaurant."
"2","Decided to stop by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by this little mom n pop.\n\nThe restaurant isn't too big, couple of tables in the middle flanked by four booths on each side. Bangkok Orchid seems to be family run which is usually means you get better and more personalized service. Coming in during lunch, it was great to a wide selection of lunch specials priced at $5.95.\n\nI had the chili mint chicken level 8, crab ragoons, and a thai iced tea with boba. My entree, the chili mint comes in a little bento box style plate, complete with salad, a scoop of rice, a eggroll, egg drop soup, and a generous portion of the chicken. The chicken is delicious; very similar to what you would find in the lettuce wrap filling at PF Changs. But I will say that level 8 isn't as spicy as it sounds.\n\nThe crab ragoons were great, about 8 small empanda style ragoons stuffed with imitation grab and cream cheese. A perfect appetizer. My thai iced tea was pretty good but it would been nicer if it was a little bigger for the $3 they charged for it. \n\nOverall Bangkok Orchid is a great gem for anyone looking for Asian fare. Definitely check it out."
"1","Dr Sina is RUDE. She has the highest turnover in staff I have ever seen. If u get a second opinion the work is never extensive as dr Sina says. Horrible bedside manner. Don't take your child here. Office is dirty looking too."
"2","When there are sales, it is best to get your butt in gear and get to the store. Right now they are having an up to 75% sale. Kenneth Cole and Calvin Klein are some names that gets me motivated. \n\nTwo dress shirts and a light pullover sweater by these big name designers only cost me $42. Everyone loves to save money and look good while doing so. Although Macy's can be expensive, if you are patient, the savings are monumental."
"1","Thought I would try something new, but I will stick to my restaurant.  \n\nThey have great service - greet you at the door, and are attentive when placing your order. I ordered pad Thai, which maybe was not a good choice.\n\nIt was very bland.  Very, very bland. So much so I had to throw it back in the fire, add some of my own stuff to add some flavor.  Never had I done that before, but I guess there's a first for everything.  My mom enjoyed her food though.  Maybe it was just my food, but that was my first time there, and not a great food experience.  I'll give it a shot one more time.  Based upon some of the other reviews, the food is good, so I'm willing to try it again."
"1","This place is a restaurant right??? THEN FIX THE DARN FOOD!\nThe food is mediocre at best. Wings are 3\"" of breading around 1 millimeter of meat. Hamburgers were all greasy and lopsided on the bun and gave us terrible upset stomachs.\n\nAs for service...sure it's nice to look at 21 year old waitresses in skimpy clothing. BUT... the waitress decided to take our order and not write anything down just did it by memory. So of course when our order came it was completely wrong. Then she gave us an attitude problem. After food was delivered she disappeared until we were ready to leave.\n\nSorry, I won't eat here again. We spent over $100 for food that was no better than what you would get off the McDs dollar menu."
"1","I have spent nearly a total of 7 nights and over 5 hrs with different people trying to resolve connectivity issues. Every different person suggests something else to be done including upgrading speed and purchasing diff modems. The service breaks up and is intermittent. Too bad they are the better of the rest of the providers."
"1","Wally world a necessary evil.  it has low prices and pretty much everything you need. Customer service is hit and miss, it's rare to find a cashier that looks happy to be there. However there is a young man in electronics who always goes above and beyond. The store is open 24/7 so if you work late you can still go shopping."
"2","I've been to this DSW on numerous occasions. I've purchased boots, running shoes, sandals, and even house slippers here. I've also bought socks and even a wallet on my past ventures. \n\nI think the store is well kept, bright and clean like all DSW's of course. I love the way DSW has their shoes at the level of your hip, so you can see the shoes clearly. \n\nMost recently my mother purchased a pair of Nike shoes for my brother for Christmas, but unfortunately it was the incorrect shoe. We took them back and the employees were more than happy to issue a refund with no problems. While we were there I bought a new pair of Rocket Dog slippers for $29.99. I love cheap shoes!\n\nI kind of flip flop about whether or not DSW truly deserves 5 stars, but so many of my trips here have ended in success with no problems that I feel I must say it is as good as it gets in shoe purchasing."
"1","Overall - Poor service, poor attitude, poor follow up, but... good selection,knowledgeable sales staff and good prices.\n\n1.  Experience -Been to this place for a long time and have spent each year at least 1000-1500.\n\n2.  Selection - I am hard on clothes and travel alot. The quality of their products I am very happy with. You have to spend a bit to get quality stuff.\n\n3.  Quality - Their own brand, Pronto Uomo, is very good overall and will wear well and look great. You cannot go wrong here.\n\n4.  Tailoring - They will tailor and alter everything to fit you perfectly, and once you tailor something, you can have it altered in future for free.\n\n5.  Service - Their current staff is not up to task unfortunately. I have gone there three times to order the same shoes I purchased there before. They did not have it in stock, so they called to another store and had it sent to their store. They would put me on a list to call and then never call me. I would call in and they do not call back. I waited 4 weeks and finally ordered it on-line from Amazon and got it in 3 days. They lost my sale. I wanted to buy from Men's Wearhouse, but they didn't care.\n\n6.  Tux Rental - I am afraid that you will have no choice but to use them as they are the largest and most recognized in town. However they suffer from not being organized, not having a good process for customer service and not helping the long lines properly. They have a numbering and sign in sheet, and only half of the staff will work it, while the others just help whomever shows up. Iris the manager will bypass it and then when you complain, she ignores you. You will see 10 people waiting to get fitted for tuxedos, and 7 staff, with only 3 of them working the tux people. Yet all 7 at one time you will see help others with tux fittings, so it is odd to see more than 50% of the staff standing around at the front desk jabbering while the client line is not worked....\n\n7.  I got frustrated there and mentioned my concerned which led to the staff person helping me there simply going on break immediately without advising me, the manager ignoring me, and one kind staff helping me.\n\nI do not enjoy spending thousands at a store yearly and then they treat me like this, so I will not be back, but for all of you, the quality of selection, and the knowledge of the staff has been good up till 2010, so maybe they just do not like me. I would suggest you still try this place and buy stuff, but I will not any longer as it is too painful."
"1","When we went to get my husband fitted and to pick tux and color schem for the groomsmen to rent for our wedding, the guy who help us was so nice and pleasant. He's very helpful and very patient.  Thats the only reason why i rate them two stars.. Because when we returned the tuxes we rented, the woman that was checking all the stuff gave my husband an attitude just because we didnt put the stuff nicely back in the bag. I dont think we have to put it back nicely cause we pay $200 anyway. I will never recommend this place to anyone.."
"2","I have been here many times...and the table service has always sucked. Its kinda something you expect when you come here. Like that one friend that you still go out with even thought they always do something stupid. What I would suggest when you go there is try to sit at the sushi bar, but even then it can be really slow. Even if you are the only ones there. Or it just opened.Or pretty much for any reason..you are going to wait. But when you get it, it's delicious and you don't care anymore, and you go back. and bring people. and then go online and yelp about it. yum, What I get is now all I get, I know I should try to get other stuff..but these are just so good: \nthe no name handroll, the stacie cut roll (get 2 even),the moon roll, and the green mussels and a side of ponzu with it all. Dayum."
"1","This is the last time I'm coming to this location. I thought maybe after my last bad service visit that I would give it a go. I asked to sit outside and they didn't have a server for us. waited ten minutes and had ask the people on break to get some one, the patio was littered with trash on the tables just sitting there. I like red robin but not this location. Customer lost."
"1","went yesterday afternoon (5/7/2014) to this location. my fiance took me here because i wanted to try something new and this literally was my VERY first time EVER going to a Red Robins and probably my last because the service I received was just that horrible. \nthe restaurant was pretty slow so we got there and waited to be seated. which took much longer than usual considering how dead it was at this time of day. the server (i believe his name was Tye) did not even greet us, instead just escorted us to our table with a very unfriendly and unapproachable attitude. when he did take our orders, he just seemed like he hated his job; his tone was very monotonous, straight forward and very rushed with no eye contact whatsoever as if he was talking to the wall next to our booth. as much as we thought he hated his job, the crazy thing was when he want in the back towards the kitchen with the other employees, he was cracking jokes and having what looked like  a really good time with his co-workers, but as soon as he stepped back into server mode, he seemed miserable.\nI will say the food was pretty good, hence the one star, but we did rush to eat and regrettably had no dessert because we just wanted to leave; it was that unpleasant, and we honestly took it very personal.\nthis was my VERY FIRST review, and I never do this, but the service there to me was that unpleasant to break that chain!"
"2","Good food ! Jesus is an excellent waiter and he is on top of his game. We did not need to ask for anything"
"1","Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly."
"1","Bad service. Very unorganized.  As soon as we walked in the door 4 people front the front disappeared to the back and we waited for 10min until someone come out and I know they saw us we made eye contact."
"1","Don't know where/how to start this review - I will start with, if you can find ANY other place to send your family members for care, it would be in your best interest to do so.  My moms insurance company gave her no choice to go here.  Repeatedly I arrive to visit her and she is in a wet diaper and has been for a very long time due to the smell. I lost my cool and a nice person (wish I could remember her name, great smile, not a nurse, someone with authority) told me should would find someone to help.  She stopped a man in the hall and he gave her instructions to find a nurse.  Later I found out this man was the ADMINISTRATOR and he passed my need for help onto someone else.  In a nutshell, don't bother making a complaint the director of nursing will NOT return phone calls. Her name is Donna and the nurse who told me her name told me not to tell anyone that she told me her name as she would be fired. I could go on but it makes me more angry to think about it. Positves, clean facility, allows healthy pets to visit, decent food. Cons, unhappy nurses, poor care, no one who can help will listen at the management level."
"1","After being admitted to this facility my elderly friend received a few days treatment and then was constantly badgered to sign into a hospice facility called Solari. She was told by TLC that she could stay there up to 100 days. Then suddenly, after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leave...period, no notice. Once again the Solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in Solari. Moved her the following day. TLC on site social worker was usually no where to be found and never returned her calls or the many pages the receptionist made for her stating \""I know she's here, I don't know why she's not responding\"".\nAvoid this place at any costs!"
"2","This place is the Oyster Bar inside Sunset Station. Alot of parking outside and inside garage.\nService was fast and got great service from Julian at the bar. Anthony is them man. \nSit at the bar just say how you want it and magic happens. Food was great on this visit and portions were right on. \nPlus cocktails right there no wait.\nReasonable prices and great portions of food with great quality and taste.\nHave fun and enjoy."
"2","Sometimes you just don't want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out. Cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions. Last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that we've become accustomed to. Our server, Daniel flat knows how to move things along and once again he took great care of us. I didn't have to ask for refills on my drink, and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before I even started to get up to head to the salsa bar for more. It's the little things. They make a huge difference. And with a 2 year old along when making the tableside guacamole he didn't just assume what ingredients should be left out. He asked. That was appreciated. \n\nIn short, another solid 4 star experience. It's not 5 stars, but sometimes you don't want 5 stars, you want consistent 4 star, rock solid food and a hassle free experience. Cabo delivers that for us. \n\nOne tip: On the AYCE tacos, be aware of the restrictions. No sharing, no doggie bags, batteries not included. Oops, scratch the last one. Still we ordered the non AYCE tacos. Only was able to eat 2 anyway. Just thought I'd share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy. In that case order away. It just means I have time to get to the salsa bar before you do! \n\nOne last thing: The mobile app should show more check-ins, not sure what is up with that."
"1","Went there last night in hopes of finding some decent Mexican Food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. First of all, the service was lacking. It took us asking twice to just get a container of salt to the table. Also, the waitress was less than interested in helping us with anything more than taking our order. \n\nSecond, the food was atrocious. You know you have an issue if you need to add salt to Mexican food. The rice was dry (almost hard and old) and completely tasteless. The beans were bland and tasted like paste. There was barely any cheese in the enchilada I had. My husband's tacos wee haphazardly put together, falling over and impossible to pick up, and needless to say did not taste good. \n\nThe only saving grace was the shredded beef burrito and the Tomatillo-Avocado salsa. No, I will not be going back, even with the Yelp offer."
"2","Very pretty inside!  Great prices!  The service was a little slow, but the food was great!  The tortilla soup was my fav!  The chicken fajitas are only $8.99 with your players boarding pass!  They also have a nice sized salsa bar with a great selection of salsas, from mild to extra hot!  You really cant beat it with the price and taste of food!"
"1","We went here because we had a coupon.  Upon arrival we were told there would be a 30 minute wait for a table.  They took my cell number to call me when the table was ready.  They did call within the time and seated us.  We waited for 5 minutes before we were acknowledged after seated.  \n\nFinally the server came and offered us a drink.  We ordered our drink and the insulate italiano.  He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted appetizers.  We stated we ordered one already which he then remembered.  We gotordered the saladfood which wasis actually veryunder good.  When we finally got the chance to order dinner, my wife ordered the grilled chicken caprese and I ordered the rigatoni with sausage.  Her chicken was over cooked, dry and the sauce very bland.  My plate, the pasta was good, the sausage which is not made in house was not too bad.  The meatballs were actually under cooked and raw in the very center.  The sauce was ok, not spectacular, I make a better sauce at home.\n\nThe server was ok, not the best we ever had but not the worst.  This is not a place we will go back too.  There are much better itilian places to eat which are comparable in price and the food is made in house and cooked properly. Again, the server tried his best and when we let him know about the food he did take her order off the bill and was very understanding.  He definitely had a desire to see the place he works do better."
"1","Sales is a joke.\n\nIf there is one thing I hate most, it is liars. \n\nLost a sale but oh well...\n\nEnded up purchasing from BMW of Las Vegas.  Thank you BMW of Las Vegas for not BULLSHITTING."
"1","This review is long, but you are likely to save yourself weeks of wasted time and frustration by reading it.\nWe wanted to replace our sectional and unfortunately stopped at this branch of Ashley Furniture. A sales associate noticed that we weren't really enthusiastic about anything and mentioned to us that there was a big sale coming up. We did the math and based on the savings, waited a few days for the sale and bought the sectional plus a dresser and a chest on December 18th. \nWe were in no particular rush to receive any of the items and asked when we could expect delivery of the furniture for planning purposes only. The sales associate checked the computer and advised us that Jan. 02nd would be possible. Just to emphasize a point here, this was her suggestion not our request. We made arrangements with a moving company to come in and remove our old, huge sectional before Ashley's scheduled delivery. On December 30th, 2013, a few days before scheduled delivery, we got a call from Ashley customer service (I think customer disservice is a more fitting name) advising us that they would not be able to deliver as promised, but would now need to reschedule for Jan 09th, 2014. The delay wasn't a huge issue. However, the agent had a disclaimer \""subject to further delay\"". That caught our attention and we decided to revisit the store to investigate further.\nInterestingly, when we called to cancel the pick-up of our old sectional, the lady on the phone was quite familiar with Ashley and their delays. Her exact words were \""Oh, it's Ashley. It happens all the time\"". This is not an isolated event.\nWe asked for a manager and after a brief delay, we were introduced to Alex. He listened, checked the computer and then advised us of a few things:\n- We'd need to call customer service (again) on our own. There was nothing that he could do. \n- If he tried to use internal channels to communicate within Ashley, the company he works for, it would be of less use than if we called in ourselves. He said that they give us, the customers, higher priority.  If that's true, I can't imagine how low his priority would be as it is clear to us that we don't matter to customer service. It felt more like passing the buck to get us out of the store.\nAs a last ditch effort before leaving the store, we asked which piece was not in stock. An agent checked the computer and realized that it was just one piece of the sectional- everything else was there. After some back and forth, we got them to agree that if there were any further delays, that we would be happy to receive the pieces that they already had in stock on the Jan 9th with the missing piece delivered at a later date. Alex gave us his word that we would not be charged a second $79.99 delivery fee. He assured us that the second fee would be taken care of and if there were any other problems, just give him a call. \nOn January 06th, 2014 my wife called Ashley customer disservice to see if everything was OK.  They advised her that there was going to be another delay. My wife explained to the customer disservice representative what happened and asked about delivery of the pieces that they had in stock. She said she'd have to clear that with a manager and get back to us. When she called back, she advised that it would not be possible to make two separate deliveries. \nMy wife decided to go see Alex at the store. This chameleon showed his true colors today. He was gruff, irritated and even more unhelpful. He regurgitated his favorite line \""there's nothing I can do\"", this time without the fa\u00e7ade of caring about the customer. To make things worse, when he checked the computer system to see which piece was causing the delay, he advised my wife that now two pieces of the sectional were out of stock. My wife was shocked. She asked how was that possible. He did not give a clear answer. However, the inference here is that they delivered the piece to another customer. \nThat was the last straw for us. We realized that we might have waited until March 2014 (or later) for delivery if Ashley ever thought highly enough of us to eventually deliver the items that we paid for. I asked my wife to request a refund. While relaying the request to Alex, my wife started to say to him that even though I would like a refund, she is not quite ready to give up. Alex cut her off mid-sentence and without even the pretense of caring, Alex started the refund process. My wife, out of curiosity, asked what does he think about Yelp reviews. As he turned his back on her and walked away, he said quite clearly \""I don't believe in those things\""."
"1","Low rating due to customer service issues not furniture. Sales person lied about what was in stock rather being honest about back ordered sofa. Stated it was in AZ ready for delivery then a week later after the sale I find out it was actually on back order. Instantly lost me because of lies. Still love my sofa and love seats. Quality is good. When the couch was ready they have me the wrong one. So the low rating was mainly due to poor processes and customer service rather than the furniture. This was the second purchase at Ashley. The first time was smoother with no issues."
"2","Update: \nEmailed 2 weeks ago, did not get a reply or call. .\n\nDid receive a message from Chris H and asked me to resend my email which I did today.  Will update outcome.\n\n*** Final Update - 7/27/2014 ***\n\nAfter a week of exchanging emails with Chris H., he personally re-evaluated and has honored our warranty claim and they offered a in store credit since our product is no longer available. \n\nChris H was very diligent and followed through on researching our claim and kept us updated each step of the way."
"1","Oh no......my ice maker is on the fritz.....no ice. I google appliance repair in Vegas because my old go-to company have disappeared. Sears? Household name.....you can book online. Sounds good right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe guy arrives after a phone call to verify what type of ice maker , freestanding or in the fridge. Good guy , clean , polite and capable. On the website they say $70  for estimate. \n\nThe guy identifies a bad pump, this is where you have to trust your guy. New pump or can you clean out/fix the old one. What do you think he said? \n\nObvious . \n\n\""New pump and I've got it on the van\"" \n\n\"" what a surprise!\"" .\n\nHe then logs into his laptop \"" $506\"" says the guy.  \n\n WTF? \n\nThe pump is $225 plus labor, tax etc!!!!!\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nSo if you want to be completely ripped off by a company, Sears are highly recommended, this is not a dig at the repair guy, he just works for these clowns. The job was quickly completed and I now have ice but my goodness, I think I could have flown to the Arctic circle with a cooler, chipped some ice out of a glacier and flown home for less money. BEWARE."
"1","About as bad as it gets. I have two service contracts that contracted with sears, both times the service tech went to the wrong address and refused to call to verify address.  After almost an hour on hold, sears off shore rep could only schedule a repair almost a week later.  Sears is terrible, stay away."
"2","My girlfriend has an allergy to gluten. And this place is heaven. Gluten free bread for the sandwiches. Gluten free croutons for the salad. \nAnd the service is amazing. Everyone is helpful,  smiling, and best of all... proactive.  When my soda choice was out, I was standing there trying to decide my 2nd choice. A young man came up to me and asked if I needed anything. I wasn't even disappointed that they didn't have it, but he speed what he was doing and went and fixed the soda. Excellent service. \nWish the managers that train this staff would show how they do it."
"1","With Reference TO:\nDr. James Gabroy\n1535 W Warm Springs Rd\nHenderson, NV 89014 \n(702) 450-3385 \n,\n\nAfter feeling progressively worse, my family forced me to go for a second opinion.\n\nI advised my doctor, Dr. James Gabroy,  who I've seen each and every month for the last 15+ years, that I was going to do this and have any/all findings forwarded to him.\n\nAfter not receiving my usual courtesy appointment  reminder call, I called to confirm.  I was put on hold for quite some time and then politely advised that \""The Doctor no longer wishes to care for me and has released not only me from his care, but my entire family\""!   We are absolutely devastated.  The doctors REJECT list includes my 85-year-old father, my spouse and my two children ages 24 and 25.\n\nMy advise to you,  going to Dr. Gabroy is a fantastic idea if your NOT sick!!\n  Just be prepared to sit in the waiting area for 3+ hours for your appointments and pray that you don't get sick enough that you might need a second opinion, because if you do go for a second opinion, you and your family will be thrown out on your asses!!!"
"2","Fast great food. Amazing friendly staff. Delicious cookies! Will return and recommend."
"1","Good thai tea!\n\nHorrible food. Pad thai look like it was food colored and the noodle stick together. Salted fried chicken was too dry. \n\nWould not recommend."
"2","I decided to stop here because it was sort of close by and I have passed it a million times. \n\nIm glad I stopped by. \n\nAgain I know Im in the right place with Im surrounded by Asian patrons. I had the lunch special which was 5.99. \n\nThe soup was rich and flavorful for chicken soup. \n\nI had the cashew nut delight with squid and it was really delicious. \n\nThe thai iced  tea was great. I have never had it before and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI will be back"
"2","I have eaten here for lunch and for dinner and have even called in orders and taken there food home. I enjoy it every time the food is always good. Prices are great and you never go away hungry. The people are always friendly and thankful. Will be back."
"1","So we were in the shopping center and he decided that since I like Thai food, we would go here. I was hoping they had improved since my last visit. Service was good, food is not with returning for. The pad Thai was so sticky clumps of it dangled from the fork for over a minute- kind of like that dried out spaghetti on a buffet, looked like & even tasted like rubber bands. Maybe 5 pieces of green onion in the whole dish (less than a full green onion) which made it extremely bland. \nEven the wide rice noodles in the spicy Thai noodle were rubbery. I know it is not just me when he says \""the food is s**t here\"". I do believe this is the worst Thai restaurant we've ever been to. Maybe since the employees are Chinese. Guaranteed not to give them another try for 3 strikes."
"1","This is only a review for the Thai dishes, which were all mediocre at best. Pad See Ew had very little flavor, same with the Tom Kha Kai soup. Red curry was watery and flavorless. But at least the service was friendly."
"2","Charlotte Russe has become one of my go-to stores when I need something cute and trendy to wear, but want to have some money left in my wallet when I am done. \n\nI have found some killer deals here... During one post-holiday sale I snagged a pair of cute shorts for $7.50, an adorable top for $5 and another cute tank for $3! All of these were on the clearance rack with higher prices, but ended up being an additional 50% off... Gotta love when that happens!!\n\nI really love their shoe selection, lots of fun colors and trendy styles at really affordable prices... Last time I was in the deal was buy one at regular price (usually around $30) get another pair for $10! \n\nA warning: This store seems to have an issue with defective accessories. I recently wanted to get a pair of cute hoop earrings with pink rhinestones but many of the stones were missing, and it was the only pair they had in stock. Be sure to check over the accessories carefully before purchasing. The quality of the rest of the clothing is ok, not great but not awful.\n\nThe sales associates I have dealt with have always been pleasant, even the times when they have had to tell me that discounts or coupons couldn't be applied to certain items. A tip: Sign up for their emails to get the coupons, and advance notice of sales."
"1","My husband and I love ice cream, who doesn't? And Cold Stone is our go-to place. It's conveniently placed right next to Chipotle and Jimmy John's. \n\nThe ice cream is great, as usual. Lots of goodies within the ice cream.\n\nOur biggest problem was the customer service. The last time we went it took SO LONG for them to ask what we wanted. There was only one person in front of us in line. \n\nThe place was also dirty as can be. There was stuff all over the floor and we couldn't find one clean table to sit at. It was disgusting. We almost decided to go sit in the car in the parking lot and enjoy it! \n\nNot the best Cold Stone I've ever been to. It's a shame - we love their ice cream."
"1","Due to my rating, I feel I must start off on a positive note. The employees here are stellar! They are very friendly and appreciate the fact that you have chosen their gym to work out in. I have belonged to two other gyms before and their customer service and friendliness does not compare by a long shot. So I must say, this location has the best employees ever!\n\nNow for the ugly. This gym is completely worn down. The equipment is very old and outdated and a lot of it is either out of service or not working up to par. One morning, I jumped to three different stationary bikes until I found one that operated properly. And a lot of their stationary bikes do not have water bottle holsters, which means I have to power through 15-20 minutes of cardio with my water on the floor next to the machine and not readily available to me when I need a quick refreshment through my burn.\n\nI was a member of this gym two years ago, and was with them for four years (five years total counting when I worked out at the one near Summerlin on W. Sahara) and thought it was ok. But, in comparison to the one I worked out at off of W. Sahara and being a member of LVAC for the past two years, this location has the absolute worse gym equipment I have come across. Sad day.\n\nI have to admit that I am going to test out Club Sport here sometime soon, solely based upon the fact that this location's equipment is just lackluster, outdated and poorly maintained. I hope the manager here and the 24 Hour Fitness brand reads these reviews and does something about this. As mentioned, love the employees and the people that work out here are super nice as well, but as a gym, it just doesn't cut it. At least not for me."
"2","I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. \n\nThe price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.\n\nThe service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."
"1","The reason I am giving Sweet Tomatoes two stars is because of the salads and soups. I would go to one star if it was based on service and the other items they serve alone. The salad bar has a good selection of toppings and dressings. But they should get rid of the premium toppings. The items you get for another $2.50 and are just not worth it. I also do not see why we have to pay extra for drinks. With the cost of a beverage added it brings the cost above that of other buffets in town. Other pretty good buffets. If it weren't for the salad and soups I would not go at all. The soup is always pretty good and I just love the chili. It does not seem to be consistent, but always good.\n\nThis last visit the line we ware in was just stopped. We stood in line for over ten minutes while the other line was processed and seated. People that came in long after my wife and I were seated well before we were. It seems there was a large party at the front of our line and they had them stand there waiting to be seated. When we got to the front of the line we asked to talk to a manager and the lady behind the counter said she was one and how could she help. We explained what had happened and she said she could not do anything about it and we needed to speak to the people doing the seating. Excuse me! A manager has no control over how the staff is working? That does not seem right. Once we were seated we did talk to someone who was a manager and she was very thoughtful. She even gave us coupons for a free visit.\n\nAnother thing I do not understand is there fresh fruit bar. It consisted of whole apples, grapes and oranges. The other items were chocolate pudding, jello, and another pudding I could not identify. Fresh fruit? I don't think so."
"1","4 Stars? Put down the bongs everyone, come back to reality and look at what you're giving 4 Stars to. Sweet Tomatoes is what  happens when a bean counter accountant looks at a Golden Corral or Sizzler type salad bar and says what if we could build a restaurant around just the salad bar with a few non-steak extras thrown in to spiff it up? Imagine the cash we'll rake in. Hello Sysco, I want your cheapest product line....\n\nIf you haven't got my point by now you never will. Seriously, it's freakin cafeteria style food. I don't know about you but I have very bad memories of school cafeteria food. So handing me a tray and sending me down the line to pick out my choices brings not so good flashbacks. In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982. This is a place where I had an OMG WTF was I thinking moment when I tried to be polite to the people I was with and choke it down.\n\nToss in staff that are slow to clean the place up, screaming kids, and ho-hum bakery offerings and I see absolutely no reason to think of turning off Stephanie Street into a tight, usually packed parking lot to come here again. 4 Stars? Maybe if someone slipped me special brownies and I had the worst case of the munchies ever. Otherwise it's not only no but hell no. I love salad but every time I think it's a pain in the rear to round up all the ingredients I like for mine I just think of this place. I won't grumble when I go to the store and achieve a sneeze guard free salad experience after coming here. \n\nOh and this is another place where you'll be glad to know there's CVS and Walgreens locations close by for all of your upset stomach needs."
"1","Took my daughter because she earned a free meal coupon for good grades. We have eaten at Joes before numerous times but in California. We were seated outside which was fine but after a few minutes we were invaded by pigeons because the kids sitting behind us were feeding them. The servers said nothing so I ended up getting up and saying something to the other customers. They did stop but it added tension because they were aggravated that I said something even though I was sweet as pie when I said it. The server took forever with every part of the meal. The food was good and hot but if took her forever to bring me my check. While waiting for the check I noticed about 4 giant flying roaches! It is expected to see these in the dessert but usually with regular pest control visits you shouldn't see any! The servers were amused with the activity of the bugs but everyone that was sitting outside was not."
"1","Ah, yes. Whenever I start wondering what it is I don't like about chain restaurants, I can always find a Joe's or other current-or-former Landry's restaurant to remind me why. \n\nBland, tasteless, overpriced, swill."
"1","I went here because of a massive craving for shellfish and it is not far from my house. I was sadly disappointed in almost every component of this experience.\n\nService: Honestly some of the worst service I've ever had. After ordering a cocktail, I was very disappointed when after 20 minutes my server returned to my table, noticed I didn't have my drink yet and said \""No one brought your drink?\"" It is a huge pet peeve when servers do not take responsibility for their tables and it seemed this is what he was doing. My drink ended up coming, but a few minutes after my food. Two other factors played into this horrible service experience. My table was about three tables away from the computer the servers used to ring up orders, and I heard one of the servers very loudly talk about how he was \""screwed out of a tip\"" by a table. Very unprofessional. Finally, the manager of the restaurant did not really seem to care about his restaurant. He stood near the bar socializing with a young woman the entire time I was there, not once did he leave to check on tables or do any work. The only reason I even knew he was the manager was because the servers kept coming up to him with questions.\n\nFood: My food was served cold. Despite being in a steam pot...and it was all incredibly over-cooked. It was like they had steamed my shellfish and then let it sit in the steamer for hours before it was given to me. Very disappointed."
"1","I did provide pictures. After waiting 40 minutes for my dish to arrive to the table it's cold. I just must ask why did I wait so long for cold food. Got to believe no one is in here. I swear its just the husband and I. \nI'm just sitting here waiting for my food to be remade. And watching my husband eat his lunch. I can't believe all this time I've waited for food and it's cold. :( Then to top it all they just keep on forgetting to add things to my dish. Really how did you forget the ice cream? They have a I don't care attitude. So let me get one of those. no more eating at Friday's for me."
"2","Call me a criminal, but I don't like Vegas.  The only reason why I travel there several times a year is because my sister and her family live there.  And the Pinball Hall of Fame is in Vegas.  I usually stay at Boulder Station now because it's close to my sister's house.  And they have bingo every odd hour.\n\nIt's a quiet hotel/casino.  Definitely more for the locals and the Laughlin crowd.  But that's fine by me.  I don't particularly care for the insanity of the Strip.  When I'm not in LA, I like to get away from traffic and people!  \n\nIt's affordable too.  \n\nThe rooms are comfortable, they offer room service, and there is security at the entrance to the hotel tower at night so no local crazies have access to kill you in your sleep."
"1","I stayed here Labor Day weekend 2013 and had so many problems from  being given a room that was occupied , locked out of my room, no maid service, double charged on two credit cards and told that I had two rooms reserved instead of one. They offered me a free upgrade which I decided to take for the same weekend this year, Just four days before I am to leave I just got a call rescinding the same offer that they offered and set up. \n\nI was offered food and beverage comps that do me no good unless I cancel other reservations. They also offered to pick me up at the airport and that does nothing for me as a friend I am meeting is picking me up. I don't think a hotel could do any worse than last year but they topped it by ruining my vacation two years in a row. \n\nMy past stays had been good but they wiped out years of good stays with these two and I think it is time for me to stay where my business is appreciated. I would never recommend staying here to anyone for fear they might get the same treatment."
"1","This Casino is more for the grizzled Veteran than the casual gambler.  Lots of smoke and not the greatest floor layout.  It's also very hard to get in and out of from boulder highway.\n\nSlots:  They have a mix of old and new slots, but mostly old.  I've had some good bonus games here on the classics.\n\nFood:  They have a Mexican restaurant here that my gf can not get enough of... but I not crazy about.  She enjoys their quesadilla.  They also have a burger king, pizza and buffet.\n\nMovies:  The movie theater is very small and dated.  Not a good place to catch a flick.\n\nBingo:  The room is small and full of smoke.  The bar doesn't carry much variety.  The tables have these big dividers that I didn't care for.\n\nTable games:  Not the biggest selection of tables.  I don't remember seeing a roulette wheel."
"1","It was time for an oil change, and I've received coupons advertising Purrfect Auto Service in the past, with an unbelievable price of $9.95.  On this date, I didn't have a coupon, because I've driven past the business in the past, and they advertise the $9.95 price on two sides of their business building.  \n\nI walked into the store, and asked for the $9.95 oil change.  The first thing that the cashier said was that I had to have a coupon for that deal.  I briefly pointed out that the price is ADVERTISED on their building in two places, but it was to no avail.  I must have looked confused and frustrated, because the cashier asked, \""What kind of car do you drive?\"" I told him \""Saturn Ion\"", and was told \""Oh even with the coupon, we wouldn't do that price for that car.\""  I guess this was supposed to make me feel better.  It didn't. Then, I boldly went to the question that hardly mattered at this point, because I wasn't going to reward these guys for deceptive advertising: \""What does an oil change cost for my car?\""  He said \""$29.95\"".  I muttered/stuttered, and headed for the door.\n\nI have no idea what kind of car qualifies for the $9.95 oil change. If you have the time, stop by and find out.  Bring $29.95 plus tax if you actually expect your oil changed."
"1","Heaven...or 7-11....Hahahaha! Ok,  I thought that was pretty funny....cause it is the latter of the two. So, this is just your average, dirty, everything is about to expire, run in the wall 7-11. \n\nI know what your thinking....\""But Tanya - you checked in here\"" Guilty as charged. Sometimes a girl needs a twinkie and a coke to get her back on her feet. DON'T judge!\n\nWould I go out of my way to go back - no. Was I glad I stopped - yes.\n\n7 reasons to go, 11 reasons not too :)"
"1","TERRIBLE place!!!!! First of all we have been going to the this place for over 13 years and they were ok for my dogs shots but if your dog gets sick WORST idea to take here!!!! The dr could careless he doesn't even ask you any questions about your pet. We went there because one of my dogs had diarrhea for 2weeks  the dr said don't worry about it as long as he is still eating and drinking he wil be fine.  No testing of any kind that day. So 2 more weeks go by and my poor dog is still sick and he started to throw up a little bit we take him back yo this terrible place all they say is let's take blood work and they gave him antibiotics for ten days. 3 days go by and the dr doesn't even call us bak to let us know about the results we had to call. The dr doesn't even go over blood work with us the receptionist just tell us dr said that to keep taking the antibiotics to make sure it's not a bacteria infection but that we would need more blood work because his liver might be damaged or failing. Like really if my dogs liver is failing you couldn't call us to get us is ASAP for more lab work!! So my poor dog has had diarrhea for 2 months now and has lost 11 pounds! So we go to get a 2nd opinion because we feel Luke this is not right. We request our records and blood work to be faxed to the vet ( green valley animal hospital ) and n.lv makes it in possible for us to get these records that we have paid for rightfully ours they didn't want to send them they say they did but we never received them. We call back and Jessica the receptionist tell us that Dr. Is telling her that they will no longer fax anything for us and then said the dr. Is telling her to hang up on us. Really professional!!! Bottom line is best decision we have made. If you love your pets DO NOT take your dogs here!"
"1","Let me preface this with I am from San Antonio, TX and have been DESPERATE to find decent Mexican food in Las Vegas. I saw the great reviews of this place on Yelp and also the parking lot seemed to be pretty busy (a good sign) so we stopped in. \nWe were given chips and salsa to start off with along with a bowl of beans (very very bland). I am a big fan of homemade chips since it's easy and makes all the difference...these were from a bag. \nThere were 5 of us so we had a pretty good run of the menu to see if this place was legit. We are also from all different parts of the country so this place was given a fair shot. We ALL thought our food was pretty bad and the service was horrible as well. I had a chicken chimichanga which I didn't eat because it came as beef. When I asked to skip the salsa on top and have them put cheese she said they had to charge me an extra $1...seriously?! Beans and rice had ZERO flavor and even my 4 year old said he didn't like his food. Also I asked for tortillas that NEVER came...we asked three people for the check before finally being able to pay for horrible food...I will not go back which is a shame because I wanted this place to live up to their hype."
"1","well i used to enjoy the food but every time my wife and i visit this restaurant it gets worse and worse and i dont want to risk how bad the next visit will be....well the main problem i had was a mexican restaurant put canned jalapenos on the nachos and had ballpark cheese......gross"
"2","Loved this place! Found this place through yelp! Service was great, super clean and friendly. Not to mention, their food was Delicious! We ordered the steak cilantro, chile verde quesadilla and chicken burrito (enchilada style). Portion sizes are huge so try not to get full on the chips salsa and beans. :)"
"2","We were in Vegas for the week for my daughter's wedding and wanted to try someplace different...not a chain, not on the strip, but great none the less....we found it in Viva Zapatas!\n\nWe went on a Monday night, and made reservations since there were going to be about 10 of us.\nWe only had to wait about 10 min. after we got there, no problems at all.\nIt isn't very big, but it's decorated wonderfully and it doesn't feel crowded at all, just right.\nOne thing I loved is that the entire time we were there there was a 1 man mariachi playing a guitar and singing live. I don't know if he is there all the time or not, but I loved it...just added to the ambiance.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido con Chorizo in addition to the complimentary chips, salsa, and frijoles. Oh my goodness! It was the best, cheesiest, sausage-y goodness ever!\n\nOur table also ordered a pitcher of Cadillac Margs...the \""pitcher\"" was more of a carafe, but the margs were delish!\n\nWith 10 of us there were a variety of entrees ordered and everyone loved theirs. Mine was a cheese enchilada and chili relleno, both were delicious.\n\nFlan for dessert topped off the evening perfectly. \n\nWhen I'm in Vegas again I will definitely go back!"
"2","In particular for not being in a great area this place is friggin sweet!  Salsa dynamite. Shrimp was excellent. Great Guac. Solid all around."
"2","Still the best!! Delicious food, bomb drinks, great service. What else can u ask for. Must try!!"
"2","The beans.... Oh the beans! And they're complimentary. Along with the Fideo soup. Oh, man! I would eat just that, it makes me so nostalgic for meals from my past.  With that said, everything we have tried has been very good. We have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The parking lot is a hot mess and the seating area is small but once you sit down and they bring the complimentary beans, salsa, chips and soup I am already so happy that I end up ordering a small meal to share with someone! So if you want to get off the strip and have a good, more authentic Mexican meal head over to Viva Zapatas!"
"2","This is the best Mexican food on this side of town.  The Pescado Eufimio Zapata has a wine based sauce, with Spanish olives, that is the best I've ever had.  They also have decent priced lunch specials on weekdays."
"1","Line huge. Try other Pilot or travel center"
"1","I've never had any problems with the fuel desk staff. As a truck driver it is a common stop for fuel. The showers have recently been remodeled, the Pizza Hut will give you their number so that you can call ahead and order a fresh pizza. However as a truck driver it is a pain to get to if your south bound. The fuel pumps are always packed so its always a wait to get fuel. I give this a two star rating because of the wait for fuel and hard on and off."
"1","Played black jack.  I put $20 near betting spots, Double Deck, for dealer to change. He dealt right past my money.  I put the money down while he shuffling.\nLeft that table and went to a BJ shoe game.  Deal never smiled or said a word.  Would never play BJ here again.  Got the feeling my business was not, in the least, appreciated.\nWanted to play poker, but it doesn't open till 6pm"
"2","I was chillin with the homies a couple weeks ago and we stopped by this hole in the wall to get some Korean food. You would not expect this place to have Korean food if you just drove by the place. I only found out about this place cause my homie is a regular.\n\nI ordered the Bi Bim Bop, which is beef, rice, veggies and a fried egg. We wanted to dine-in but we got there 10 minutes before they were closing. We decided to get old school and picked up some cold ones and ate our food at the park. There was a lot of food and it tasted good for a hole in the wall.\n\nI will come back to try their Kimchi Soup."
"1","I tried to give denny's another chance in another part of town, but it still SUCKS. there were a minimum amount of customers and the service was still lousy. the food is so expensive for the quality or lack thereof. Denny's you will never get another dime from me no matter how hungry I am. for that 2.99 you charged for OJ, lemonade and coffee each....well that's just a big fat rip."
"1","The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said \""oh wait I'll cook your food right now\"" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less."
"2","this place really rocks!...the food is delish...we dont mind the drive from the strip to come and enjoy some good food, drinks, and live musicos!!! the tacos al gobernador are yummy and the pulpitos are a must try! dont leave vegas without stopping by!"
"1","My husband and I went here on a Saturday night at about 9:30pm. It was not very busy but it was so loud, it was ridiculous. There were two \""bands\"" playing. One band had a tuba player and it was so loud that it sounded like there was an elephant in the room. I ordered a Diet Coke to start and I wouldn't have mind paying $2.50 for it, except for it came in a can. I think $2.50 for a can of Diet Coke (so no free refills) is way too expensive. In fact, almost everything on the menu was very expensive (most entrees are between $17 and $25), considering that the restaurant itself is very informal (almost like a diner), I thought that the prices were way too high. Between the high prices and the loud tuba, we didn't even stay long enough to order food. \nUnless you like very loud tuba music and like paying very high prices for seafood (given the atmosphere), I wouldn't go here."
"2","Great place to go eat and listen to music. Ive been here a couple of times and the food and service was awesome ,recently came to watch the world cup game and had a blast i definitely recommend this place whether to eat watch a game or just spend time with family ."
"1","I''ve attended colleges in KS, TX, and since relocating to NV, transfered again to CSN.  BAD decision.  They don't have enough classes for the number of students they have.  Trying to get anything through admissions or financial aid is a JOKE.  They tell you they need something one at a time, turn that in, and all of the sudden they need something else(JUST GIVE ME A LIST, AND YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL AT ONCE!)  Semester already started and my financial aid still hasn't been reviewed.  I get a different time frame from each person I talk to, 6-8 weeks, or 8-12 weeks..  well it's been 12 and I have nothing but a hold not to drop my classes.  Even University of Texas with crazy amounts of students was able to get it done by the week school started.  \nMy husband checked with the VA office to see if he needed to do anything when he changed his degree.. the guy gave him a piece of paper to sign and said \""that's it\""  school started a week ago, and we received a letter today saying they don't have his transcripts, that we sent 3 months ago, and he called to find out that he DID need to have a sheet signed by a counselor, but the uninformed guy had told us otherwise.  Thanks for screwing up our housing money buddy!!  They lost my transcripts as well, which when I asked them how they traced them they said by social security number (GOOD!  Cause I changed my name when I got married)  They didn't.. they put them in storage and I had to call and talk to probably 10 different people and tell them BOTH names for them to all look for my current name.  It's just as bad trying to figure out who does what.. I got sent all over campus and standing in lines for an hour and a half, by their employees who didn't know who I needed to show my unofficial transcripts to to open a class for me.\nThe bookstore has the classes listed for the wrong books, or that don't even need books, needless to say I waited an hour and a half in line to return books, and everybody else had the same problem.  This school is one disorganized mess, I think after this (one and only) semester at CSN I may do distance education from a better school with more degree choices.  \nALSO, one of the most frustrating things.. I have taken online classes from every school i've been to, and had no problem.  There is a \""lockdown\"" program for testing that won't even run on my 4 mo old laptop because my desktop manager has no option for closing (basically I can not have a clock, the date, updates running)  I had to dig my husbands old computer out of a box just to take a test, and it froze on me 2 minutes in, yet the clock didn't stop running.  \nI don't know who is in charge at this school, as every person I have dealt with other than cashiers is a student, but they need to get their stuff together.  \n\nTHIS SCHOOL IS A JOKE!"
"1","the positive reviews must have been written by people with the munchies. The tamale was decent but the donuts were heavy and the girl at the counter had no clue of what she was selling. They are currently looking for someone who can make donuts. Sign at the door said experience is not necessary."
"1","This place was pretty good someone took me here a long time ago and I could never remember the name and I just found it. The neighborhood is not so nice But I guess don't let that run you away Have to try new things!!"
"1","The hotel rooms might not be the most modern ones but they're fair for the price you pay. The room has been (mostly) clean and during our stay the location was very quit (which we were looking for). However, the fact that we had to pay an extra fee of $ 13 per day which has not been mentioned before is an unacceptable business practice not to mention the fact of price distortion."
"1","PLEASE dont waste your time or money going here! We got 2 nights king room for our 1 year anniversary (before going to a gifted timeshare) and im so glad I ddnt stay longer than 2 nights. 1st off our tub was DIRTY im talkin someones booger, hair and lotion on the wall of the freaking shower. The bed looked worn.   ( u shaped) and had a possible adjoining room so we heard our neighbors cussing out their kids and being loud in the am. Didnt mind all the black people, didnt feel \""unsafe\"" but the hallway smelt like weed strongly. And no ac in halls. Even for a good deal of less than $40 for both nights (groupon) I wouldnt go again. Pool is pitiful thats y they dont even mention they have one. Not kidding. Hot tub size pretty much. Didnt use it. Just overall not a great experience at all. Bowling alley sucks. Movie theatre is average. Bleh. Thats about it. Will NEVER EVER come again. \n\n They also sent me an email saying I had a reservation for the day I checked out,  to come check back in for 1 night so I had to call once I had already left. Waited on phone 10 minutes only to be told they had no record of a reservation and that my card wouldnt be charged again. Bars are closed or stink...seriously"
"2","My friend and I took her car here for an oil change while my car was being repaired elsewhere.\n\nI was pleased with our experience here.  We were welcomed in right away into a comfortable lobby where water and coffee was waiting.  While they were busy they were still able to provide timely service.  When it was discovered that some additional work was needed on my friend's car she was seen right away, given pricing and the job was done quickly.\n\nI am sure she will take her car her again and I would recommend that the good people of Las Vegas take their business here too."
"2","Always fresh and hot. Service is good . This is our favorite pizza location. What's not to love???"
"2","What can be said about Caps' Bobby? Everything, it's my favorite all time sandwich! It's the best. This location has very friendly people and it's always clean and nice. We always stop by here on our way out of town and they have no problem with making my wife her special sandwich."
"1","27 lanes to check out but only 3 - 4 at any given time, manned by people who have poor attitudes. I've been here 8 times in two weeks out of necessity because I just moved here and my household goods haven't arrived yet. Every time I go to check out, the cashiers just give a grunt to acknowledge you and the ones working the floor don't even stop when you ask a question."
"1","I dont think it deserves a star waiting on line for a hour every time I go here I get depressed. Customer service is so bad. They dont even help me when I ask for help only 2 registers open at 10pm here in vegas. The worst walmart ever. I rather travel 15 miles to go to a different walmart.  Not to this one any more."
"1","Within walking distance from my family's place - I find myself at this corner convenience store whenever I want something quick and easy. \n\nI have to admit, it's an interesting mix of people that make up both the clientele and the staff there. I hope that's a nice enough way of saying that there may be some elements that may entice you to skip over this place and go elsewhere. I've never been physically involved in altercations here however I have seen a few in my time. \n\nI can say that the pumps offer Shell gas and that the pumps are usually in working order."
"2","This place is excellent. Jason was extremely helpful and polite on the phone. I only spent about thirty minutes there for them to check my tire. I was anticipating having to purchase a new tire but I paid nothing. They fixed the leak and I was good to go. By interacting with and seeing the staff, they seem to genuinely care about efficiency and customer service."
"2","Great prices, friendly staff. I feel very comfortable shopping here."
"1","Normally I wouldn't bother with a fast food joint, but every time I come here my orders are consistently messed up. No matter what day, what time of day or how simple my order is something is always wrong. Today my iced coffee didn't have ice in it. Another time I had to remind them for my change. Always a fail."
"2","There's nothing like a fresh, hot Krispy Kreme doughnut.  Except, however, when you're going to use them to make bread pudding.  Then they go from the exceptional to the sublime."
"1","I've been getting my haircut for years with Rosa and I have brought family and friends and everybody loved her. We all use to go together to get our haircuts, Rosa made it fun at Great Clips.I CALLED IN THE OTHER DAY AND SHE IS NO LONGER THERE. I will have to inform my family and friends the bad news. We will need to find us another Rosa who will take care of us. I'm no longer going to GREAT CLIPS."
"1","Don't order from Domino's Pizza in North Las Vegas. They charged my credit card, then messed up the order. They said I would not get a refund on my credit card for three business days. Just a few seconds of their mistake and suddenly I am responsible for the charges for three business days. This is a management problem. I hope someone in Domino's corporate manager reads this. This is poor customer service. I will never again order from any Domino's Pizza as a result of what happened tonight as I wait for three days for my refund."
"1","HALF STAR!!! I had gotten a delivery, once it arrived I was shocked to see a flat \""pan pizza\"" instead of handmade pan pizza! It's my favorite pizza to order on the count of I love the bread, but in this case I got gooey uncooked mess. When I called back to tell them what was wrong Maritza told me that it could be flat as long as it was in a pan...huh? I told her I order here and normally get thick bread with air pockets she said she made my order and she can send another but it's going to be just the same..I refuse. Terrible customer service as well as terrible pizza quality!!!"
"1","I ordered the food for the first time here and decided to order delivery the lady I called asked me to hold and put the phone down I listened to her take about 15 orders while I waited 10 minutes for her to return to the call. I decided to call back and it has now been 1 hour and 15 minutes later I still had not received my food. I called to see what was wrong and told them it had been going on two hours I've been trying to eat and they need to do something. He had no sympathy for me and told me they got the address wrong ect. Horrible customer service and I'm still paying for this. Bad service wouldn't recommend delivery for anyone. Very poorly run."
"1","The WORST nail salon experience since moving to Henderson in October! Here's why:\n\nMy young daughter and I came in as walk-ins about 6:30pm and were promptly told that they close up at 7pm. When I asked if they would have time for two full mani/pedis, they said YES. We picked out polish and were seen fairly quickly.\n\nAnyone who has had their nails done anywhere is used to the fact that the salon workers will occasionally speak their native language (Vietnamese here). What I did not like about this place right off the bat was that the salon workers carried on loud, lengthy conversations in Vietnamese without any regard for their clients. It was obvious that they were talking a lot of shit about their clients in the salon. It was an uncomfortable, unpleasant experience. I was raised bilingual, and was always taught that speaking a foreign language in front of people who can not understand it was RUDE. Plain & simple. \n\nMy young daughter picked out some trendy polish for her nails & toes. She was on the verge of tears when she left the salon because the nail tech was rough with her and told her that she didn't like her color choices and that they were ugly. WTF?! Who tells a kid that??? Last time I checked, the client picks whatever they like. Way to treat a future client! I was really upset that my daughter was treated this way. \n\nMy manicure tech was rough and caused two of my fingers to bleed. My gel french manicure was ok, but it had a couple noticeable mistakes in the tip polish. Attributed to pure laziness and rushing to close up and go home. My pedicure was the only thing that looked decent, however, rather than being allowed drying time inside the salon, we were rushed to pay and rushed out. My toes were not dry when I left the salon. Honestly, NOT worth the money I paid.\n\nI will not be back to this salon and I will be letting all of my friends, family and co-workers know why. Pure shit. I will be making the drive to North Vegas to my favorite salon. It's worth it and I should have never left for something closer."
"1","We frequent McDonalds quite often with a little 5 year old.  I didn't notice this location had the f-t-f service so I am sitting waiting for someone to say \""May I take Your Order?\"" - just a friendly honk from behind me to nudge me away.  The gal at the 1st window was very nice so that is for the one star rating I gave this location.  I get to the window and the gal doesn't even greet me and gives me the wrong item.  I ordered a milkshake WITHOUT whipcream.  The order was correct but she made it incorrectly.  For some reason I throw up by having this so I see her through the window off to the side taking off the whip cream.  She comes back to the window and I told her that I saw what she did and that I can't have it or I will end up across the street in ER.  She still doesn't say anything and goes to make another milkshake and gives me the milkshake without saying sorry or thank you for coming to McDonalds.  Aghhhh.  My big pet-peeve with ALL the McDonalds they NEVER give nor offer ketchup when you get fries and once again this happened.  If you are going to offer friendly face to face service please live up to that.  I hated this location and the grumpy girl - get a new job girl or a new attitude.  With so many people out of work McDonalds could have hired a friendly person.  Geeeeeez"
"1","It's McDonalds that should say a lot. I really don't like the way their drive thru works... Why cant I just order at the board? It would be so much easier if you had the menu in front of you to double check what the guy at the window is saying... It's not like they were going to getting right anyway. I do give McD's credit for having great ice cream! I don't know why but I have always loved their cones... It's really the only edible thing there."
"2","Gaetano's is one of the nicest restaurants that I have been to in Las Vegas so far! We went there to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed! I had their Chicken Picatta and asked for a few alterations such as sauce on the side, less butter etc. and everything I asked for they gladly accommodated! Their menu is very extensive and authentic Italian cuisine. Our water glasses were never empty and the service was exquisite! Lovely table cloths on every table which made for a very nice ambience! It's no wonder that they won Best of Las Vegas 6 or 7 times!"
"1","Over priced and overrated. While I admit the butternut squash ravioli was enjoyable, the calamari was flavorless rubber and the tiramisu was lackluster at best. Randall and Andrew are wonderful servers, but I found Gaetano himself to be incredibly off-putting. I've also heard tell that he has a tendency to treat his employees with disrespect, and as a former service industry employee myself, I take serious issue with that. Overall, not an establishment I care to patronize again."
"1","I am adding my comments to tag with JANET N'S comment on 12/21/14, I was  the person who brought the Groupon. Had the Waiter taken our coupons when we offered them to him at the beginning of service, we all could have avoided the embarrassment and humiliation we endured.  The so called Mrs. Manager /Hostess was rude, and both Mgr. and Waiter continued to act inappropriately by returning to our table to voice their opinions to us. In addition, the Waiter placed an 18% service charge (mind you we are only a party of 4) on our check, assuming that he deserved it. Two more negatives: 1). The 7 up we ordered, was never replaced as the BAR ran out of 7 up-it was 5 pm when the restaurant opened that they ran out of soda?  2). The restaurant did not serve fresh grated Parmesan cheese. That was shocking considering the price point and the theme of the restaurant indicating Italian food served.  Not a great Christmas Dinner experience!"
"1","I don't know what is squeakier in these theaters... The hips of the older crowd that filled 95% of the seats, or the chairs EVERY time someone shifted their weight. The chairs were just ridiculous. The olds, just meant more talking during the movie.\n\n Also the arm rests are awful! They are concave and hardly padded at all, in between hard plastic edges!!! So it feels like you are resting your arm on bones.\n\nAnd a minor complaint, the bathrooms don't have a paper towel option to dry your hands, only blowers that blow cold, not warm, air. After a 2 hr movie, in a cold theater, that is not pleasant at all!"
"1","I like the location of this theater since we ate dinner at The District and stayed at Green Valley Station.  We saw the movie Little Focker and I do have to say that the seats were very comfortable and the inside of the theater was very clean. The sound and picture was excellent.  The Women's bathroom was filthy.  I went into 5 different stalls until I found a clean one to use.  Also, two of the workers were wearing the appropriate shirt and color pants but they had the pants hanging low that there butt cracks would be showing if their shirt was not long enough.  Not appropriate and if I was their manager I would be sending them home.  I don't personally like that style of clothing but I feel if you dress like that that is fine but not to work.  So, this leads me to believe that there is lack of management there."
"1","The first thing I has to say about this place is that it is NOT Mexican. They need to change the name of this place or something because this is not Mexican at ALL. \nI rally hate this place and about every single person in my Mexican family hated it. \nEvery single one of them agree that it is not Mexican at all. \nTaco Bell would be more Mexican than this. I'm embarrassed of this place. \nI've eaten here 3 times and I hated everything. My parents hate it too and we couldn't even finish our meal. \nI have no idea how anyone could eat here. \nI eat almost anywhere and I hate making bad reviews but this place is just that bad.\nIf people like it then that's fine and all but I can't stand that it's called Mexican."
"2","My first visit to Yoga Sanctuary East Side location was an expectation of a better studio than the West side. I came for Shawn's 2nd series of Ashstanga practice on a Saturday. The class was amazing! \n\nBack to the studio, a friend mentioned east side studio is a lot better than west side.  It is located inside a 2 story building/shopping center. I had to take the elevators or stairs to the studio. As I waited in the lobby for the class to start, it felt that I was more in an office environment rather than in a studio so I was disappointed.  Once I walked into the room where the class is held, it was definitely better! 2 huge windows and you can see the vigorous and mountainous desert oasis. It actually was nicer and I did appreciate a wonderful view during my ashtanga practice."
"2","Great food! Great service! awesome portions! dream about their food after only being there once. Can not wait to return! Love the New York feel but the food comes out like it was made only for you!!!!"
"1","Pasta: over-cooked Lasagna, drenched in Cheese, no Bechamel.\nPizza: dough and sauce okay, way too much cheese, boring\n\nService: unattentive old man. \nAtmosphere: Vinyl tablecloth, tacky deco, could be in the Bronx\n\nNo reason to ever go back."
"2","Buon gusto is the bomb.  Pizza is really good."
"1","Waited over 30 minutes for our food. Was it worth it? Nope. Food didn't have any taste I had to season myself.  I don't think I wanna come back again. Poor server was really nice. But What's up with the kitchen? What a shame."
"1","We ate here today for lunch and service was horrible! We were seated promptly and it took almost five minutes for our server to come over and greet us. She took our order since we had long enough to look over the menu in her absence.  Before our food came, she informed us it would only be a few more minutes which was nice. Our food came and our waitress came right after and asked us if everything looked ok. That was the last time we saw her until it was time for the check. We came here with a kids eat free coupon and our check was wrong so she had to go fix it. She came back and apologized and told us it was so busy because of the coupon. That's funny because there were several open tables near us. I don't blame the waitress though, is one falls on management and not having enough staff to accommodate more people during busy times or when a coupon is put out. I don't understand why it is so hard to get decent service in restaurants. We are not high maintenance at all, but expect our drink glasses to never go empty, is that too much to ask? I shouldn't have to flag down a hostess or another server to refill my drink or ask for more napkins."
"1","Stale cone, asked for chocolate sprinkles, and got rainbow."
"2","Okay soo i decided to choose this supercuts to get my haircut at because the last time i got a haircut they did a great job. This time i was a little nervous because i made the decision to cut off all of my hair. (meaning pixie cut) And i didnt have the money to go to a fancy salon when i knew that supercuts would do an equally great job if not better than a salon that would cost 30 just for a haircut. Anyways i went as soon as they opened and was sat in a chair immediately!! Emily, who is the manager i believe cut my hair. And she did such an amazing job. I showed her pictures and described exactly what i wanted and she did just that. I am more than happy with my experience. I definitely recommend getting your haircut here!"
"1","My nails chipped the next day. Gel was cracking. In after she did my nails they were very score but I think it's because she didn't clear the critic from under the nail. It was not busy so I don't know why she did a half job on me. Will never go back... Wait the pedicure was good but who wants to go to two different places to get their feet and nails done"
"2","I love this place.  It's unique.  It's not New York thin with little cheese and cut in wedges.  \n\nGreat sauce, great crust, great sausage, lots of cheese, cut in little squares.  Awesome.\n\nOrder with extra sauce.  Good stuff.  You can find cheaper pizza but not much better around here.  Yum."
"1","Went here for drinks on a Saturday night and the place was not extremely busy but for some reason it was like pulling teeth to have my beer filled.  Maybe the bartenders were having an off night but after 5 minutes of the bartenders walking by i had to flag them down for a cocktail.  \n\nWe ordered 12 of the boneless wings that came out extremely quickly...maybe 2 quickly.  The chicken totaly dry, the sauce didn't even seem present.  Perhaps said chicken had been from a previous order or cooked before ordered. \n\nIf you're just looking for a place to watch a game and do not care about service, food, and drinks this would be a great choice as they did have many games on."
"2","It not often drive too this side of town but every year come Match Madness tradition meet some friends we drink and watch games all day. IF UNLV is in the tournament this is THE PLACE too be! It amazes me the past two years many Rebel fans come out support not just watch but vocal too. Lots of flat screens all around the bar in different sizes so watch any game on great spot. \n\nThe bar area not that big space so if its packed like aka Rebels game go early. The dining area is decent size area mostly table not many booths. The parking lot not problem in shopping mall so plenty too go around. \n\nThe food always been fan of their food especially the boneless wings and variety of sauces you can choose from my favorite is the mango sauce. Selection of draft beers is always good. It not no yard house but over 20 or more beers too choose from on tap. Something there you can enjoy."
"1","I was at the bar playing max bets and got my bill and was charged full price for my drinks?  Nothing comped.  Left as an unhappy customer.You would think blowing a couple hundred buck at video poker would at least comp me a few drinks.  Nope."
"1","This place is a nightmare. YOU ARE SERVING CHICKEN WINGS, NOT GOLD NUGGETS. The price is outrageous. 2 people, no alcohol, dinner menu. With tip- $60. What are you people thinking???? I hear you can get some good deals on the lunch menu. Will not be finding out. Need to take a second mortgage to eat here. Not worth the expense. Go anywhere else."
"1","I frequent this location often-We usually order online or phone it in and get food to go- and usually pay with a credit/debit card. \nBE AWARE ----my husband gave a five dollar tip (granted, he should have given more, but in his defense it wasn't a big order and it was to-go) and his card was charged with a 40 dollar tip. \nOnly because I was looking over my account regarding another issue did I question the large purchase at BWW. I called and spoke to a manager, and was told it would be looked into. The extra 35 dollars was refunded several days later, but I never received a call back, or any apology of any sort. \nThat is extremely shady- and stealing! To not even get at least an apology is poor business practice."
"2","I live next to a different Smith's so when I walked into this one and saw how neat and clean they keep it, I was jealous! Freshly baked bread, deli counter, friendly employees and even hot soup that you can eat in the store! Wish I lived closer to it :("
"2","This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Nevada.  The fish is always the freshest.  The food is just top of the line.  The service is always very good as well.  I remember reading that Osaka in Henderson was on a list of the 50 best sushi restaurants in the world...and the other 49 were in Japan, so that kind of says something right there.  I highly recommend this location.  I was not as crazy about the other locations as they didn't have the same awesome quality of fish and pleasant atmosphere."
"1","We are regulars here. On may 2. 2014  our usual party of five showed up for my sons birthday. Now we love eating here but as we were seated in the back at the teppan table a large cockroach crawled out from the side of the grill and headed toward my daughter....the manager just smiled said he would kill it and moved us to the next table! No offers of any kind followed! This was disgusting and will surely end our  twice monthly dinners there-gross!!!"
"2","4 stars b/c I wish they were AYCE\n\nOsaka's is one of the original sushi joints in Las Vegas. Their rolls are very delicious but they do get costly b/c they don't offer all you can eat. When my bf and I go here our bill is usually $100+. Osaka's is good if you don't want to be gluttonous."
"1","Not the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas. \nThe one waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there. It's work, we know but that's just bad customer service. \nAlso don't get the  shumai(spchek). Tasted like it was the frozen kind. My gf spit it out and wrapped it up in a tissue, then put the last two pieces in another tissue and slipped it into my pocket so we didn't have to eat it. Threw it away right after we left.\nQuick tip: don't get all the nigiri or rollsin one order, they will put them all together and if you get any with sauces such as the garlic sauce or teriyaki sauce, they will mix into the other rolls. Idk about some but I like my nigiri without a sauce unless I plan on dipping it into some soy sauce. \nIt gets two stars cause the chefs called the waitress to help us. Or else it would've gotten one."
"1","This place is not good sushi and the prices don't reflect the service.  I went with 2 friends and the waitress made a huge deal about my friend returning her cucumber salad that looked a few days old.  Will not be going back.  Smith's on Valle Verde makes better rolls!"
"1","This place is very overrated. The hamburgers and sides are way overpriced. Sure,  the fried egg option is awesome but the burgers do not taste that great. I went to lunch here with a friend and between the two of us it was $28+ dollars. Way too much money for a fast food  hamburger stand. For that price, I could eat at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. The service here sucks too, I was gambling around 4AM and went up to the counter. The guy cooking did not even acknowledge me.  So I just left. There are way better hamburger places than this dump!\n\nLast great hamburger stand my A$$!!!!!!!!!!! --Very disappointed"
"1","This burger joint operates in the Green Valley Ranch Casino and is a Fatburger franchise.  Now Fatburger is renowned in California for their juicy delicious burgers.  However their reputation does NOT translate to the Green Valley Ranch Casino location.  I went there about a month ago and asked for a medium large fatburger, hold the relish and mayo.  The mayo and relish were held however the burger came as a salty grossly overcooked piece of meat, more tasteless than the inexpensive major burger chains and cost $11.45.  I was shocked.  I recently returned and placed the same order for a large fatburger medium rare.  The waitress said fine.  Again to my surprise I received an overcooked burger loaded with salt. A piece of shoe leather would have been more appetizing!!  Again I paid $11.45.  Two times is enough for me.  This place is the WORST and does not come close to living up to the Fatburger standards. This franchise needs to be closed. You would do better and cheaper eating at any other burger joint in Las Vegas and there are many."
"1","Nothing outstanding here. Portions are a good size. Lots of variety to choice from. Staff doesn't seem to leave behind the counter. There's a small salsa bar but nothing to fuss about. I've had the fish tacos which were a little bland. Same for the chicken burritos, not much flavor. Not sure why I expected this place to be good, bigger menu than del taco but not much on taste. If you're hungry and need a quick bite I guess it'll do."
"1","If I could give this place no stars, I would. Worst manicure I've ever had. They upcharged my 13 year old sister kid sister without first alerting one of us the change in pricing. Total rip off, rude service, not even worth going back to get my nails fixed."
"1","The facility is beautiful, nice and clean with great massage chairs but the service was terrible. I came in with my cousin. I got a mani and pedi and my cousin got a gel manicure. I was out in the chair and put my feet in water for 40 minutes before they started servicing me. I wish they had at least done me first and then my cousin so that she wouldn't have to wait a whole hour before I finished. They didn't apologize, and did mediocre work on my mani and pedi. They saw how unhappy I was about the wait and told me that the others made an appointment."
"1","Panda Express food is reliable and standardized, and we enjoy it. But this location is in serious need of organization. There was almost no line when I arrived around 4:30pm on a weeknight, but they did not seem to plan ahead to replace items that were sold out. There were no mixed vegetables, so they asked someone to make some (they did not, not at first). Then while I was waiting for the veg, the chow mein sold out and they had to make more. Then while I was waiting for those, the broccoli beef sold out and they called out for more. After those were ready, THEN they started on the veg. They had 3 guys cooking in the back, but they need a plan to continuously replace the items that are popular and almost gone. I waited 20 minutes for my take-out while others just went around me, then when they finally had my items ready I had to remind them what I ordered, as they were about to put in the wrong thing (maybe the server was new and still learning the codes). This is the closest Panda Express to my home, but I'll be going to a different location in the future."
"2","What a great little hidden gem! Jimbo, the bartender, was super sweet and very attentive! I went on a Thursday, but WILL be back on a Wednesday because word around the campfire is there is a GREAT ladies' night deal! I had the Rodeo Burger. DE-LISH! The BBQ sauce was tangy and fresh and the BEER BATTERED FRIES were to DIE for! I am a fan of beer battered anything. Another bonus was the beers on tap. Alaskan amber (my fave) AND Alaskan White. Also Magic Hat!! Which is a little hard to find on the west coast. I highly recommend coming and sitting at the bar on a weeknight when it's nice and quiet. Next time I am trying the fish tacos!"
"2","Food was good and reasonably priced. Service was excellent.  Pasta was a little oily for my taste."
"2","My family and I came here for the first time last night. We were all very pleased with our meals. It was quite fantastic. \n\nWe started off with the bread with herbs, olive oil, and balsamic which was fantastic. The bread was nice and warm. We also ordered the calamari and zucchini fritte. The calamari was way overcooked and we were not satisfied with it at all, I could barely pick it up with my fork because it was so crunchy. The zucchini fritte was very delicious. The garlic aioli that it came with was also very tasty. \n\nI had the Chicken Bryan with garlic mashed potatoes. The chicken had goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, and basil on it. It was so delicious. The goat cheese almost melted in my mouth when I ate it. It was fantastic. However, the chicken was a tiny bit overcooked but the flavors made up for it. The mashed potatoes were also awesome! I also had the peach sangria which was good but it tasted a lot like juice. \n\nMy husband had the chicken trio and he also enjoyed his meal very much. Although, he did say that his chicken was a bit overcooked. My parents both had the veal Marsala and they enjoyed it very much too. I didn't get to taste theirs so I can't really comment on it. \n\nThe service was great too but not the best waiter I've ever had. He was quick and efficient though so it was good. The girl at the front desk was not very friendly though. \n\nOverall, a great place and it's always booming with business. Every time I drive by the parking lot is always packed. The food is great and we were satisfied."
"2","Real Italian it ain't, but Carrabba's it a cut above other Americanized chains like Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill. What sets this place apart from the others is their woodfired grill and more \""exotic\"" ingredients for the palates of regular Joes. My favorite dish on the menu is their Chicken Bryan, a fire-roasted chicken breast (yes, a real breast, not a processed breast 'patty') topped with a lemon butter sauce, sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. \n\nCarrabba's is also really good at accommodating special eating plans. I'm a low carber and they've always been super nice about letting me substitute veggies for pasta (they'll even make the chicken soup WITHOUT noodles in it if you ask). I appreciate the level of customization that they offer. The olive oil on the table is crap, but they do get extra points for bringing out a grater with fresh parmesan cheese to top all of your entrees. \n\nThe prices are a bit high for what you get (plan on spending about $50 on an appetizer, soda and entrees for two -- not including alcohol or dessert, before tip), but at least they serve fresh, quality food.  \n\nThe service at this location has always been good and friendly. The restaurant atmosphere is really drab and sad and is in need of a makeover. It's depressing, actually. VERY dark (not the good, romantic kind of dark, the super dismal and melancholic kind of sad) and VERY dank. Ask for a seat near the open kitchen so you can watch the cooks in action."
"1","Went here last night. Food wasn't great, really what you would expect from a place like this. There was a clothing plastic tag in my salad. They comped my meal. The waiter was a good guy. Great bread, I'll give them that."
"2","Mike was our server he was knowledgeable great personality very attentive the food and his service was awesome.  We will definitely be back and ask for him."
"2","This restaurant is owned by Tommy Rocker's ex-wife, Donna.  The d\u00e9cor is reminiscent of a lodge you might expect to find somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.  Our meal began with a mixed salad lightly dressed with a vinaigrette.  We each ordered the evening's special, fresh halibut roasted in the oven and served with a citrus sauce that was accompanied by fingerling potatoes and a saut\u00e9 of fresh vegetables.  The portion size was about 8 ounces and the fish was moist and delicious.  The only negative, a minor one, was our server was a bit disengaged.  Overall, our meal exceeded expectations."
"1","We went there on Christmas day, we called ahead of time to see if we needed reservations, they said no, unless you want a booth. So we reserved a booth and told them we would be there in half an hour. We arrived and no booth available, she says I see your name here, but its first come first serve, so we waited at the bar, when we were seated we ordered appetizers which were really good, but then didnt get our dinner for over an hour later. People were coming and going and we were still waiting, I complained and was told they had a party in the back room, so they were very busy. When my steak arrived it was burnt and dry, I asked for a container, I figured my dogs would like that. Worse service ever and not the friendliest place."
"1","Tasty food, super friendly and efficient staff, ice cold beer. Why only 2 stars then? Sewer problem, the bar had a very bad odor that the staff tried to mask it with a candle in the restroom and by opening the doors on a cold night.  Not the first time we've experienced this there. Hope it's fixed soon or we may have to find another watering hole- too bad."
"2","A great place to eat. Fresh food and good people behind the bar."
"2","This place is the reason why I started liking sushi... I tried it out a couple months ago and now I go back AT LEAST once a week. My favorites are\""I Love My Ass\"" and \""Triple X.\"" The staff is friendly and the manager is always around to make sure everyone is happy with their dining experience. Nowhere else satisfies my sushi cravings except I Love Sushi!"
"2","This place was super busy and yet we got seated right away. I'm not going to lie I'm not a sushi person, but all of my family is so ya... They loved loved loved their sushi everyone that got a roll was so happy.\n\nI got the Chicken Yakisoba it was soooooo good! I was very happy with my dish. \n\nOur waitress was so cute, nice and very attentive. I loved the atmosphere of this place. The family absolutely found their favorite sushi place!"
"1","WORST EXPERIENCE WITH SPRAY TANNING OF MY LIFE!! Apparently living in the desert and having very dry skin does not work well with spray tans. I would like to have been told that prior to tanning and what possible side effects I could experience should I choose to go forward with the spray tan. I am now a freckled mess and my hands look 80 rather than 39...The result is blotchy, freckled and hideous. I was never given a warning that this could happen and when I went back to show the guy what happened, he had no remorse and never even apologized for what happened. AAAAGH! Seriously, don't waste your money on this crap; go play outside in the sun for a little each day with sunscreen on :(("
"1","Got food poisoning from this particular Taco Bell.  : (  Will never eat Taco Bell again.  I don't care how late you're open OR how much I've had to drink...it's not worth it.   If you're looking for great Mexican food...go up the street to Fausto's or Roberto's."
"1","If I could give a 0 stars, I would. We went to this Applebees yesterday (Saturday night) around 11:30 pm before they were about to close. We ordered a couple of appetizers (half price) and a diet pepsi.\nThe diet pepsi that they served was awful. It had no carbonation. When I told the server, she said they cant do anything about it, but however went back and got me a regular carbonated drink. At that point I knew that this was going to be an awful experience. \nOur food came and it was OK. Sliders were super dry (meat was charred) but fries were OK. My boneless buffalo wings were good. After we finished we got the check and then all customer experiences went south. \nFirst they brought our bill which were not discounted. When I pointed that out, our server said that it was a mistake and would correct it. When the corrected bill came, they still had overcharged me for the sliders. The normal sliders were $8.79 and they charged me $4.99 for half price. I don't know where they do their math, but perhaps they should take a basic arithmetic course to learn to divide. \nShe corrected it and we left the place with a horrible experience. Strangely, the manager never came to apologize or say anything about the whole incident. That really is unacceptable when you are making double errors in your service.\nNeedless to say, we are never going to go back there. I think this store has gotten enough negative reviews over the past and it should not be even open. \nReally , really bad experience."
"1","This location of Applebee's was disappointing. \n\nWe stopped in for a quick dinner.  It was during their happy hour (3-6pm) so some of the appetizers were 1/2 off.  We wanted to try their chicken quesadilla. It was full of chicken, bacon and cheese.  Actually this was probably the best part of dining here.  \n\nFor our meal we split the chicken fajita rollup with french fries.   A long long time ago, this used to be my favorite thing to order here.   Boy have times changed.  It really wasn't great.  The french fries they served with it were horrible.  My body dehydrated after eating one because of all the salt they dumped on them.   I had to drink a lot water after one french fry. Needless to say I didn't eat anymore. \n\nService here really lacked.  I think our waiter/bartender just rolled out of bed.  There wasn't any sense of courtesy or personality.  Sorry Applebee's but I think you dropped the ball...  and it rolled away."
"1","We got seated quickly, waiter started off bringing the wrong drink for my son. VICTOR is the waiters name. He took our order so quickly but we wanted an appetizer since is was happy hour. But he took over 20 mins to come back and said it was past happy hour time. My sons food has refills on the fries and he told us it doesnt but menu says it does. Then he said is 99 cents and should of told him from the beginning  of the order. I will never eat here again if my server is VICTOR. This man needs to be fired. The ladys next to us complained to the Manager about him. Wow fire VICTOR"
"1","If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their \""prison\"" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers."
"1","Horrible drive thru! I waited 10 mins after i paid before they told me the fryer was not on and they were unable to service me."
"1","I have two gripes.  They don't tell you the price immediately. Sometimes I have waited 30 minutes to find out.  The worst thing is the waiting room.  NO TV.  In this day and age everyone should have a TV especially for sports and news.  I have complained numerous times since I have been a customer since it opened."
"1","I won't be back. They offer the different oil change services including the 24.95 basic and the 34.95 signature service. I got into my truck after purchasing the more expensive signature service only to notice the floors weren't vacuumed and the windows weren't washed. I imagine the tire pressure wasn't really checked and all the other services that go along with the more expensive option weren't really completed. As a consumer, I feel like I did not get the value for what I paid for. This does not make me want to be a lifelong customer!"
"1","Today at legacy urgent care I was appalled by the behavior of the front seat lady. She was rude to me and my mother. My mom called to pay my deductible, she slammed the phone down on her and she cursed under her breathe. Her name is Elizabeth. I have never been treated so horribly here, but she has always been a little rude, today just went too far."
"1","Horrible! Don't go to this place... with the new owners they probably changed chefs as well. They suck big time! Mochi was ice frozen... when we complained about the quality of sushi & how hard the Mochi was they didn't care. Horrible! Stay away from this sushi joint!"
"1","We have been here many times but tonight's ayce experience made us think about not going back there again. Food servers acted like they did not want us there. Felt like being rushed out. They missed a couple of our orders on the ayce list.  My last order was the dancing eel. It was not served to us yet and the waitress was already giving us the check. We felt like they wanted us out so we paid and left without getting our last order. Been in the food beverage industry for almost 10yrs. Would never treat my guests this way. Makes me sad since they have really good sushi. I"
"2","After trying out a few other nearby places, I have been most pleased with Maple Cleaners.  First, they do all the cleaning on-site rather than have have your clothes delivered to a warehouse and then brought back in a van the next day. I'm not sure why I like that so much, but I do.  Their prices are fair and they have always done an excellent job with my suits, shirts, jackets, slacks, etc.\n\nThey offer next-day pickup and the staff is friendly.  One time sticks out in particular:  I brought in a suit I needed early the next morning for an important meeting and when I drove up, she saw me and remembered me, grabbed my suit before I even made it to the counter, and wished me luck at the meeting."
"1","I went to Wendy's and my hamburger was raw!  Every time I go to this one, they mess up something on the order.  I know it's fast food but come on.  I don't even go to the other Wendy's in the area because they are so bad. There is always an army back there and some how they can't get an order right.  \n\nThis Wendy's location has this women that works the register that is Russian?  (Sorry if I may be mistaken.)  This lady has to be one of the rudest fast food employees I have ever seen.  I wish I could say she is a nice lady and blah blah blah,  but I am just being honest.  I always call her the \""Hamburger Nazi!\""  She just yells at you with no smile; \""For here or to go!\""  I'm not sure if it is a cultural thing or what.  At least the burn outs in other places smile.  I get nervous every time I order.  I have to spout out the order very fast and she cuts you off.  Go see for yourself, She is there everyday!  I've even got her in the drive-thru a few times.  \n\nI wish Dave was still alive because Wendy's was so much better back in the day.  I hope I don't get this lady in trouble.  I just want to tell her to relax.  Cheers!"
"1","Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if it was absolutely necessary or not.. But its ok, because now they are all new. About a week later I left town and parked my car at the airport to come back to my rear tire completely flat. Upset because I had just gotten new ones, but they said it was under warranty so I took it back in.  First staff member wasn't the friendliest, and  I waited an hour and a half for them to patch a hole or find what was wrong.  They came out to say they couldn't find anything wrong with it( after putting it in water to see bubbles and everything. etc..) I was pretty upset, but figured, well If it gets flat again I will just bring it back. Literally, 4 days later the exact same tire.. flat. Thankfully I have an air pressure pump at my condo because there is no way I could of even drove to a gas station. I filled it, and as I was putting the cap on the gauge, I see a very thick, and metal something sticking out in the tread. Exactly what had caused the initial flat.  VERY upset, that they ' couldn't find it' I took it back, circled it in the brightest red lipstick I own and barged in. Store manager was there that day and was very nice and apologetic, and they patched the tire successfully. However, I don't think I will go back next time as it makes me a bit weary to know that tire tecs can't find a piece of metal sticking out of the tire. Also felt a bit like they tried to take me the first round since I was a female and was upfront about knowing nothing about car specs."
"2","Excellent service!  I brought my truck in for tire repair and the wait was longer than expected so I had to leave. I brought in back a few days later and I was not charged for the repair because of the wait."
"2","First I have to say I have driven past Fanny's for as long as I can remember. Today I had to get some key's made for work and when I finished I was right next door so I finally went in after all this time. I was glad I did. The waitress was very nice and helpful went over the specialties on the menu and when I told her I would have to bring my daughter in to try their tuna she immediately brought me a sample to try. \nI got my order in less than 5 minutes! Amazing!!! I ordered the California Club it comes with a side of pasta salad or potato salad.  I got the pasta and I expected the regular old boring side the I usually toss out. Instead I got a wonderful fresh and delicious salad. The sandwich was very very good! This place was an unexpected gem!! I love it and will definitely come back with my family!"
"2","My go to place after Bikram Yoga!  The price is quite reasonable and the staff are always pleasant.  They are very efficient too.  There are stools there for customers to sit, read a magazine while they wait for their smoothies.  \n\nI like the fact that they have \""Dessert Companion\"" issue.  I usually grabbed one before I go.  My favorite drink is the Berry Upbeet.  It has many awesome goodness in this one blended concoction.  Earl's favorite is the Apple 'n Greens.  The next one I want to try is the Orange Carrot Karma.  \n\nCan't go wrong with any of their smoothies though...I am a fan!"
"1","This was the 3rd salon I tried out in Vegas after Diva's Studio and Limelight Salon. I came in for a a cut only. The stylist I had was real nice, and at that time had 2 years experience for hair. I asked for a bob cut. I liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair. My hair was shorter than I wanted and I wasn't too impressed by how the bob turned out. I wasn't too thrilled I spent $55 for it either. \n\nI guess it's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here...Just not for me."
"2","Hello everyone out there, if you are looking for new salon to pamper you from head toes, come and check out the new look of Euphoria."
"2","I've been meaning to write this for a while, but it's felt like such a chore! \n\nThis location is great. Clean everything, friendly staff, never crowded. The wait for food is never more than 5-10 minutes.\n\nNow, the food. These are arguably some of the best fish tacos to be had. I really like that they've expanded their side offerings (pick 2: black or pinto beans, chips, rice). Not a fan of the rice, but the beans are always tasty. The salsas are all delish. I get a burrito every once in a while, which have all been great. \n\nI just wish there was more food. The two taco plate just doesn't fill me up! A third taco would fix that problem, but adding more items to your order makes it go up in price exponentially. If I'm already paying $7 for my combo, I'm disinclined to buy another taco/burrito/some other food item for $3+\n\nGreat food, great service, portions leave something to be desired."
"1","Needed to return a package to sender, they wanted to charge me $2.00 to put one piece of tape across the box. Got the wrong item from amazon and it said to take it back to a UPS store. I had to explain to her that my wife has a PO Box there, then she rolled her eyes and told her daughter/assistant to \""just tape it\"". Poor attitude, poor service. I didn't need to buy anything so I understand I wasn't contributing to their business except for the amazon prime service I have that allowed UPS to ship me a package, but the attitude was unnecessary. Would've gladly paid $2 or more if the lady was just nicer."
"1","This company will rob local shoppers on a regular basis. I just left the self checkout where there is a big display. BUY 2 get 2 FREE!  Six candy choices on display.  Only the HERSHEY CANDY BAR QUALIFIES.  Bottom right, on the floor, placement...be careful as you try to feed your family.  Good business at our expense.,.booooooo"
"2","I just got home from Salon Salon and I'm really happy with the way it turned out!  Page took care of my cut and color, it was my 1st time getting my hair professionally colored, she did several different shades and it came out better then I expected.  Also better then expected was the price:)  I think I have finally found the salon I have been looking for, YAY!"
"1","Service? Yeah....good luck with that. When you get help it's great, but finding good help at this location is like playing Marco Polo without any water and without anyone responding back. \n\nI go here because of the deals. Sales and Kohl's cash make their usually ridiculous prices a lot more reasonable. Sometimes the inventory here is a mess, perhaps those same people you can't find to help you can't be bothered to stock the place either. And then there's the checkouts which when I go in always seems to have a line. A line that moves S-L-O-W! A line with some nice little old lady wanting to write a check. Or pay with nickels. Or they forgot their Kohl's cash and have to dig through a purse the size of Rhode Island to find it...all while you wait and cool your heels. \n\nOh and one last thing. Getting in and out of the parking lot to get back to the 215 is kind of a pain in the rear. It's definitely bad traffic design on display. In short I go here only when I kinda have to and while the jewelry sale pricing is insane and it makes her happy, I always leave grumbling about the experience. \n\n2 Stars, and I'm being generous."
"2","Dr.  litchfield  is  the  best  endocrinologist  there  is  in  the  State  of  Nevada.   Quite  possibly  the  U.S.  as  well.   A  person  couldn't  get  a  better  Doctor.   He's  caring,  listens  well  to  patients  and  always  takes  his  time  with  you.    Unlike  others,  he  still  takes  new  patients.   The  time  you  might  wait  to  get  in  is  well  worth  it!   His  office  staff  is  really  great,  very  helpful."
"1","Although the pricing is very affordable, they load their meat with tons of salt.  I must have drank several cups of water to balance the sodium intake.  I've definitely had bettter."
"1","I was excited that there was a Mexican joint that I can walk to. I went there twice for carne asada tacos and california burritos and both times were a sore disappointment. I love gringo Mexican food that's greasy and indigestible but the flavors were horrible. The meat was way too salty and  the salsa was bland and undesirable. They got the gringo tortilla right but everything else simply tasted wrong. Then I was really bummed when I bit into my burrito and there were no fries. Where was the california burrito that I had ordered?! Ah what sadness!"
"1","I would NOT recommend this place at all!! I tired the Al pastor and asada sopes. \n\nThe asada was pale looking, no color and dry. I spit out half the meat because it was fat I was chewing on.\n\nThe Al pastor was mushy and overly seasoned.\n\nThe sopes portion was burnt and had chunks of corn it in which made it taste sweet.. not a fan at all.\n\nThe toppings on the sopes consisted of the fake prepackaged shredded cheese. Tasted like I had watered down American sour cream. The beans did not taste fresh and out of a rosarita can. \n\nTo drink I had the horchata.. tasted watered down and not homemade. Def came from a package.\n\nThis place was worse than Robertos. And if you've ate there you know it is just as far from authentic as taco bell."
"2","I heard about this place from an old co-worker at Green Valley Ranch, so I decided to give it a shot. If you are a GVR employee, Sandy gave a discount. Remember to ask if this still applies.\n\nI went through a stage where I have cut and dyed my hair in every possible manner and color under the sun. I put my trust completely in Sandy's magical hands. With a lion's mane and a personality just as bold, she is a hoot. She is not one of those stylists who rush you in and out, but takes time to assess, ask for what you are going for, and suggest some slight modifications if necessary. If you are in a hurry, I do not suggest this place, because she is meticulous. \n\nThe staff in this establishment are all friendly and lively. It is a welcoming environment."
"2","I was in Vegas for a meeting, and noticed the Bernina sign -- just had to stop.  It is a beautiful, clean and well stocked fabric store.  So many high quality brands, I had a hard time deciding what to get.  There is a lot of inspiration in the form of quilts, handbags, and some clothing items displayed.  The staff was friendly and attentive.\nThey had some kind of class going on in a very spacious training facility.  I'd love to see a store like this in Scottsdale!"
"1","Save your money, and don't go here.\nThis place is so stuck up!\nWe went in there, and walked the entire store, and NOT A SINGLE person acknowledged us. The sales people were NOT busy, chit chatting with each other about outside of work topics.\n\nNo thanks."
"1","Piss poor... spent 200.00 on an office chair along with a coffee table for another 230.00. Sales person stated both are in-stock in the RC Willey clearance center. He then went to advise me that it was *10 minutes* away. From the Henderson location to North Vegas?! more like 30-40 minutes. \n\nArrive at the RC Willey clearance center to get notified at that time that all they have for me is the coffee table, the chair's still in Utah. Great... so I call them advise that I spent all this time driving to pick up one item when I was advised two items in-stock. \n\nI admit, they did try to fix the problem and offered to ship to me, which I was grateful for.  However, I don't think I should wait over a week from when I originally went to will call the item(s). \n\nSo, week goes by and the driver calls to advised that they'll be delivering within an hour. At this time I was finally happy that the product was being delivered. \n\nThink I was happy? Wrong! The chair came pre-assembled, which I did not mind IF it was done properly. The screws that mount to the arm rests were either stripped or not even screwed on all the way. the bottom base of the seat that mounts to the lower end of the chair was CARELESSLY done. The whole assembly looks like they did not give a **** and just used a power tool WITHOUT EVEN ALIGNING THE SCREWS FIRST! So there's several stripped screws due to carelessness and several that were not even screwed down PERIOD. This company really cares about their customers'. NOT.\n\nSo, I called complained. NOW, I have to wait another 4 days (the chair is in stock here in Nevada) to get a replacement. Any compensation? NOPE!\n\nWill definitely NOT buy from here again. Going to try Walker as I hear better reviews from friends/family."
"1","Rip Off's!!! They did an oil change for me, inspected my brakes and told be they were fine, but I needed a new water pump for $800!!! LOL \nHad it, all my hoses, all my belts, new thermostat and radiator flush for $400!!\nSomewhere Else!!!\n\nThen when I returned the next week because my brakes had been squeaking since they inspected them the week before, they had the balls to tell me it was because I needed new brakes.\n\nWhen I told them their Mac has just said my brakes were fine last week, they said I must have driven them hard!! IN A WEEK????\n\n\nTook my truck down the street to Midas on St Rose...they told me I still had 50% left on my pads!!!\nDo yourself a favor....DONT DO BUSINESS with these cheese balls!!!!!"
"2","For someone who can trip over a flat road while walking,  cycling seemed like a bad idea. \n\nHowever Terry and his crew at the bike shop got me going on not 1...but 2 b fantastic bikes. \n\nHe taught me how to fix my bike in many of his bike maintenance classes. \nHe fixed my bike on a regular basis (after the rider of the bike would mess it up)...and his group rides gave me confidence. .. I even got into racing. \n\nI trust and recommend the Bike Shop to anyone. .."
"1","I am an OB card member.  We signed up for our memberships at Legacy.  I played the course in the summer and despite the heat the course was in good shape.  We played again today and the majority of the course was in good shape but there were several greens that had dead spots (no grass) and it looked as if they tried to cover up the spots with green chemicals of some sort.  Some of the cart paths had concrete that was broken in spots.  I guess for $49 I just expected the course to be in better shape and expected a little more of a top tier experience.  Now lets get to the worst part.  I decided to eat in the clubhouse after the round.  Bad idea.  Worst burger and bun I have ever had and I still have an upset stomach hours later.  I understand that golf courses really exist for one purpose but I feel like if you are going to have a restaurant and offer food that you should try to serve decent food.  So for the value the course was not very good and the restaurant was horrible.  We won't be back anytime soon and we certainly will not eat in the restaurant again."
"1","I'm only giving them 2 stars because from the outside the shop looks nice. \n\nBut what I don't like about this place is their false advertising. On their door and on their voicemail they said they'd be open on NYE until 1pm. I am here 25 minutes before then and they aren't. \n\nI drove out of my way specifically to come here and they aren't there. These types of careless mistakes can cost you customers and better yet negative review reporting.\n\nThis type of thing shouldn't happen. Although it might be a little mistake it was careless and it just costed them an angry customer."
"2","I have been coming here since the place opened in 1994  and it is ALWAYS consistent. The deep dish pizza is authentic as you can get  here in the Las Vegas valley. The Cheef and Italian beef sandwiches are very good as well. This place has been here 17 years which is a eternity for this town!!"
"1","Embarassed to say that we ate at this Rosati's every week the first year we were here until they closed a short time ago.  I even wrote corporate to see if they would reopen. Just imagine my glee when I found out they would be reopening!   That's where my joy ends.  We ordered the exact same thing we've been ordering and were very saddened with what we got.  If you know Rosati's italian beef (from Illinois or from when this loc was previously open) then you know what I was expecting....  an overstuffed sandwhich with lots of peppers and a big ol' pile of melted cheese...that is sooooo far from what I got.  Barely 6 pieces of meat, you could see at least 2 - 21/2 inches of the bread inside the sandwhich there was so little filling. Disappointing to say the least.  The pizza sauce tasted like tomato soup (???) and was close, but not as good as the old ones.  I'm hoping there is a learning curve with the new management, but not going to hold my breath as I have ordered 3 since they reopened and sadly, they were all the same.   Our search continues for good pizza and beef.... sigh."
"2","I have been coming here since 1995 , when I first moved to Las Vegas. I love the deep dish Chicago pizza . Good stuff !!"
"2","Open late love that great service and food felt right at home shrimp and fries and Mac and cheese to die for yummo!"
"2","Went on a whim and tried a place I've never heard of or even been to. Tried my YELP app and found this place and was really impressed the food was delicious. I had the Salisbury steak w/ mash potatoes & gravy, green beans and a roll. Pretty good portion. I would recommend this place. I definitely will come back if I'm in the area."
"1","My kids and I were about to take a road trip decided to eat at IHOP versus Denny's that Friday morning. Worst experience ever and my instincts told me to just leave before we ordered since it took over 10 min for our waitress to acknowledge us. We ordered drinks 2 sprites and a tea and my glass arrived with what looked like a baby roach in the glass. The food came forever later and my daughter had the half pot roast melt and a side of eggs. She ate very silent which is very unusual for her and she later admitted the sandwich was cold and the so were the eggs but she knew I was already mad and didn't want to add to it. My chicken florentine crepe had bacon pieces and blueberries missed in. When we went to pay there was no one at the register and the person that showed up finally to take our money yelled out for the cashier so that obviously was not his job."
"2","Seems like every time I come to golf in Vegas I end up playing around or two at Aliante Golf Course. Geez I like playing here!  The course is a bit challenging.  It offers you a range of looks that are pleasing to the eye!  \n\nThe conditions are always great and the pace of play seems pretty fast!  In terms of value.... hmmm...  Aliante is cheap cheap cheap!!!\n\nI can't complain about this course. It gets my thumbs up!"
"2","A friend of mine, from Vegas, recommended this hotel for us to stay this past Saturday. The room was a decent size king bed room. There was damage to one of the walls in my room, so I called the front desk to be certain I wouldn't be charged. This is a party hotel booked solid with birthday parties, wedding groups, baccalaureate groups and bday groups too. In the line for checking in, there was a group of 9 girls in front on me. The lobby was all ready full with a party at 7pm, and the music was all ready bumping. \n\nI checked out the lounge/bar/restaurant area. I sat at the bar, and a waitress tried to take my order and then the bartender stepped up and took over my order. Why the waitress would try to take my dinner order while i sat at the bar is beyond me (tips I suppose). The hamburger and fries were really tasty. The rum and coke wasn't strong at all (this was at 7pm, mind you,  before the raging party began.) Total for meal was 20 bucks. \n\nThere is no gambling machines at all in the hotel, quite refreshing. Next door is the Palace Station casino. Kind of a dump and not really worth it with a little tiny poker room. When I got back to the hotel at 1am, the party was raging. Note: There are a few strip clubs right around the corner and there were plenty of party people in the lobby to the hotel already. There had to be 150 people tripping on E. There was a little dance floor there in the restaurant area that was full of people dancing the night, and the morning away. Overall, there was a ratio of 3 guys to 2 chicks all night. The crowd was mostly, White, Persian, and Black and some Mexican. \n\nIf you are looking to sleep at all on a Saturday night, forget about it. The party down stairs, in the halls, in the lobby, and in the patio with music cranked up, celebrated until 10 am the next morning. No joke! I was hoping the hotel would provide ear plugs to muffle the noise... and in the bathroom there they were!\n\nI only got about 3 hours sleep. The people watching is fun. If I ever come to Vegas again, I will be staying here for sure. Rage on party people! lol"
"1","Went to a wedding. The food was ok and the drinks were way over priced 5 for a soda and 6 for a bottle of water! Really! 16 for a mixed drink."
"1","I have been boycotting the Artisan for over a year since they charged me a \""pre-authorization\"" fee of $40 for using my debit card to buy a few drinks there without notifying me of such, leading to some economic awkwardness in my personal finances. \n\nBut this review is for a wedding I attended there this weekend.\n\nThere is no question that the decor of the Artisan is legendary.  The theme of the wedding was zombie/fetish so it was the perfect venue.  However, the wedding guests were shocked when the planner approached the bride & groom after the ceremony to try and re-negotiate the contract so they could get more money out of them.  THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE WEDDING WAS IN PROGRESS.\n\nAfter that disgraceful little scene passed we had the reception during which the dinner portion of the evening was so badly handled that I gave up my place at the table because the food was not being served.  It seems the servers didn't know who was having what so the food was probably sitting around in the kitchen.  Many guests who had the steak option have reported they got ill from it.\n\nMy friends threw an awesome wedding in spite of what the Artisan event managers did to try and ruin their special day.  I cannot recommend this venue to anyone who wants to plan a special event.  The staff was completely unprofessional and trying to change the contract DURING the event  was just vicious and heartless.\n\nThe boycott continues."
"1","When I stayed here (on official model business) with Rob E.:\n\n-was denied entrance to the pool because an old people swinger event was taking up the space AND denied entrance to the pool at their sister hotel\n-had my sunglasses and watch stolen by housekeeping\n-came back one evening to find that housekeeping had left my door wide open\n-was not allowed to get from my room to the front door because they had a \""club night\"" going on in the middle\n-had to be escorted by security in the end, because they didn't trust me not to skip off from my hotel room to the hotel bar (which is, apparently, a crime).\n\nThey offered me a free night, but I couldn't imagine ever using it. Just keeping it real!"
"1","Although the decor is pretty this place is pretty ghetto. \n\nI was shocked at all the good reviews, but realized most of them weren't for the hotel itself. \n\nOur room was dirty with hairs from the previous guest in the sink (it was clogged) and bathtub, the floor had a lot of stains on it, hardly any of the television stations advertised worked alongside the buttons on the phone. When I drove in from LA on a Wednesday morning I was informed there would be parties from 10am-6pm and again at 10pm-6am. Since when do hotels take preference to the low budget crowd vs. hotel guests during weekdays? There was no room in the hotel that could avoid the awful music. Even when the place was empty they were bumping some type of techno. \n\nWhen I attempted to express my issue with the front desk it was discarded and I was given an \""oh well\"". Extremely bad customer service and room service (Mood). I will never come here again."
"2","My girlfriend and I love Chinese food specially lunch specials.  Cafe Noodle does have the best lunch specials.  Price is cheap and food is delicious but like any other Chinese restaurant, customer service is a little off."
"1","It's been a few years since I banned this place after experiencing hostile service and later found out that they fraudulently charged my credit card for an underserving tip!\n\nI wanted to give them another chance. \nAs soon as I was seated with my husband and 7wk old baby, I wanted to wipe Lysol all over the table and seats. The place is very run down. I don't think they have done any upkeep since ninteen-forgotten. \n\nThe servers were surprisingly friendly. We ordered the oxtail hot pot which was served warm in a steel bowl and the fried salted prune pork ribs which looked more appetizing than it tasted. We barely ate half of what we ordered.\n\nTo cleanse my tortured palette, I took a gulp of my hubby's Coke. Everyone knows I don't drink soda...   \n\nForgive and forget? Not!"
"2","Coming from LA, where there is a very large chinatown area, it's sometimes hard to find authentic Chinese food. Cafe Noodle is a great place to go if close authenticity, without the high price tag, is important to you. They offer a fairly large array of items (including the ones that would probably steer you clear of inviting a friend that is not familiar with authentic Chinese food).\n\nYou are greeted by a happy buddha, that stands on top of the counter. \n\nMost tables are round that can seat 6-9 people. There are also booth tables available as well. I usually prefer sitting away from the roasting area, since the smell of duck can get overwhelming and possibly change your palette and appetite. \n\nThe menu is extensive and has standard Chinese fare plus many authentic dishes. The sesame chicken is great. I always order the honey shrimp. Be forewarned though, that Cafe Noodle's honey shrimp might have more of the sweet mayo than usual. But the shrimps are large, which I like. Also, their duck is fantastic, as well as their fried bass. Also, try their pan fried seafood chow mein. I love my noodles extra crispy, and they make it just right. It is amazing. \n\nService is up to par. I would actually say better than majority of \""mom/pop\"" chinese establishments that I have been at. A good amount of the workers there understand and speak english well. \n\nParking can be difficult, so dont be in too much of a hurry if you plan on eating there."
"2","Amazing ox tail stew, this alone made my day. Great variety, comfort Chinese food, good portions, acceptable service, it's my new favorite budget go-to Chinese restaurant."
"1","When I first started coming here it was good. The service on the other hand could of been better. Their dinner here is always good no matter what. All the food on their menu is always cooked perfectly. They even have a lunch special menu if you come within the lunch hours. My boyfriend and I used to come here at least once a week or once every 2 weeks. \n\nComing from a family where my mom works in the food and beverage industry, she has always taught me to ALWAYS give tip no matter how bad the service is or how horrible the food is. Just put down a dollar at least. My boyfriend also having his dad in the same industry he taught him the same exact thing..\n\nWhen the waiters/waitresses gives us the check we pay the bill first and then place down the tip on the table before we leave the restaurant. I guess one of the waitress recognizes us and one day comes to us while handing us the receipt she has the nerve to tell us that we don't tip or that her other co-workers tells her that we don't like to tip. \nSo when she gives us the bill she asks us \n\""Do you guys not like to tip because the service is bad?\"" \nAnd then we answered\n\""No, we always tip. Even if the service was bad we tip.\""\n\nThen after that little conversation we had, she backed off and didn't say a word. When we were about to leave I told my boyfriend to only leave a dollar on the damn table. They didn't deserve any more than a dollar because they had the damn nerve to talk to us about tips. \n\nSo since then, we've never been back and never will. This place is good for the lunch specials but the company isn't gonna get our money no more."
"1","A roach crawled across our table right after we received our bill. How convenient! Was this part of the authentic ambience? UGH. I finished that last roach..err, I mean roasted duck with glee. And those MSG pan-fried veggies? Oh honey, I requested a second serving.  Then that fucking cucaracha caught my eye in the very end.  In hindsight, I should've told them and cursed them out, but I just wanted to get the fuck out of there. Unfortunately, paranoia and thoughts of roaches crawling everywhere in the kitchen invaded my psyche afterwards. My insides felt like shit. \n\nWhen we arrived at Ichiza for dessert, I threw up in the bathroom. Glamorous, I know. But I wanted that shit out of my system. I downed a bottle of beer and water hoping it would make me feel better. It did. My brilliant rationale is the alcohol would help vanquish those germs. Thus, dodging food poisoining. I woke up today feeling fine. Yesterday was my first and last visit."
"2","Food is good for the price. The place is pretty big with lots of big family table. The lunch menu starts off at 5 dollars ! Very good service for Chinatown!!!! I ordered preserved vegetables with intestines and ma po tofu. Both very authentic! I always take my family here!"
"2","\""You've got to be kidding me....\"" says my gal pal. \n\""Nope, that's really the name of this joint,\""   says I.\n\nReluctantly, she took her hungover self there. She's still dreaming about the flavorful pho."
"2","i liked it, but we have Viet restaurants here in S. FL too and it tastes like the good ones so yeah! \""Yay! I'm a fan.\"" lol"
"2","I really like the food at this place. I go there all the time, but the service is poor. And I hate to say it but, while they will help you (after asking them for something 3 times before they do it), unless you're Asian, don't expect to be waited on promptly. \n\nTheir food is amazing and the Salt & Pepper Calamari is the BOMB!"
"2","Well the food was pretty yummy, but this place gets 4 stars because of the hot waiter with the tattoos and mohawk! \n\nI got the noodle things with pork (chow fun?) and my friend got some other thing that was super tasty! \n\nThe waiters are nice, and I will def go back for the hottie!"
"2","I've been coming to Kim Long's for around 3 years now since my brother moved to Las Vegas. The Pho is one of the best I've had and definitely the best in Las Vegas. The broth is just right and the meat is cooked just right.\n\nI like the fact that the restaurant is open 24 hours. When I had my Pho it was 2:00 AM and the place was packed!!"
"2","Went here with my friends after a DRUNK at Tao nightclub. I have to say for Pho made at 330am it was fantastic! The fresh rolls were also quite delicious. Now all this might have been because I was plastered but the hot broth sobered me up and tasted great....basically 3am + Pho = can't complain :)"
"2","Always the place to go to eat before you head back home from vegas :)"
"1","Pho is terrible. The slight taste of msg, less than at some places but no for me."
"2","open 24 hours: PERFECT!\npho is GREAT!! got a half order of duck, love the sweet sauce that comes with it but not a fan of the oyster sauce on the bottom it makes the duck skin soggy. the soft noodle with seafood great, lots of flavor. Vermicelli was good, one of my top 5 choices in vietnamese (sp) restaurant. service is always good when im there. fast and friendly."
"1","bad food , high prices, arrogant owner . If it wasn't  for the the people from out of town in  need some hot soup after a long night of gambling. This place would not even make it. I would never come back again."
"1","Food was good. I went there on sept 29th after we went to surrender. When I went to to the counter to pay, I had realized I grabbed the wrong bag and my other bag was in the car. I asked the guy at the counter if I can go to the car and get the other bag... The guy at the counter said leave your purse... I was like can you repeat that thinking that I heard wrong. He said it again and said leave your purse. I told him I wasn't going to do that and if he could just walk me to my car to get my other purse. He was like no we do not do that here.  I was like I wasn't going to leave without paying and how dare you treat me like this... I wouldn't have gone to the counter if I wasn't going to pay... He started taking receipts and slapped one at a time on top of each other on the counter. he was like these are the people who didn't pay. i cursed him out and told him it was an insult if he thought i was going to do that. You idiot! I went back to the table and asked my cousin to take my keys and go to the car to get my purse. She just gave me the money and I paid without giving a tip. It was such an insult. I will never go back. I hate the cashier there. Be prepared to feel like a thief."
"2","Good food. Kind pricey as they charge for the extras."
"2","I heart this place for Bfast.  Pho Kim long is perfect for late night munchies BC they never close.   \n\nThere was only few other customers dinning early am. My order rare beef with a order of added meat balls arrived asap. The the fresh mints, sprouts and jalapeno made my pho yummy on a cold morning.\n\nAnother plus is they take credit cards with no minimum so I'll  certainly return here for bfast for the convenience."
"2","One of my favorite spots in LV!! Ya gotta try it at least once!"
"2","I love this place and I go here A LOT but that doesn't mean it is good, it is just comforting I suppose. I don't generally go late night or when I am drunk. Mostly lunch dates.\nService: I have been coming here since 2008ish and it has slowly just gotten worse over time. The wait staff is always rushing you. I think it is ridiculous to be asked 4 times by the same time if you are ready to order within a 7 minute span. It makes you feel like \""Hey we don't want to satisfy you, we just want your money and for you to leave.\"" We got our food and halfway through our meal a lady came over and gave us our check, said thank you, and asked us are we done? My friend and I were both literally sitting with utensils in hand and half eaten plates of food. \""No... We aren't\"" I commented to my friend under my breath about how rude that was and she must've heard because she came back and took the check away. It has been feeling this rushed since they underwent their makeover a while ago.\nFood: the pho is delicious, all the rice noodle/egg roll combination dishes are amazing. I mean I would walk on hot coals if their egg rolls were waiting for me on the other side. I have never had an issue with any food being bad. But I love their calamari and sometimes it is amazing and sometimes, well, it is just deep fried squid.\nCheck it out and decide for yourself.\nThe egg rolls are the only thing that stop me from giving it 3 stars."
"2","I love this place... and I'm slightly bias because I come here so much everyone in this joint knows me by name. Don't get fancy and try to order thai or chinese food here. Stick to the Vietnamese food. I like their pho, pork chops and cubed steak. This place does get a little rowdy the later it gets into the AM (partiers) Can't beat that it's 24hrs!"
"2","Excellent food, great service and very clean.  Had the #14 soup, Pho with Pork.  They even bring you the fixin's for your soup as toppers.  They have a small drink menu.  I enjoyed it very much.  Fantastic after a night of drinking and you want to unwind."
"1","Boyfriend and I wasn't impressed \nPho was decent \nBut the bun bo hue was very bland. I also had ask for a hot tea Togo and the guy said they don't do Togo hot teas? How interesting"
"1","I love Pho. I love it a lot actually. It's my go to food any time I am feeling subpar. \n\nWhen I was released from the hospital and craving comfort and a quick start to my system I came her. It was 2 AM on a Wednesday and they were kind of busy. My friend and I were immediately sat and 2 seconds later water was being dropped off and a little lady came over to our table and took our order, I stated I needed a few minutes.\n\nWe ordered spring rolls and two differnt kinds of pho, beef and vegan.\n\nThe food came out quickly. The spring rolls seemed as if they had been sitting around because they were all different colors and some of the innards of the roll were mushy. The peanut sauce was also a little off.\n\nOur pho came out a few minutes later. (The food came out so quickly) My pho was okay, but not great. Definitely disappointed. \n\nAlthough it satiated my Pho-fix. It wasn't that good. I wasn't impressed. I don't get what the hype is about... I personally think it's the tongue-in-cheek, punny name sake.\n\nPho Long, I will not be back. I can make my own punnies too."
"2","When it's cold outside, I don't need the month of May, I need some hot soup. Speedy service, reasonable pricing (under $10 for some pho and a drink), it's clean, and it's always open. The parking lot is terrible and it's only a matter of time before I get hit, but it's worth it for a nice hot bowl of Vietnamese soup."
"1","Not a good place to eat. Terrible service. The place is dirty as hell. I will not be back to this restaurant. Over rated. One star for me. Very disappointed...."
"2","This place has good food!! I have been going here for years and I love that it is open late and located in a good area. I love their fried porkchops, special fried rice, porkchop combo, and of course their pho!! My favorite is their eggrolls! Theyre busy all day but especially late at night."
"1","If someone says this is the best place for pho, you must be on drugs. First, the employees are douche bags. They didn't understand a word I said and gave me the wrong type of pho. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. \n\nSecond, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.\n\nOverall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers."
"2","Awesome Vietnamese restaurant. Wish they have this place replicas in Dallas... \n\nEverything is really really good. We ordered Vietnamese egg rolls, clam with black bean sauce, Pho beef noodle, Ong Cho garlic vegetable and Bo Luc Lac (cube beef). \n\nMust go to this place if you are visiting from out of town and want authentic Vietnamese food!"
"1","Food is nothing more than ok. Service is horrible. I wish people would stop going there so they can learn their lesson."
"1","Came in sat down promptly and order right away.  10,15,20,25,30min ..where's my food??? Saw about 3 different tables fill up..saw that they too ordered right away so 35, 40min..what do I see?? I see those 3 tables getting their food before me..WT.F!!!45,50min I think..I was too mad at this point or maybe an hour went by until I finally received my food..if the food I ate was any good (beef cube with brown rice) I would've given them 2 stars but it was bland and the portion was really small for $14..overall I don't think I'm ever coming back..what a wack ass experience."
"1","Ugghhh. Oh my! This place was alright the first two times and especially because of the take-out order I made the other day, I decided to come back. It was pretty busy, like how it usually is, so I waited. The host barely even noticed me. He didn't notice me until I asked him for an order to-go... Anyhow, I barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what I wanted, so I just basically ordered what I ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and orange chicken with a side of rice for my boyfriend... It took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. I went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if I had been helped... -_- Anyways, I paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. Luckily one of the workers there saw that I paid and said that it was okay.\nI finally took the food home and what do you know?! There is HAIR in the orange chicken... Long black hair. Not just one, but two strands... And maybe more. But I just threw the food away... Blahhh, I'm so disappointed. This is not ok. I tipped too (because I usually always tip) but this is unacceptable!"
"1","I give one star not for the food but for the service! We had a very bad experience today during lunch time. Our server was a male old asian guy. I forgot to get his name because we just want to get out of this place asap! He was so rude and sarcastic! Hope the management will talk to him so he will straighten up!"
"1","This place absolutely Sucked!!! Deserved NO STARS if that was an option, overhyped and overflowing with Douchebags...Never Again....Phok Yu - PhoKimLong"
"2","Really good vegan pho! Didn't love the sardine style seating (pet peeve of mine) but the food was excellent."
"2","Last day in Vegas .. Tired , fat , and hungover .. We wanted to go get some soup to \""burn off the grease\"" in our system. Dumb of us to come eat greasy pho but at the moment it made sense. \n\nMade our way to a strip mall a little off the Vegas strip. Tried the small #15. Pretty decent. Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious. \n\nWe ordered the fried Calamari as appetizers for the table. Amazing. Must come back for these. Its the traditional calamari but with a Asian twist. Loved it. Portions were pretty generous as well."
"2","Great Customer Service. Helen was very sweet and patient with my questions. The guys were honest and weren't just trying to rip me off. They were nice enough to walk me through it step by step and even took me to see my car while it was taken apart so I know exactly what was going on with it. Very glad I chose to stop by with them."
"1","I used to think this is my favorite pho in Vegas but now I'm not so sure.  I recently went and ordered the dac biet with extra tendon.  \n\nThe broth is pretty good, it's not as sweet as Pho Kim Long and not as salty as Pho Saigon 8.  The extra tendon I ordered was way undercooked - so it was yellow and a little chewy.\n\nThe worst part of the meal was that my server decided to sit at the table next to me and start clipping her finger nails.  I was so worried that a little piece of her nail was gonna get in my soup that it ruined my dining experience.  She had her back to me and I'm pretty sure it was her fingernails she was clipping, but I kept worrying it was her toenails.  Either way f'ing disgusting."
"1","Pho w/beef, brisket, tendon and tripe. \n\nBroth was ok, beef was good and the trip was good too. I was a little unhappy with the tendon....it was a little fattier than what Im used to. \n\nShrimp spring rolls were very good and super fresh. \n\nPlace was pretty dirty. There was about an inch think of dust on the window and shelves next to our table. \n\nDecent prices and average service."
"1","OMG. this place is awful. i'm sorry..\n\nstraight to the point:\n\n- hot as hell inside. it's VEGAS turn up your AC. no one wants to eat pho in the heat. it was 104 degrees outside!!\n\n- slowest service ever. took forever to take our order took forever to bring out the food. \n\n- the noodles were still hard. YUCK\n\n- the only good thing about this place was the the beef was actually good.\n\nwon't ever come back here again!"
"1","Dont come here. Broth is plain.nothing special. Very poor service.. we forgot to tip and on our way out the door..the boss and waitress started  yelling at us and giving us dirty looks for not tipping! \n\nVery RUDE!!!!"
"1","TRES VECES, la orden me ha salido mal!  No recomiendo este lugar para comida salvadorena.\n\nTrate darle otra oportunidad pero despues de haber recivido la comida mal en tres diferentes ocasiones, ya no mas!\n\nEl pollo, el pescado simple y reseco!  Y cuando se le comunica el problema no se hacen responsables.  Muy mal servicio!\n\nBusquen otro restaurante salvadoreno!!! No pierda su tiempo ni su dinero."
"1","I was so excited to try this place. I was hangry but nothing sounded good until my husband suggested pupusas. I couldn't wait to get them pupusas in my belly stat! I went with my husband and friend. Right off the bat we told the waitress we wanted separate checks and she was cool with that. \n\n I ordered horchata, pupusa de frijol, pupusa de pollo con queso and a flan. My husband ordered 2 pupusas de loroco and a pupusa revuelta. \n\nMy horchata tastes horrible. It left a weird burnt aftertaste in my mouth but they let me exchange it for another drink. Why an horchata would taste like that is beyond me. When the food came out the waitress forgot our silverware. Not a big deal. She brought them after we let her know. My pupusas were good, I liked the beans better than the chicken one. My husband got 3 loroco and no revuelta. We informed the waitress of the mistake and she seemed to have a hard time understanding the problem. The conversation went something like this: (it was in Spanish so I'm translating to English)\n\n\""I ordered 2 loroco and one revuelta and I got all 3 loroco\""\n\""What did you order?\""\n\""I ordered 2 loroco and 1 revuelta\""\n\""And what did you get?\""\n\""I got all 3 loroco\""\n\""So what is the problem, I'm not understanding\""\n(At this point we all start chiming in \""it's not what he ordered, you gave him the wrong thing)\n\""It's not what I ordered\""\n\""So what do you want me to do\""\n\""I want you to fix it\""\n\""So do you want to buy another pupusa?\""\n\""You know what, forget it. It's fine\""\n\""It's ok I'll just get you another pupusa\""\n\nShe did not return until 30 min after we finished our meal and only because we called her over. She did not bring the pupusa and she forgot about the flan. I should mention the place was pretty empty so she was not overwhelmingly busy. We asked for the flan and our check and reminded her we wanted separate checks. So she asked us to tell her exactly what we each ordered again so we did. \n\nThe flan I got was slightly burnt. The flan my friend got was delicious. :/ and of course my husband never got his pupusa revuelta. When she came back with the check she told me, \""I charged you for your friends flan\"" umm...Ok. When it was time to sign she just stood there waiting while I calculated the tip and signed. It was so awkward having her stare at me while I did this. Needless to say I won't be coming back."
"1","After the poor service at the Rainbow location we decided to use our gift certificate at the Sahara location. We got there early, just after 5 pm, and were seated promptly. We ordered the \""two for $9\"" appetizer and they were brought just minutes apart. After finishing the appetizers but before the main course came I noticed something out of the corner of my left eye. I turned to see what it was and was astonished to see a cockroach crawling along the back of my booth seat! I grabbed my napkin and squished the roach. We called over the waiter who at first seemed to be apologizing for the slowness of the main course. I didn't want to raise my voice but he just wouldn't listen to me so I handed him the napkin and said, \""There's a cockroach I just killed in here. I need a new napkin.\"" He took it away and a couple of minutes later the manager came over and apologized profusely, which would have been great except he said they had just sprayed \""last night\"" to get rid of roaches. So not only was a roach crawling around our table but there was bug spray all over? \n\nEven though the restaurant wasn't that busy our waiter seemed to be. He complained to us that he had \""3 or 4\"" large parties (I didn't see any table with more than 6 people). They were one cook short in the kitchen (overheard a waitress telling the table next to us). What should have been an hour meal took almost two hours. \n\nI did email Mac Grill and got a confirmation the next day (Oct 5th) and have not heard from anyone yet. The manager did comp one entree but you know I think we've had it with Romano's Macaroni Grill, at least here in the Las Vegas area."
"1","It was only after we were seated that they let us know no pizza was available due to an issue with the oven.  Didn't go over well with three kids in group.   Waiter dumped a heap of cheese on a dish instead of slowly shredding it.  Service was well intended, but not very good.  It's sad to see this chain slipping into oblivion.   This location is no exception."
"1","Horrible and Worst service I've ever had! It's too slow in spite of not busy at all around 2:30PM.We just got drinks and Olive oil&black pepper, that's all.And I don't know why though without bread. Our waiter who is bartender didn't care at all so we did wait to order for 10min. It's waist of time totally.So we left there, just leave $10 on the table. What a lucky bartender!! Anyway I would never back this restaurant."
"1","Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. Food was cold by the time it arrived. This place used to be good too. Ive never been to a restaurant that was basically empty at 730 pm, and told by the staff  \""its a 45 min wait. were running behind\"" Horrible experience."
"1","After eating at Landry's in Orlando and figuring our poor experience there was just a coincidence I gave Landry's another shot and tested this Vegas location because anything this close to the strip can't be bad, right? Vegas is known for entertainment and food! \n\nWrong.\n\nLandry's is overpriced, overrated and lacks and resemblance of real seafood. I tried the same meal at had at their Orlando location to see if this was better and nope - the same dry and bland taste. The fish tasted like it was just thawed and a salad, my fish and an ice tea ran me into the $30s. \n\nAt par with Red Lobster. No better."
"1","Eh.  \nIt really was just OK.\nThe waitress let the dishes pile up on our table and didn't stop by often enough to refill drinks and check on us. The food took pretty long to prepare and there wasn't any apology or explanation.\n \nBecause we were meeting old friends, we were in a celebratory and lingering mood.  \nThe restaurant was empty but we felt pressure to leave. We tipped well, so I don't think that was the issue... The staff sure was quick to clear the table after the tab was paid. Oy. What an AWKWARD way to do business!\n\nThe hostess (kind of) made up for it, though. She took a bunch of tourist-y photos of our reunion.  (Outside the establishment, of course...)\n\nI definitely won't be revisiting this place.  There are just too many restaurant options out there, Landry's. Your food wasn't great enough to justify service like that."
"2","Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was incredible. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1."
"2","Good standard Pho place. Cheap and tasty. Really hit the spot for brunch after a long night out the day before. Saw that they even have personal grills available for your table too."
"1","this place is on the opposite side of the of the I-15, away from the strip. it's located right next to a Big Lots and a Lucky's supermarket. in an area where all the other asian establishments are in LV. Vegas chinatown you could say.\n\nwe've tried a few other pho places in the area, but for some reason we keep coming back to this one. it's your run of the mill pho place, nothing special. pretty much the pho joint that you'd find anywhere else.\n\nthe one major minus of this place is the fact that the pho takes FOREVERS to come out. usually when you order a bowl of pho anywhere else. it comes out right away. for some strange reason, it takes soooooooooo long for it to come out here. \n\nI mean come on.. \n\n1)  broth? pre-made. \n2) noodles? pre-made.\n3) meat? all ready and chopped up.\n\nwhat the hell is taking so long?? throw it all in a bowl, pour the broth and serve while it's still hot! no need to make us wait 20+ minutes. i'm still slightly drunk and hung over. i want my damn bowl of pho! what the hell are you guys doing back there, gambling!? well... viet people do love to gamble, and it is vegas..."
"2","Awesome Pho, Egg rolls & service'"
"1","Service Sucked.\nFood Sucked (Pho broth was loaded with MSG and barely any other seasoning..it was like chicken broth + msg, chicken was dry, rice was funny tasting, and the Cha (meat cake) tasted GROSS.)\nYou even failed to get our order right even after 3 different people at our table repeated it. \nFAIL"
"2","I can't believe how many people enjoy Pho for breakfast here! Maybe it's good for a hangover or for the hardcore Asian gamers? I can't say I met any of that criteria but enjoy a good hot bowl of Pho anytime. \n\nMy order the combo Pho with meatballs added. Upon delivery - a large bowl of Pho with a side of mints, bean sprouts and sliced green jalapenos. The veggies weren't the freshest but the Pho was tasty and Pho So 1 is generous with the portions of MEAT. Sorry I'll never be a vegetarian - I love my meat too damn much! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA?select=H1AAcyWTM4lB74Y2gENNpg \n\nI got my carnivorous fix at Pho So 1 and it was  Pho-licious and would definitely return in the future."
"1","I used to eat pho so 1 with my family when we're in Vegas. Their pho is NOT good at all!!! We stop going their for years., then we found other pho place like Kim Long or pho Saigon 8 which right down the street. We went back to pho so 1 this passed Saturday to try again with my friends. I must say it was a HUGE MISTAKES!!!!! The services was horrible and the foods was NOT good! Myself, my husband & my son came in last and I order bun bo hue, it was ok and my husband & son order pho. It took them at least 30 minutes or more. After we waited for 20 minutes, I went to the cashier, which I think she's the owner. I ask her about my 2 bowl of pho. I brushed my off in a very rude way & she said \""u need to wait cuz there's 20 bowl of pho togo ahead of u\""!!! By then I was mad but I didn't want to say anything. So I went back to my table and patiently wait until another 10 more minutes. By then my husband was really upset! He got up & went back to the counter and talk to one of the guy which we also think he's the owners son, cuz he did not wear his uniform. He's not a tall guy, kinda chubby and of course not good looking at all but he sure act like he's all that! Anyways, my husband ask him about the 2 bowl of pho. He told my husband in a very rude way again, \"" we have 20 bowl of pho togo &  u have to wait!!\"". My husband was so upset then said, u can't make 2 bowl of pho for us & let the 20 bowl wait.  It only take 3 minutes to make 2 bowl of pho. We should know cuz we're pho's owner's ourselves! They rather let their dine-in customers to wait & loose them for good or just push the togo wait for 2-3 minutes & makes their customer's happy! I guess they don't need customers cuz they think that they have so much that if they loose us know cares! To build customers takes a long time. But to LOOSE customers, not  long at all! Anyways, we still have to wait for out pho for another 10 more minutes until we get to eat our pho. By the time they bring out the pho. I over heard them say that they have parties for 20. So they started to clean up our table just to get the other parties in. By then I was upset becuz they took a long time for the pho, then finally came out, they rushed us, that's really bad. We will never go back & I will let everyone that I know. Who ever read this, please don't go to pho so 1 cuz they will treats their customers like SH-T!"
"2","When it comes to Pho in Vegas...look no further. You will not find any better Pho even on the strip."
"1","they are quite generous with the veggies, but the broth is totally off. it's very bland and is not full of flavor. it almost tastes as though it's watered down. nothing spectacular with the spring rolls either. \n\nwe ordered a drink, and it was not brought out but we were charged for it. =/"
"2","Hands down, my favorite Pho spot in Vegas. I always get the Grilled Pork Vermacelli bowl. I take all my friends there. Quick service and delicious food!"
"2","Was craving pho so I came here to meet with my brother and his friend. I ordered #10 (pho with tripes, brisket, tendon, etc), eggrolls and the red bean drink. Pho had a lot of food in there which was awesome. Eggrolls were yum and I was alright about the red bean drink. It's not the greatest. \n\nThere really wasn't any service at all but I didn't feel like we needed anything anyways."
"1","Worse food ever!!  My family went here for lunch for the first time and it will be the last time.  We had never tasted anything like before.  We got the com, pho, bun thit nuong, che, and it tasted really bad."
"2","My and my boyfriend's new favorite pho place. When we were craving some pho late at night, our usual go-to pho place in Korean Town had closed early, without our knowledge. Not wanting to drive all the way back home, I searched and called at other pho restaurants in the China Town area and this was the only one that was open late.\n\nService is wonderful, they're all very attentive and polite. As soon as they seat you (which was immediately for us), they automatically set out some hot green tea. I love hot green tea with my pho. And the pho is great! I got the small vegetable pho and my boyfriend got the large chicken pho. I also ordered a side of fried tofu, which I'm happy the server got for me, even though he seemed confused at first. And the prices are just as good as the other pho place we usually go to, except at Pho So 1 there's no hair in my soup lol. \n\nHighly recommended!"
"1","If you are looking for great Vietnamese food with good service : go somewhere else !!!"
"1","Their customer service was a no star rating...  Went in with friends and we're ignored.  Had to ask for menus as well as water to start. We saw a sign saying \""$15 minimum purchase required for credit cards\""  we made a point in asking our waiter if that included debit as well...  He said it did not. We ordered our food and only had three people in our party...  They had served at least 6 people who had come in after us.  We were left waiting an hour.  I had to raise both hands to get the attention of a waitress.  After telling her we had been waiting for an hour she got us our food right away.  When paying for our bill the cashier said that debit card is included in minimum payment of $15 \n\nPho and the spring rolls were very delicious which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one lol"
"1","If there was a possible zero, this place would get it. But, Yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars. \n\nFrom upon entering, we're greeted by an Asian fellow with glasses. There were two-three tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list. If not mentioned, we would have wasted our time. \n\nSoup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. \n\nJust to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes. For a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 soup restaurant, they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back."
"1","Horrible customer service ! Every time we visit Las Vegas, this is the go to place to get breakfast before we leave. However, because of this incident, we won't be returning.\nThey even manage to give us the wrong order. We had a hair in our bowl of pho. We asked for two small empty bowls, never got it until we went up to the manager herself and asked... Again. We even asked for three plates of onions. We asked three times, and all those three times, we were ignored. We didn't get it until I had to get up AGAIN and remind them. \nWhen I asked the manager for the waiters name, she hesitated and said his name was \""Phat\"". Which was probably a fake name. \nThis place claims to be number one, but I beg to differ on their service and food quality."
"2","I am a frequent customer of this place.  My favorite dish is one of the free complementary dishes; chapchae or however you spell it.  The tofu bowl size is a bit small bit but still fills me up.\n\nThe spicy BBQ chicken is my other favorite, a bit sweet but so good..\n\nThe price tag is about $10+ per person, or you can order a lunch combo and share with a friend for $14.\n\nThe service can be good, depends on who your waitress or waiter is.\nOverall, I give it two thumbs up."
"2","So delicious! Came here during a lay over at 11pm. Lots of good side dishes. \nI normally dont like meat, but the korean short ribs was so sweet and yummy that I finished the entire plate. \nSeafood tofu was a winner."
"2","Best Korean I've had yet in Vegas. The Dumpling Tofu soup was divine. I asked for spicy and got it! The food arrived sizzling to the table. I love every single side they give complimentary. You can really fill up for $10. a person. The Short Ribs were the bomb! The staff is wonderful. I love the ambiance and decor, everything, even the simple wooden chairs. There's two sides to Tofu Hut, the BBQ table and regular. The late hours are a plus! I will come back frequently, now that I know of this gem. I will bring friends. I'm gonna try the BBQ next time."
"1","Contrary to the name... This place offers limited tofu/Veg options.\n\nThe service was mediocre and bland. We were never acknowledged when we entered, no one checked to see how the food was....\n\nWe left feeling empty....  Both in service and quality"
"1","I'm not entirely happy with going to this place this time around. Service was awful and had to get the waitress' attention just to ask for something. The food was tasty at the time but now my stomach hurts. I wonder if they even got an A from the health department."
"2","I love their seafood tofu soup! I always order it when I go there to eat with my friends or family :)"
"2","This place is good every once in a while. The servers are easy to talk too not much into customer service but its still cheap I think."
"2","Fun store! Lots of shoes, country/western wear, hats, belts, etc. I ended up buying a pair of ATS red boots that I've had for a month now, and I still get compliments on every time I wear them out!"
"1","Place is cluttered and disorganized, kind of dark too. The owner is a strange fellow. I was just looking around one day when he and some other customers were going off on some kids for not being Christian, you could tell they were really uncomfortable. I'm glad he didn't drag me into that conversation. Last I circled this was a comic book store, not a church. I won't be returning either, seems like everything gets picked over by his box customers and were left with the scraps."
"1","Funny thing, if you notice Janelle G.'s review, she mentions she was staying at a hotel room, and a variety of her reviews are from Southern California.  As a Las Vegas resident, I have to wonder just how bad the Wal-Marts in Southern California are, really, for Janelle to have had such a wonderful experience at the Wal-Mart here in Las Vegas, verily the same Wal-Mart that is most convenient to my current place of residence. I try not to encourage regionalism, but that really does say something very telling to me.\n\nI hate this particular Wal-Mart, plain and simple.  The only reason why I rate this store as high as 2 stars is because the people that I have come into contact with working at this Wal-Mart are pretty efficient, caring people doing a thankless, faceless job.\n\nThis Wal-Mart's prices are not competitive. The prices at this store are pathetic in comparison with what I expect out of Wal-Mart, regardless of their marketing. I imagine it is because of the large amount of tourist traffic. If you live in Las Vegas, like Rufus and Scott and I and others, shopping somewhere else is probably to our advantage.\n\nAt this store, I can almost never find pants that fit me, and I wear a pretty common size. I can barely find sweatpants in my size! \n\nCome the first of the month, don't even THINK of going during the day time. Illegal Immigrant City! There are at least 36 checkout registers, only 12 of which are open."
"1","Well i just went to do some shopping at this walmart and my first stop was to get some razer refills which are now behind plexiglass so now NOT only  do you have to try and track down a store employee to unlock it (good luck) BUT THEN THEY HAVE TO WALK YOU TO THE CHECK OUT STAND TO PAY FOR IT! \nWOW talk about bad business, i wasnt going to wait in the checkout line (w the store employee standing there w me) to pay for this $5 item and then GO BACK to do my shopping(about $100) and then wait in line again! OH BROTHER!\nThe fact is walmart is a monopoly and they can treat their customers any way they want!\nok Target im counting on you to come thru  :)"
"1","The cold weather was killing my battery performance.  Like the car is sputtering and the battery does not have enough juice to turn the engine on.  I felt so helpless with the prospect of potentially being stranded somewhere or not being able to get to work.  So I ordered a replacement battery, and decided to head to Walmart and have their auto service department install the battery for $10 (that's what their website stated as one of the services offered).\n\nSo with a really deep saving on a premium battery I ordered online, I drove to Walmart Supercenter.  But the auto service department said they don't install batteries unless it was purchased from Walmart.  WTF?  Do I need to print out the Walmart webite and show you what services you do offer?\n\nAnyway, nothing was done, so I did the dirty work myself and saved the $10.\n\nNot a happy camper, but getting your hands dirty and doing something on your own is noticeably rewarding.  Not looking forward to it, but I know I can do it if I wanted to.\n\n2 stars!"
"2","I discovered The Samosa Factory after doing a web search when I arrived in Vegas for business.  I grew up eating Indian food and eat it at least once a week at my local Tandoori.\n\nI was surprised to find so many Indian restaurants in my search but was delighted to pick TSF.\n\nThe food is all freshly cooked using great natural ingredients and the service is warm and friendly. The vegetarian options are great (I'm a veggie) and the vegan and meat lists extensive also..\n\nI ate there twice on my last trip and again this evening when I was back in town with my son and his friends to celebrate his 21st.  They all loved it and are eating the copious leftovers right now in their room. \n\nWe'll definitely be back - thanks!"
"1","I glanced a recent LV Weekly about their great write up of this establishment, praising the food, particularly the delicious and well-done vegetarian options as well and was reminded that I ate here about a year ago and wanted to update with my review.\n\nFor food, yes, this place was very good.\n\nHowever, \""JEZ!  Why on earth did you give this place such a low review?!\""\n\nBECAUSE the service was terrible and gave me no good reason to come back, especially with two great Indian restaurants by me!  Check it out:\n\nMy party of three and myself went out, on their suggestion, to Samosa Factory.  They're fans of the restaurant and are frequent diners there, so I pretty much left all of the ordering up to them.  The samosas were great, the side dishes were appropriately spicey to our requests so, as I said, the food was just fine.\n\nThe server, however....\n\nA) When I informed that we were going to be paying with two credit cards as we were going to split the bill, I was told this was no bueno and that I had to go outside IN THE RAIN in the middle of the meal to go next door to the grocery story to get money.  So I went off and OH HEY after hours the grocery story blocked access to the ATM with rows of carts and closed the entrance that permits access to the ATM.  So I had to purchase something from the grocery with money back on an ATM card to get money to pay for said meal.  I was NOT happy.   \n\nB) Server started off okay and progressively became slower and slower until it ended in a trickle at the end of the night.  Read the next two to see our indicators.  \n\nC) I ordered a Thai tea in the middle of the meal and it just never came.\n\nD) I requested a refill on my water three times before we finally just signed the check and I picked up a bottle of water next door.  I even requested it with the check, \""Hey, can I get a refill of water and the check?\""\n\n\nSamosa Factory just did not do it for me, which is a shame because the food is great.  But I don't care how delicious/cheap/glorious the food is, because if the service leaves me feeling like the staff doesn't want my money, I'll go elsewhere."
"2","Love the samosa factory. The staff are delightful, food delicious & such a pleasant atmosphere. I've taken family & friends here & everyone loved it. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some delicious Indian food!"
"1","Nothing to run home to mom about. Stopped in the other day after driving by this place so many times. A fan of teriyaki bowls and after seeing the $3.49 special sign, I decided to stop in. I'm never one to shy away from hole in the wall food and thought the $4 was worth it. A bit dark when you walk in. There was a guy sitting at a table to the left. When I walked in he got up and went behind the counter and turned on the lights above the food. Looked like they had a decent lunch rush so they must be pretty popular in the area (only know this because the trays were pretty empty and the register had a lot of receipts still attached to it. So I though I may have just stumbled upon something good. Ordered the bowl and he went into the back to fill up the to-go bowl with white rice. He came back out to front trays and topped off my rice with a bunch of teriyaki chicken. Not a bad portion for $3.50. The meat was actually pretty tender and juicy but lacked much flavor. Definately needed more teriyaki sauce. The rice was fine, no complaints.\nNot a horrible spot, might give it another try and have a combo so I can try the other items they have. I wouldn't recommend going outside of prime hours as the food probably sits. I stopped in around 1:30pm. \nI only give 2 stars because nothing stood out about the meal or the place and the guy was grumpy and looked almost pissed off he had to get up to help me. I even left a dollar tip and it looked like it killed him when he mustered up a half-hearted \""thank you\""."
"1","Looking for a general contractor that cannot get the job done? Then this should be your first choice. Start with promises that cannot be met. These promises are for you to hear what you want at that time. Deadlines? He has no sense of what this is/means. Deadlines to his definition is when \""he\"" feels it can get done, more so when \""he\"" wants to get it done.  Your business suffers unimaginable loses waiting on completion. If things are not completed, then there is SOMEONE else to blame for that. No accountability for anything!!! Poor representation of a business owner."
"1","read good reviews about this place so i decided to bring in my tent rainfly that i wanted to have the door replaced. \n\ni was helped by a younger woman, probably the daughter. the older woman was working and the older man was sewing. i explained what i wanted and she kinda just looked at me trying to think what to tell me.\n\nthe old guy started to speak in korean and glanced over and said in korean \""tell him we cant do it.\"" \n\nhmm ok... he didnt even take a second to look at it. then the daughter said something like \""it could take 12 (mumbling) a long time, were backed up and it could take a long time. it might be expensive, maybe buy a new tent.\""\n\n\""12 months?\""\n\n\""no one month\""\n\n\""oh ok...\""\n\n\""maybe take it to mikes shoe repair\""\n\n\""ok thanks... bye\""\n\nso not much help here and not friendly much. \n\nmaybe because i was wearing a military jacket or maybe cus i didnt \""look\"" like a clean cut typical korean. but i found that i get treated differently by koreans depending on how i dress. \n\neven if they didnt intend to, they sure made me feel that way. \n\ni went to euphoria fashion up the road where they guy actually took the time to look at my tent and told me one week and $30 bucks. way better service."
"1","Let's not kid ourselves here - the owner of this place is an Asshole with a capital A.\n\nThe guy simply DOES NOT ALLOW BROWSING in the store. He follows you around, requiring you to be looking for something specific. The merchandise isn't priced, so you have to ask him the price on everything. I happen to know from experience he quotes different people different prices on the same records. On top of that, he's just plain rude, and not even that knowledgeable.. The only reason I can imagine this guy is still in business is that he sold his soul to the devil. Go on any other site and look for reviews of this place. NONE of them are good. This guy is THAT bad.\n\nYou're running a RECORD STORE, jackass. NOT A MUSEUM!\n\nThe actual \""store\"" itself is just a converted house, and it is cluttered as hell. This place would have benefited enormously from being in an actual business space. If you thought those tiny, crowded aisles in Record City were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. \n\nOh, and did I mention he sells bootleg recordings in the store? Last time I checked that was illegal.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague! You'll be ripped off, chewed out, and put down by a guy who couldn't give the real record store experience if it crawled up and bit him. It's times like this i wish I could give less than one star.\n\nSelection: B-\nService: F"
"1","Unbelievable selection but Rich, the owner, is extremely difficult to deal with. His knowledge in punk and hardcore is completely non-existent, yet he asks for double the market price for all of his records. Nothing is priced in the store so he just wings the pricing by only looking at Popsike, an extremely inaccurate listing of eBay auctions that have ended. He refuses to look at Discogs, which is way more accurate and up to date. He also refuses to use eBay, which at first was very commendable but I quickly realized why. Enjoy the store, enjoying looking at the vast amount of records that are a part of history, but know what things are worth before checking out. I went back and forth on pricing for almost an hour and ended up saving $175 off his original price at the register. I spent so much time arguing about price that I ended up not enjoying my experience at all. With that said, check out Moondog Records in Vegas instead. \n\nIn Vegas, you get ripped off just about everywhere you turn. This place is no different. You have been warned."
"2","Have a really cool dinner tonight, i got the sushi and BBQ. The sushi is fresh rice with a big piece of fresh fish on top,  BBQ are fresh and taste sweet. Server with shiny smile they teach me how to do the BBQ help me a lot, I am happy to having a delicious food in this wonderful restaurant ."
"2","Rolls where pretty fresh tasting. Not bad for 20$ under new management price. Not sure for how long its up so take advantage!! Sushi maker Bon is on point and attentive Korean BBQ is under the same roof too. All in all good experience. Kanpaii!!"
"1","The food was pretty good, but the place was filthy and the wait staff was beyond confused.  We ordered Korean BBQ, but instead of the normal metal grate over the flame they offered us a thick glass dish to cook our meats.  This worked less than okay, resulting in longer than normal cook times and much greasier meat.  Furthermore, obtaining water refills was quite a challenge.\n\nLater in the evening when we attempted to use the restroom, it was in poor repair, as well as poor cleanliness."
"1","Doors locked, no furniture inside.  Apparently out of business."
"2","I was in town for business and badly needed a pedicure. My colleague and I went to this place and had a great experience for the money. \n\nThe place isn't fancy but for about $22 dollars they provide you services that other places would charge you 45 to 50 dollars.\n\nStaff very friendly."
"2","I'm crazy about vegas and this place has all types of cool casino related stuff.  Very large chip collection and just all types of stuff, dice, tables, drink holders. chip holders, the list goes on and on.  If you are looking you that unique gaming room accessory this is the place.   Oh, they even give you free water.   Located southwest from fremont street, maybe a 5 min drive."
"2","Fast fresh & delicious!"
"2","This location for a 12:30pm lunch hour crowd was very fast - excellent service!  The Turkey Tom #4 wonderful with extra sprouts and lettuce.  Too bad other sandwich places don't offer sprouts.  Wonderful, fresh bun - thank you!"
"1","Since Vegas has a huge Hawaiian population, there are a lot of Hawaiian restaurants out here.  I've eaten a lot of Hawaiian food out here..but I didnt really like the food too much @ this particular restaurant. I didnt go to this location, I went to the one off of Maryland Pkway, near UNLV."
"2","This is one of my favorite places around the end of the month when I'm close to broke. Good food and very affordable. Since the first time I came here I felt like home, it reminded me of my mother's cooking. No, shes not Hawaiian, but her secret  ingredient waaas?....SPAM! And one thousand possibilities. But I have tried other favorites like  Mahi mahi katsu combo, also the teriyaki chicken and they're as good as...well, spam. This place is always busy so the word is out.  If you're looking for some good affordable home tasting Hawaiian food. Aloha kitchen is the place!  \n                        You don' say ham, say spam!"
"1","I used to love this place back in 04 days.. Now It's just.. I don't know what exactly happened.. The portion of the food seemed smaller (maybe the recession?). The food is still good ofcourse it's just amount of food that we got and the service. It wasn't the same as before. Me and my bf came in around 1am, because I just had gotten off work and I wanted to get some food before i went home.. When went in the restaurant we felt the vibe that we were not welcome.. and when the person served our food.. the guy started cleaning all the tables and making us and other people seem like intruders in the restaurant.. so me and my bf had to chow down everything in like 10 mins. The guy decide to lock the doors and it wasn't even 2 yet... I just don't understand the hours here.. \n\nIf you want business.. then treat customers with priority.. Don't make them feel as if they need to hurry the eff up so you can get your asses home even if the store hours says that you should still be open anyway.. I mean i would come back but for the service.. I would rather try a different location or just stay with L&L..  better service and with good quality food."
"2","I can always count on Aloha Kitchen and Bar to feed my hunger at midnight or later.  Other than casinos, this is the only place I know of that serves Hawaiian local food till 4:30am.  The only downer is how far this place is.  I live in Old Henderson and this restaurant and bar location is on Sahara and Decatur.  No place is far though, when you're on a local food fix!\n\nLast night I had one of those cravings, so I came by to visit everyone at Aloha Kitchen.  I've been to this location many times because of the karaoke bar next door.  Everyone is AH-MAZE-ING.  First off, you're greeted by their bouncer, Greg.  Then you have Shawn at the bar.  Probably the coolest guy you'll ever meet.  Jovane (sorry if I misspelled your name) was the cocktail server and super sweet and Izzy is the KJ.  Very entertaining.  In the restaurant, there's Cyndel who's been a part of Aloha Kitchen for over 10 years.  Everyone's just full of Aloha and treats you like family.\n\nTonight I got the chicken katsu, spam musubi and the Shanghai lumpia.  The katsu is super crispy and good.  What I really like though, is the katsu sauce. Best katsu sauce I've had.  It's more tangy and savory, rather than sweet.  To me, it compliments the katsu very well.  With the musubi, they add their teriyaki sauce to the spam so it flavors the rice.  Packed with a lot of flavor.  The lumpia is small and filled with pork.  Served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  Super good with a beer next door.  \n\nOne thing that I could do without is the constant fighting this place has on late nights.  Lately though, there hasn't been any sketchy activities.  All in all, I love visiting this place because of the food and people.  If you're ever in the area, come down and check this place out."
"1","I hate to do this -- but here goes . . . . I was totally craving local food (aka Mom's cooking) and thought I'd get my fix at Aloha Kitchen.  I'm from Maui, so . . . there's nothing quite like Mom's, but I thought this might come close. \n\nOur group had the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and teri beef plates with the rice and mac salad.  I can't say any of the above was worth a repeat visit. \n\nThe katsu - I make better katsu myself and with that being said, I think L&L's katsu is better and . . . that's still L&L, not Mom's.  This was very garlicy, small strips of thin chicken with more crunch than chicken.  The sauce was ok, not best ever, but ok. Honestly could not finish it, I threw 1/2 of it away and I never do that. It was THAT bad.  And for the record, I had the bubbly stomach (gas) effect all afternoon.  Gross.\n\nI think I have a problem with their teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was average and teri beef was chewy.  Sauce was ok, but like a 2-star says . . . \""Meh. I've experienced better\"".  \n\nI was most disappointed with the hard, dry rice - it's not hard to cook rice!!  Even my 8 year old makes better rice - cmon now!!  And then came the mac salad which again, L&L does better.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  And it certainly wasn't Mom's.  \n\nWould I go back?  Nope.  It's close to my work and I'd love to say I would.  But nope.  Place was pretty crowded though and I've been told to \""order breakfast next time\"", but I wasn't feeling breakfast at 12:00 Noon."
"2","Allways loved this place. This location is nice and looks like it was newly renovated. Very clean.\nKalbi ribs are juicy and sweet.  Spam musubi are fav(:"
"2","Really impressed with these guys. Yesterday was the third time I've come for a repair on my Civic. The rear shock absorbers and front brake pads needed to be replaced. The mechanic (Japanese guy) showed me how those parts looked like before he did any work on them. He handed me the estimate on the parts and the labor. I looked them over and they were very reasonable. So I waited for them to finish the work. \n\nWhen it was time to pay I was told that the estimate turns out to be actually lower than what was previously given me. I compared both of them to see where the difference was. Turns out the guy doing the estimate punched twice for labor on the shocks. That would have been an extra $86. Now I could have just paid them the estimate that was given to me. I was only paying attention to the price of the parts. I'm happy that they were honest enough to correct an error that only they have realised in the first place. I know I should be looking more closely at invoices next time. I'm very satisfied with the service I get here every time. They are my go-to guys for all car repairs."
"1","Rating neutral.  I went by at 2:30 on Thursday.  Store locked, no sign in door, no answ on the phone and no voicemail picked up. Perhaps they had to run out suddenly, but this was quite annoying upon making a trip to the store when they're regularly supposed to be open.  A bit unprofessional."
"1","Every since this new director has taken over, this place has turn from decent to extremly terrible. I recently took my daughter out. Every day I took her to daycare there was a new teacher. All the teacher that had been employess for numberous years either quit or walked out. The director has a very impatient uncaring attitude. Not someone I would have taking care of children or supervising people that did. All the teachers look extremely stressed and unhappy and who does that affect? The children. My daughter had a bathroom incident and was wet when I picked her up. No one bothered to change her. She was crying in a corner when I came in. In a months time I received 3 calls telling me my child was injured. Never resolved. You get charged fees without prior knowledge of why! If you want a piece of mind when you drop your child off definately dont take them here!!!!!!!!!! I dont know how the other childrens choice centers are. You cant judge all of them for one bad apple, meaning the current director at palace station child care. Dont think you can complain and get results either because the director is also friends with the regional director connie. Severeal witnesess have heard these two laugh about parents complaints after pretending to address them. What a joke!!!!! Who hired this lady!  After nearly half the staff quits or walks out wouldnt it seem like someone would try and investigate why? guess not cause she is still there. I have talked to other parents  who had children attending there, they was taken out to, reason.....all the same. New director!!!!!!! I know this place has lost money and children."
"2","The food was outstanding, the service was good, the price was high. I was in no way disappointed by the quality, presentation or ANYTHING about India Oven, but the price for entrees here is shocking, particularly when rice or breads are not included in it.  Treat yourself to the food here, just cope ahead of time with the $30 per person price for lunch. \n\nThe decor is nice generic white tablecloth, the building unremarkable and the location not upscale, so these can't be the cost basis.  Maybe the buffet is cheaper, but I ordered from the menu so I could get the amazing onion bagee and a standard, but non-buffet entree, which was $17.  FYI, the little strip mall it's in is a pit--without having reached graffiti and boarded-up window status--but the food was stunning!  If you like/eat Indian food as much as I do, you'll want to visit India Oven.  If it weren't for the entree prices, I'd have given it 5 stars."
"1","I'm actually half indian, so I know a bit about indian food. I totally love indian buffets because there is always SOMETHING to eat. \n\nNOT HERE....besides everything being out and soggy and cold and DRY tandoori chicken that was ridiculous.\n\nThe samosas were oily. There was nothing worth eating. How can you make a curry that tastes like NOTHING? I mean, really?\n\nAlso, they definitely overcharge for this buffet. Is it because this is Vegas? Not sure I know why they would charge for so a meager buffet that isn't really good.\n\nWell, one time, that's it. I won't be going back...in fact, I was tempted to call my credit card company and stop payment.... :)\n\nOh, it also did NOT help that there was an annoying man at a nearby table selling some Multi Level Marketing scam at these innocent people...he was so loud we heard every word of his conversation, I wonder if he called Clarence back?\n\nThe waiter/greeter/whatever knew this man was annoying the other diners, but was AFRAID to approach him and tell him to stop talking on his cell phone on SPEAKERPHONE... whatever. \n\nI don't write reviews to be mean. I write lots of good ones when I am happy. But when you give them the opportunity to fix things and they just do nothing, well, that's just not acceptable."
"2","I am a cheapskate.\n\nThat being said, if you go with a group of friends, stay in the middle of them all.\n\nYou can deflect and make your friends buy lap dances while you creepily watch."
"1","I have came to Little Darlings 4 different occasions and every time I was dissatisfied. I love entertainers and the technically of dancing. Yet, this is NOT the place to enjoy it. \nCover for locals is $17 and $33 for outsiders, includes soda beverages at the bar. I have attended by myself AND with friends. We all agreed that the size of the venue was great but the atmosphere depressing. The entire night seemed unorganized. The dancers walk/stand around with scrunched mean faces and uncomfortable body language. I noticed they only smile when approaching a customer to converse. That being said 3 out of the 4 times i attended, I was never approached. Little do the women know I have $200+ for someone with good conversation and a nice smile. Oh well. \n\nI think the top 2 buzz killers for me was the DJ and the Dancers. The music ranges from rock n' roll, 80s, to hip hop. I love the variety but the transitions are horrible and the in between songs are almost annoying. The DJ's voice sounds like he is at an auction and you can never hear what he is saying 90% of the time. I am a firm believer that the DJ controls the hype and atmosphere of a club. And unfortunately I was very bored and distant.\nThe dancers are average when it comes to the skill level. They know maybe 1 or 2 pole tricks then attempt to shake their butt to their chosen tune. The majority of the dancers are beautiful in their own way.Eh, I'd say there's only 1 woman that I enjoyed watching. Jackie was here name. She was smiling and flirting and used the entire stage during her performance! She made me smile and had my eyes locked. I moved closer and threw her a big tip, she came over and thanked me. Her breast were so soft ^_^} After her performance she came over to my chair and thanked me again. I tipped her a $20 bill then released her to make more money. Its very difficult to watch the other dancers on stage without my face being twisted. They are not entertaining nor look like they enjoy their job. Smh. I can't bare to return.\n\nI would recommend going to Lacey's. Full Nude Full Bar Strip club. Thursdays 9pm-4am Fridays-Saturdays 3am-7am This is the Hip Hop strip club of Las Vegas. 21+ $20 cover charge for all. IF YOU WANT AN ENTERTAINING STRIP CLUB WITH DRINKS, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND GREAT MUSIC THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE!! Not Little Darlings"
"1","Customer service SUCKS!!!! Don't ask if they have restrooms\"" it's not for the public\"" but they want you to shop here! Thank Goodness there are other medical supply stores in the area."
"2","I've been getting used (it takes 21 days for it to become a habit? the experts say) to my new diet now (low-sodium), and have been going to Trader Joe's for the past six or seven straight weekends. While I can't find everything on my list, I can find nearly 90% of what I need for the upcoming week: no salt tortilla chips, low-sodium salsa, many vegetables, such as jalapenos, green bell peppers, pre-cut romaine lettuce leaves, lemons, bananas, apricots, and basil, granola, meat such as ground turkey and oh-so-cute mini hamburgers, equally-as-cute mini hamburger buns, lemonade, eggs, and frozen goods such as, vegetables, fruit (for smoothies), coconut frozen dessert, brown rice, fish and clams. \n\nAlthough, there are low-sodium options in chicken broth (still a little too high for my liking, though) and minestrone (better, and in moderation), the selection of beans are lacking in the \""no-salt added\"" department. I'm still trying to find low-sodium BBQ sauce, but that seems so hard-to-find (might have to make my one). \n\nAs far as convenience, this is the one closest to my house, compared to Whole Foods (more pricey too, guess I could go after work to the Town Square location, if need be; another option is to go to Sunflower after work, too) and the two Fresh & Easy stores which I loved, closed a while ago. But since adopting my new diet, I've found a new-found appreciation for this store, and will continue doing the bulk of my grocery shopping here. I've even got my husband doing his weekly shopping here too (meal bars, cereal, almond milk, pulled chicken). And, like me, he is reading labels for sodium content.\n\nThe first three sections (above) were written when I was pregnant in 2012. Ok, so you caught me, procrastinating...\n\nSo here's my update. We go here almost every week. I'm not on a super-strict low-sodium diet, but I still do watch my sodium intake during the weekdays (5 days out of the week). The truth is: there are so many good items to buy here, from the granola, the salads, the cheese (oh so many options!!!), the frozen mahi mahi burgers, chicken lime cilantro burgers, shepherd's bread, pasta sauce, orzo, frozen chicken breast, milk, etc. etc. etc. I can go on and on, but I 'll stop my rambling. \n\nNowadays, we do most of our grocery shopping here, then, Sam's Club, and sometimes, Sprouts, or Target, and if we are in the area, at Fresh & Easy."
"1","I picked up a cupcake from here and was not impressed. The interior was dark and they had hardly anything on display. There are huge fridges around the dining area but they are just stainless steel, not display cases.  It was a cloudy day outside and it made the inside seem pretty dismal. It was in the afternoon, so that may be why they only had a few things for sale. The place was pretty empty and they helped me pretty fast.  \nThe cupcake was vanilla and it was moist, but the icing was a disappointment. It just tasted like sugary shortening. I threw it out because it just wasn't worth the trouble of eating."
"2","I've had the pleasure of coming to this establishment since back in the days and it has never disappointed. Some of my favorites have always being the boca burger w a powerlift smoothie that always hits that special spot. Make sure to come by and give this little coffee pub a try because for me is being always a great treat."
"2","What a great little find for breakfast. Went with two other people, and we never even went inside the place; we sat out on the patio, and it was perfect. I had the eggs benedict, served by Lauren, and both were very good. I definitely recommend this place. Maybe some day I'll even go inside."
"1","We decided to come here after doing a yelp search for cheapish breakfasts in vegas and were impressed by the generally good reviews and mention of a lobster omelet.  the lobster omelet was ok, nothing fabulous. \n\nwhat was beyond horrid was the chorizo omelet my bf had been craving all morning. it was brought to us beyond burnt.  like so visibly wrong we were shocked they would even set it on the table.  yes, the presence of chorizo can darken the overall omelet appearance, this was not the issue. the issue was that the cook done burnt the shit out of that omelet.  my bf is of the generally never send something back and make the best of it school.  he tried dousing it in sauce to make it edible. nothing could help that sad omelet.  \n\nwe didnt even get the opportunity to send it back as no one came to check on us for several several minutes.  despite seeing my empty plate and an omelet missing two bites on my bf's, the waitress said, is everything ok here? hmmm, probably not.  we explained it was not edible due to being beyond burnt. she apologized but did not offer to cook another or ask if he wanted something else.  after a few mpre minutes we asked for the check, having to flag down another server.  the chorizo omelet was not taken off the check.  \n\nI informed the waitress that as the omelet, was not only visibly burnt but inedible, that it should be removed from the check.  She then had a man come over, possibly the owner, who tried to explain to us that if may have been burned because the chorizo has to be cooked a long time. bad, bad, bad excuse, even more so as my bf used to own a bar/restaurant in the southwest and is quite aware of how chorizo needs to be cooked and that most important, it can coexist with eggs in an omelet without it being burnt beyond consumption.\n\nif you are lookin for a great breakfast, try to the peppermill, where not only can they cook chorizo but deliver a hefty portion"
"2","This place looks like my house growing up in the 80s, hideous wood paneling and boring paintings of sailboats included. So take my advice and look down at your plate instead of looking at the walls because the food was delicious.  \n\nThe wedge salad was superb as wedge salads usually are. The bacon wrapped shrimp and the tomato/mozzarella were great appetizers. Steaks are the way to go here and the mushroom side dish was pretty damn amazing. They also have an impressive dessert menu including cheesecake from Carnegie deli in NY and this ice cream ball monstrosity."
"1","We came for the oyster bar and the long line was a drag and the strong smell of cigarettes was making me nauseous so we decided to go into the neighboring restaurant \""The Broiler\"". I assumed the casino might get its sea food shipment from the same place since both places are feet apart. Boy was I wrong.\n\nTwo people in my party got sick from the oysters. The Clam Chowder was so gritty it was inedible, my hamburger was dry and smelled old. To top it off a bill for two people is about $70 you can go to a really nice restaurant for $15-20 a plate in Vegas.\n\nAVOID THIS PLACE. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND YOU MIGHT GET SICK."
"2","Definetly I hotel which is more for the locals than for the tourist. The Palace Station is located one mile north of the strip. Good value, and nice accomadations. 3 out of the four stars goes for the excellent customer service. I stayed at the Palace Station last December when my mom came to town for a conference. I stayed their for a few days to recover from a medical emergency. Anyway, the room service staff was awesome, they always asked how I was feeling because it was clear that I was sick. From what I can remember the room service food was good. I also liked the restaurants the three restaurants that are in the hotel. Especially the Pasta Station, because they played alot of Frank Sinatra tunes(one of my favorite singers). Anyway if your looking for a place to stay that gives you good value for your money I recommend this place."
"2","We got two tower rooms connected to each other.  The rooms themselves had a good amount of space and furnishings (two armchairs). Our rooms were clean and up-scale looking and reminded me of smaller versions of the suite that we stayed in at the Venetian hotel.  Beds and sheets were comfortable enough. While the walls and doors were thin enough to let noise come in,  the halls and rooms were usually quiet. The marble bathrooms with granite counters gave the good sized bathrooms a luscious feel. \n\nThe maids were very good about getting our rooms cleaned and the amenities stocked. The tower luxory rooms had many wonderful amenities that I don't see even in higher priced hotels.  Amenities included toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouth rinse, mineral baths, and lots more.  The only problems were the loud fan in the room and the rooms themselves smelled heavily of cigarettes.  However, I was overall very happy with these rooms for the low prices that I paid. I got these rooms as a package deal at travelocity.  I would definitely return.  However,  I would never return to the buffet at this hotel (read my review on their buffet)."
"1","really crappy restaurants, nothing for the kids to do and the rooms are very very small. Its right off the freeway. Plus they rolled on OJ. Never had any luck at the machines and the lines are almost always long on Friday & Saturday to cash your checks. The sports book is cool & so is subway. Bingo isnt half bad either. Burger King & the Guadalajara are all gone, the buffet is the worst and the cafe is closing & being replaced by a Denny's. Theres a decent Starbucks on the way out to the parking garage, the Broiler ain't half bad and you can never get a seat at the oyster bar which is the highlight of this place.  Ocassionally a decent giveaway to players club members."
"1","Palace Station can Fuck off !!  And because you guys suck so bad, i'm thinking i might just avoid the rest of the station casinos and the bummer is i like the oyster bar. i'll survive without it !"
"1","Oh Palace Station...should be Saddest Station. Where to begin. \nThe Pros: Clean sheets, overall secure feeling, nice/clean bathroom, nice soaps and lotions, working T.V.'s, nice manicured grounds, a decent shuttle to Fashion Show. \nThe Cons: $16.95/ night fee added on to our already paid for travelocity package (travelocity quoted it at $9.95/night), musty room, smelly room and whatever detergent they use for their towels, ouch. Can we say rash on my ash? I didn't gamble or eat here, so I can't vouch for the food. \nFor the price, I would rather pay a bit more and actually be on the strip next time. Definitely a locals place. Only stay here if you REALLY have to."
"2","Long Live Station Casinos.\n\nFounder Frank Fertitta Jr. has been called home to be with his elders in Heaven.\n\nFrank Fertitta Jr. died at age 70 last week following recent heart surgery at Ceders-Sinai Hosptial in Los Angeles. From humble beginnings as a bell-man at the Tropicana almost fifty years ago to founder of an empire that is a Las Vegas icon, Frank Fertitta Jr. embodied the very spirit that made America great. Frank Fertitta Jr. was what all Americans should aspire to be.\n\nRest in peace, Frank Fertitta Jr."
"1","Prior to the complimented rooms that I received to The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, Flamingo, and NYNY I had to get room not complimented for a couple of nights. I looked up a room that was a little off the strip and found out that Palace Station had rooms at $15.00 a night. I thought to myself was \""That is dirt cheap'! You do get what you pay for in the room. It looked like a cheap motel room. \n\nI didn't know was that the Palace Casinos (Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch etc) charged about $17 hotel fee per night on top of the room rate. The fee includes internet access, gym/pool use and shuttles to/from the airport or strip. Which is worth the fee if you used most of the things offered. I ended up using everything except for the pool.\n\nThe casino itself was decent looking and they do have great restaurants here though. The rooms were pretty crappy though."
"1","The hotel isn't bad considering it's catering to the more mature audience.  The only thing that somewhat upsets me is that the price of the rooms are misleading.  You better read the fine print when reserving a room here because they might not inform you about the $14.95 per night surcharge.  Me and my friends wanted to find a fairly inexpensive hotel and when we booked online on expedia, the rooms were only $42/night.  But when we got there, we were informed of the ridiculous surcharge.  I can understand if it was something like $5.00 or something but $14.95?? If it was still summer time when we can at least use their ugly pool, i can also at least understand that.  I mean, even the GOLD COAST which is much more decent than Palace Station has a surcharge of only $3.00!  Okay, live and learn i guess.  Well, at least whoever is reading this could use the heads up, right? :)"
"2","i am shocked to see the low stars and bad reviews!\nthis place is great!\ni have been really bad about taking time to review places but i am putting that to an end now :)\ni have never stayed in the older courtyard rooms ( i understand them to be kind of icky and old) BUT i have stayed several times in the luxury tower rooms.\nthe rooms in the tower are VERY clean and VERY modern.\nthese rooms are beyond a great value!\ni have NEVER had an issue with cleanliness at the hotel...ever.\nhousekeeping is great and very accommodating.\nthe gals at the front desk are extremely kind and very helpful. \nthe staff in general has been extremely impressive aside from one person.\nthe breakfast buffet is absolutely delicious and a tremendous deal.\nmy husband likes to stay here specifically for the reason he can wake up and stumble down to his favorite breakfast buffet lol.\nwith our players card we pay $4.99 for the buffet and we have often received a complimentary buffet breakfast with our room price.\nthe new cafe is delicious and another tremendous value!\nagain, i am not sure why the other reviews have been so awful but this place is amazing.\nwe always stay here for the first night of a longer stay in vegas at other larger resort type hotels.\nwe always stay at the luxury resort hotels on the strip on our vacations and do this about 3-4 times per year but we ALWAYS stay the first night at palace station because we just love it.\nif this hotel were a larger property with more activities other than gambling we would consider staying through our entire trip.\nthis says a lot considering the caliber of hotels we are used to staying at.\ni highly recommend anyone stay here if you book a luxury tower suite.\nthe luxury tower suite runs us on average $28.00 per night when we book in advance which in my opinion is a ridiculously great deal!"
"1","Some places get old and they become landmarks. Others get old and they just look run down and there's a kind of dirty feeling you get when you're there. \n\nFor me, Palace Station is somewhere in between the 2, leaning more towards the latter though I'm sorry to say. \n\nIt's definitely not fancy or glamorous but it's affordable (from what I've heard), there's some decent food places (I heard the seafood bar is supposed to be good) and there's lower minimum table games. On the strip and even downtown, it's getting harder and harder to find a $5 21 table on the weekends. \n\nI'm wondering when Station Casinos is going to let go of this property and build a resort that has something to offer - that draws people in because the current property doesn't have much in that way in my opinion."
"1","Well first I book online to get the best deal in Vegas.\nThen upon completion, to check in they asked for mandatory 16 bucks for each night to use their amenities, internet,swimming pool gym.\nI think it's kinda rip off, since they know most people coming are just using the room to shower and sleep, most of the time visitors are out on the strip seeing the city not spending time on internet,swimming pool or gym, otherwise they'll stay home.\n\nThen room are look a like clean, vents are dusty, conditions of curtain are dirty, and dusty, just because they look nice from far, but when touching them to open curtain, then your hands get the dust.\n\nOverall, when asking for information to front desk or concierge, they put you on hold for like 10 mins. \n\nNot really recommended unless you have other choice and pay a little more, for better service and room."
"1","Be careful about booking the  \""courtyard\"". You might as well book at the Motel 8. Most of these rooms face the parking lot and the freeway. There were many other hotels with decent prices that I wish I would have booked. For the \""MOTEL 8 \"" ATMOSPHERE we could have a had our pick of other hotels for the same price with nicer rooms. Most Importantly if your looking for a bargain the hidden fees at this hotel bump up the price quite a bit making much nicer hotel in Vegas the same price. There is a 16.00 dollar A NIGHT HOTEL SERVICE FEE  that when added to the price of the room, could be applied to a better hotel in Vegas. Also, management did nothing about complaints. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Lastly, pictures of the rooms on the website our not at all what the really look like."
"2","I'm going to give this place a 4  because the doors to go outside wouldn't open after 10pm so we have to walk all the way around to our rooms. It's do-able but if you have heavy bags you're going to be huffing and puffing when you get to your room.  The rooms were clean and decent. I don't really care about the quality of the bed because I've slept likea baby on the floor before but my gf doesn't think the beds are comfortable.  The restroom looks nice though. I like it a lot. I think if they would upgrade something in the rooms it would have to be the tvs. It's not that the TV was small but because it's too old.  But hey,  it works.  I like their little work out room too.  Very helpful to relieve some stress especially for those who lost their money gambling lol. \n\nThe casino was nice. Had a great time with my family in there.  I like that they have restaurants and they're open late.  However idk if the restaurants are open 24 hrs. The food was pretty cheap though.  There were 99 cents margaritas which were yummy. At the Oyster bar I saw on the menu that says after 1am bud lights were 2 dollars I believe which is a good price. Unfortunately I didn't get to take advantage of that.  \n\nWe ate at the restaurant for breakfast. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and I would have to say it was yummmmaaaaay.  I think pricings on their food is very fair.  Our server was nice.  Very much appreciated for her service.  \n\nchecking in and checking out was really simple and quick.  \n\nOther than that there's nothing else.  Oh and one more thing if you want to get their rooms for cheap check it thrift trip advisor. Omg you will really be satisfy with how much you'll end up paying."
"1","Brace your lungs for stale and smoky air before visiting this local's casino. Sportsbook here is a bit on the old school side, but they do have one giant screen and several large couch-chairs to sit on while viewing. Crowd wasn't too rowdy, but the senior citizens here are serious about their college ball bets, so consider yourself warned.\n\nAmong the dining options here are a pizza place and a 24 hour Subway with questionable service- but then again, I'd be spaced out too if I were a teenage guy responsible for making sandwiches within eyesight of a televised basketball game on a screen that takes up an entire wall.\n\nBF makes frequent appearances here for sports betting, and I occasionally opt to come along. There are table games here, but the majority of the floor is slots. Parking is usually pretty easy to find and there typically isn't too much traffic in this area, which is a plus."
"1","its an OK hotel. If you wanted to just rest for the night in a cheap spot.. this hotel would work fine. the crowd is weird here"
"2","I got rooms for my family in the TOWER ROOMS.  They were TOTALLY updated from top to bottom with brand new furniture, new carpet, new big-screen TVs, granite counters in the bathrooms, tile shower, new towels & new linens, and were clean!\nThe curtains were floor to ceiling, and were black-out.  \nThe view from our rooms were of the pool & an unobstructed view of the city - spectacular.\nOur rooms were on a non-smoking floor, which they are strict about ensuring stay that way - hugely appreciated!  When someone was smoking in the hall, the security came right up to investigate.\nSecurity checks guest's IDs before allowing them up the elevators for safety purposes.  There was a Starbucks and a few restaurants, all connected to the casino.  The bummer was that you can smell the cigarette smoke in ALL of them.\nOur locked car was broken into, things were stolen right out of the hotel parking garage, but not enough security to catch the thief.  :(\nBesides that, the prices were fine, though the room rates end up being double after you pay for the per room/per day resort tax."
"2","I enjoyed our three stays at this hotel at this hotel and casino. I agree with the customers that complain about the courtyard rooms. Though the room my husband and I were not as disgusting as described, just a worn carpeting. The bathroom and everything else was fine, and we had a pleasant stay. The last two stays have been fantastic. We were in the tower and had beautiful rooms! The one on the last stay was huge, with a fantastic view and almost like a honeymoon suite! The employees were helpful and we were both pleased with our requests with all the staff. The cleaning ladies were always very nice, as well as the servers, and card dealers.I liked the buffet because I have stomach issues,  and this is one of the few places I can eat without being in agony. I hope in the future they choose to upgrade the courtrooms. But the tower is lovely. No complaints here."
"1","This place was alright i wasn't fully satisfied. Customer service was horrible at the time of checking in. I didn't get the room i had reserved I would have appreciate it if the guy that checked me in would had notified me before. I get to the room and the window doesn't even close I went back down there to let them know and he gives me more attitude he did give me another room but just by him giving me that attitude i was upset.\nThe stay was alright afterwards but I just wouldn't book another room there again. I don't recommend it to no one."
"1","Just horrible service everywhere. Only saving grace is the oyster bar which is spectacular. So just stop there to eat there and get the hell out. I've received free rooms from Bellagio, mandalay bay, and many other nicer hotels based on my play. Although I'm not a whale, I play a decent amount. But Palace Station at best will give me rooms at like $50 a night. It's amazing how cheap they are. Also the Pit bosses, dealers, hosts, valets and just about everyone there just treats you like you just kicked their dog. Just awful. Hate this place.  But again go eat at the oyster bar. Best restaurant in Vegas."
"2","Good service and great food. We drank and ate a TON of food and our bill was $60. Things we ate that we would order again.\n\nThe Ramen with the pork kakuni\nMonk fish pate with cucumbers and seaweed.\nBeef Tataki\nKIMCHI & PORK STIR FRY WAS THE BOMB!\nThe charashi roll-- I freakin loved the shiso in this roll!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSince I wrote this review, I've been back 3 more times and I have down graded my 5 star review to a 4 star because of the service. This place is still da bomb but the service here is spotty. Drink your beer and order two more because they ain't comin' back to check. You want more sake? Good luck. Come here with patience and a flask."
"2","I lived in Japan for about 2 years so its awesome to see a real izakaya (albeit a small one) style place here in LV!!  My wife is Japanese so she ALWAYS goes for the \""okura natto\"".  I just wished they had namadais.  But yeah..if I need my fix of yakitori, okonomiyaki and ramen.  There isn't a better place so close to my apartment."
"2","Went here with a bunch of Japanese/Filopino friends who love the place.  I was weary being that the only Japanese restaurants I usually patronize have cook top going on or sushi bars...but it was really really good :-) Being \""safe\"" I only ordered the pork potstickers and the chicken on a stick (sorry forget the name!).  They were both great, especially the potstickers.  I also tried a few bites from my friends dishes (a fried rice I'd never seen before, some kind of pork dish, etc) which were also tasty.  For dessert, someone ordered the Banana Crepes which was delicious as well.  I need to go back and be more adventurous next time for sure!"
"2","Ever since I moved to Vegas, all I've heard from friends mouths is \""Ichiza this.. Ichiza that..\"" and I am so glad I, finally, got a chance to samps (sample) the food!\n\nFunny thing is I went there on a busy Friday night and ran into 2 different groups of friends that rave to me about this spot. \n\nOrdered the cold tofu, kim chee fried rice, hamachi sashimi, tuna sashimi, pickled veggies, etc etc. \nAnd even though we ordered all this from the menu, there were soooooooooooOOOOoooo much more to order on the walls...too bad we weren't near the walls, nor could we read Japanese =(\nThis is a place where you can try new things everytime and prolly still not have tried the whole menu......yes, there is THAT much things to order.\n\nRegardless this place didn't fail all the rave reviews. \n\nExcept the pickled veggies..yucky!!!\n\nAlmost forgot to mention that they are opened late....not 24 hours but, late enough for some drunken grindz."
"2","We love Ichiza and go almost every time we're in Vegas.  We always order a ton of food.  Everything is always delicious, but I  love the chicken tatsuta-age and the kimchee fried rice.  It's always busy and there is often a wait, but it's definitely worth it."
"1","For many years, this was THE only decent Izakaya in Las Vegas. Actually, one of the few \""pretty pretty good\"" Japanese restaurants. Double actually, one of the only Japanese restaurants run by Japanese people. And so...it was busy, and quite good (for Las Vegas).\n\nWhen I visited last week, the owner/manager who always stood in the front - glaring at you - was gone. I mean, gone gone. The place was functioning like the kids took over - disorganized, sloppy  and rude service, condescending staff...like some magical fairy or Doraemon came in here and just sparkly-poofed Ichiza into another typical mess of a fake-Japanese restaurant.\n\nBeing an Izakaya, we (party of 4) did not order one thing and find ourselves disappointed. And no, we did not order \""rolls\"". We ordered Japanese food. And it was terrible. All of it. Not one person in our party finished their food. \n\nThe yakitori and gyu-tan was bland, burnt and dry. The ramen was nasty. And as to the plethora of teeny tiny dishes of stuff we chose off the wall, the only memorable thing was this nasty and (still half frozen) fried cheese thing that was a lactose disaster waiting to happen.\n\nSometimes a restaurant has a bad night. But something was wrong here. If I found out that they sold it, I would not be surprised. When everything is off, its time to go elsewhere. \n\nLuckily, downstairs is a decent Japanese-run Yakiniku - Yagyu - with a sign/font that looks like its from a Charlie Chan movie. If you don't have fun here - head down there for something far improved.\n\nStill if you're comparing this place to the majority of restaurants on Spring Street, it might even be good. And that's why I hate eating in Las Vegas."
"2","First time eating this type of Japanese food and it was great!  The food was fresh and the service was excellent.  We flew into Vegas for a business trip and my wife wanted to eat here.  It was simply a great experience.  When we were eating, we talked to a bunch of locals and they too raved about how great the place is.  I definitely recommend this place for Japanese tapas!"
"2","I love this place because it feels like your really in Japan, when you get inside there are menu items posted all over the walls around, in english and in Japanese. atmosphere is great, servers are cute and friendly. most of all the food is really good."
"2","As long as your not trying to go at prime time during the weekend, your fine. Beware, this place gets packed during peak hours. \n\nDef get the takoyaki, yellowtail tar tar, butter fish and eel fried rice! Just thinking about it is making me droooool"
"1","Oh my dear Ichiza, how I will miss you. Once, you were the only reason I really enjoyed coming to Las Vegas. I would rave about the amazing food you served to every friend who was making a trip to Sin City, but not anymore. The quality has gone downhill! I don't know if management changed, or if the economy finally took it's toll on you. Until I hear that things have changed for the better, farewell old friend."
"1","Went here with a few friends. The food is not bad but nothing to rave about. The service is ok. Some of the food came out fast but most took a very long time even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant. The real big problem my friends n I had was when we tried to pay. We wanted to split the bill and pay on separate debit cards and the guy in charge said we could only split the bill between two cards. Don't see why we couldn't just all pay separate."
"1","Food is good but their service is getting worse each time.\nWe came as a party of 7 and the bill was $208.38 which has already included 18% gratuity. We paid cash and added extra $4 to make it 20% gratuity.\nWe went downstairs and this waitress named Mami yelled from upstairs saying that we owed her $1. It was very embarrassing for our whole group because of her action chasing after us with the bill in her hand. Everyone from the tea station was looking at us.\nMy sister went upstairs and talked to her.\nThe amount for the food was $169 and they automatically added 18% gratuity which was $208.38. We paid them in cash $212 with the extra $4. Someone internally from their restaurant took away that $4. \nWell $1, $4.. Whatever it was that not our main concern... Is it proper to yell and chase after customer for 38 cents short from the gratuity so that whole mall can hear that??!!!\nThere was no apology from her at all.\nNo matter how awesome the food is... lousy customer service can turn customers away. That's really too bad... We used to visit this restaurant every time we visit Vegas. No more!!!"
"1","Short one night trip to Vegas the day after Thanksgiving and was welcomed by a sea of Asian fobs (who apparently don't believe in Thanksgiving). After giving up on Bacchanal (3 HOUR WAIT!!!!), we ventured to Ichiza. \n\nPut my name down for a party of 6 and was told that it would be over an hour. Decide to just tough it out...10 minutes later, my friend goes in to check on our position and is told that the wait is now 30 minutes. ???\nAfter waiting for about 40 minutes, the owner comes out and asks us if we can finish dining within an hour. We oblige, mainly just to grab a seat.\n\nOnce seated, we promptly order everything we can think of, in hopes of finishing within the agreed upon time. \n\nWasabi octopus.....\""Sorry, we are run all out.\""\nOkra natto....\""Are you sure you want? It has natto in it.\"" (Me: \""Yes, I understand this\"")\nAnkimo....\""I am sorry. No more.\""\nUni in ponzu sauce....\""I'm sorry, we are all out tonight.\""\n\nAfter scrapping together an order, we wait once again. 15 minutes pass before the first dishes come out. Some were decent, most were par for the course. Nearing our one hour limit, we are waiting for our bowls of ramen. We inquire and are told, \""we are out of miso broth, only shoyu ramen left. Do you still want?\""\n\nMe: \""Yes.\""\nWould have been nice to be asked this a little earlier.\n\nAnother 10 minutes....and they bring 1 out of 3 ramens ordered. \n\nWe finish. \nPromptly given the bill by the owner.\n\nAverage yakitori. Below average service."
"2","The best Japanese restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas. It is small, so you should try to make a reservation if you want to go there during peak hours."
"2","Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo"
"1","I've been here since my teeny bopper years and it's been like a roller coaster! I remember it use to be much different from now. For some reason the food is just not as good as it use to be. The chefs appear to be the same or at least one of them is so I can't quite pin point as to why. The flavors just isn't there. For example I always order the jalape\u00f1o fried rice and it gets worse everytime I order it. Por que?!! I love this joint and it's twist on Japanese cuisine but it can definitely improve on it's quality and consistency. Service has been and still is decent. Maybe we need to bring back #TBT."
"1","Friendly staff and quick service for auto tinting, but wow quality was so bad. Film was wrinkled in a couple spots, bubbles galore, and don't expect them to tint to the window edge. I swear there is a 1/8\"" and close 3/16\"" on some edges. Of course, I didn't discover the edge issue for 4 days after the job was done (due to instruction not to open the windows until after a week).  Well, for $150, what can you expect?  On the other hand, I've seen $150 jobs that were flawless.  It's probably just an inexperienced tinter.  So, if you want your \""baby\"" tinted, I'd take it elsewhere."
"1","Please be warned! Do not patronize Home Fabrics online!!! They are not trustworthy.\n\nI placed a large order online, received a confirmation the same day, and then the following day received a second confirmation that my order was being processed, would ship in 3-5 days and be received in 7-12 days. \n\nAfter receiving the confirmation, I ordered multiple custom items to coordinate with the purchased fabric. Imagine my surprise when I received a call a full 7 days later stating that they didn't have the fabric I ordered, hadn't had it for a long time, and weren't going to get any more of it. \n\nThe customer service person I spoke to first accused me of yelling (I wasn't, she was), then of being disrespectful (well, ya, you got me there) and hung up on me. I called back and spoke to her again. When she asked me if I would like a refund, I started laughing and said, \""Ya think?\"" Well, she then yelled at me some more about disrespecting her and hung up a second time. I mean, really, they weren't sure if they could keep my money or if I wanted it back since I got a big fat nothing-burger from them? We'll see if I ever get my money back.\n\nI've shopped Home Fabrics stores for years, but this was my first experience ordering online. I will never again order online from them, and I urge everyone reading this to beware. They are liars and scammers, plain and simple."
"1","I only went for an event in the back room. As I pulled into the parking lot, I saw a woman trying to cross the area in front of me. I flashed my lights and she started to approach my car until she saw I was a woman. So...  hookers in the parking lot? For me as a one year resident in Vegas, i was disappointed by the area and the lack of any kind of security present to disallow things like that. But it seems to have a very specific event following for certain burlesque and comedy shows which are in the back room. Other than that it's a pretty empty beer bar. Yikes."
"1","I judge Asian bakeries on their Pineapple Bun. And Diamond Bakery doesn't add up to buns I've had in LA (unfair comparison, I know) or even to buns you can find at 168 Market. I tried a while host of other buns and pastries, but The only thing I've had here that I enjoyed are the Steamed Pork Bun. Get them while they're hot, though."
"1","After grabbing a banh mi over at Mr. Sandwich, I stopped into Diamond Bakery for a sweet fix. Not wanting anything *too* sweet, I opted for a bag of coconut macaroons. $4 was a little pricey, but it was a decent sized bag with roughly a dozen in there. Unfortunately, they were dry, dry, dry. It was almost like eating styrofoam. Other stuff at their store looked good, so I'll probably be back to try something else. But for their macaroons, they get 2 stars."
"2","We were here because of Diners Drive Ins and Dives Tv show. My wife and I pulled up to the parking lot and it seemed kind of edgy but we went in and so glad we did. It wasn't very crowded so we sat right down. We were greated by a nice waitress and she gave her recomendations. We went with the Guinea pie which is a white pizza with home made meatballs and ricotta cheese and a garlic sauce. We also tried the suicide fries which had a habenero sauce with three kinds of peppers. Oh my gosh was it hot but addicting. The carnitas tacos were good too. We live in California but i can see us making a spontaneous road trip to eat at this place sometime in the near future."
"1","On a morning breakfast hunger, we didn't feel like eatting buffetts with the regular eggs, sausages, omellettes.  We had a craving for some good old fashion \""Jook\"" aka rice porridge.  We didn't wanted to go to Mandalay Bay which charges $25 for a Seafood Jook as compared to $4 in SF Chinatown.  So we picked the next best thing...in LV Chinatown and came about Sam Woo.  \n\nWe ordered  a Fish Porridge which still had a strong fishy smell and taste, (usually removed with ginger) and the porridge was extremely watered down.\nWe also order the \""Sam See\"" chow mein (Duck; Chicken; and BBQ Pork)  It was ok, but tasteless...probably by the extreme amount of water sprouts!\n\nSomehow, when we got back to the hotel that night, our stomach wasn't feeling too good."
"1","Food's ok I guess if you like it oily and full of msg. Your regular Chinese food. We'd ordered black bean fish, fried noddle, and some other other dish. Food's not worth its price, but seems like food is pricer in vegas in general. Waiter was somewhat rude. We told him to remove the fried tofu dish from our order, and he still brought it out. Fried tofu would taste better if there were stuffing, but it was just tofu fried with some salt sprinkle on it."
"1","It was just ok.....nothing special.\n\nTo start off....we ordered the 2 types of meat: BBQ pork and Roast pork and it was quite a small portion for the price ($13... not worth it).   Since it was so small, we decided to order half a BBQ duck afterwards.   Taste was ok...\n\nAll the other dishes were ordinary.  Prices seem high.\n\nService was lacking....we had someone who could not use a chopstick and she had to get up and get a fork herself.  Place is not that big yet we had trouble flagging a waiter down.\n\nAfter the meal, we asked the waiter to call a taxi for us and he refused and just gave us the phone number instead.\n\nWould I return?  Nope."
"1","Crap, crap, and major crap!  How this place is still in business puzzles me.  I live in SoCal so we know how the original Sam Woo taste like.\n\nAlways crowded here.  I don't know why but it is.  Probably because they think Sam Woo is the best bet for Chinese food.  WRONG.  Hostess has a nasty attitude with an ugly smug that I would like to wipe off.\n\nFood is extremely short of bad.  C'mon! They give you all the reject meat for full price.  Shady.\n\nService is laughable! So stupid.  How can they expect good tips with an attitude like that?\n\nThe last straw was when we went up to pay the bill and the girl said we could leave the tip with her.  My mom tipped only $2 because they didn't do s**t ( I didn't think they deserved a dime) and that b**** had the nerve to sneer \""that's not even 15%!\"" and gave us a nasty look.  She's lucky I let her have her hair still intact the way she was treating us.  I would have loved to give her a good beat down.\n\n0 stars! Why can't I give this place 0 stars?! I hope this place burns down to the ground."
"1","I used to go to Sam Woo when it first opened and always like the bbq pork fried rice and the sliced bbq pork which were always good.  I had to give the place a break after trying other dishes that weren't so great, and also because they have been closed several times by the health department. I've gone there when they had a B rating, and turned around and walked out.  Keep your eye on them, I think you can find the latest restaurant ratings in the RJ."
"1","The Food:\nSam Woo's has been shut down for health code violations a number of times within the past 10 years!  I was able to peak in their kitchen and noticed it was VERY dirty!  They had two huge pots with broth sitting on the floor.....on the floor!!!  \nThe Service:\nService staff currently works as though they were still living in China.  Culturally, American culinary (front and back house) service is very different from Chinese.  In China, people don't care if their server has the personality of a wall; they're only there to take their order and provide the food.  However, most Americans appreciate a server with a good personality and one who is genuine for the most part.  If you order a beverage, be sure to ask for a pitcher in advance because they only fill your glass up once....after that you've got to literally grab them by their shirt to stop them from brushing you off!  I feel as if there's better, more genuine customer service at McDonalds! \n\n-This place needs improvement in all areas\n\n*I've gotten the shits from this food every time I've eaten here!  I think that's saying something about their food."
"1","We went here over Memorial weekend for brunch after church. We wanted to go to Harbor Palace, because that's where we usually go...but it had a long wait. Sam Woo was our second stop. It was pretty crowded, as expected. When we walked in the hostess station was empty, so we made our way to the cashier and asked to be put on the waiting list. She rudely told us to go back to the hostess station and wait for her there. We were given a ticket with the number 1 on it, so I was pretty hopeful. After about 20 minutes of waiting, we noticed that people that arrived after us were being seated. We got even more suspicious when the hostess asked us again how many were in our party & gave us a ticket with the number 8 on it. Things were obviously very disorganized.\n\nMy mom then caught the hostess' attention and asked her exactly how their seating was conducted, because we had been waiting awhile, parties were being seated before us that arrived after, and she wasn't calling any numbers. Her reply was, and I kid you not \""You know, don't worry about it. They have the bigger party and their table became available first. You just have to wait for a smaller table, so don't worry about it.\""\n\nIt was so rude. I think she realized she said something wrong, because as were were leaving (didn't want to patronize a place like that) she said \""I have your table ready for you now.\"" My mother turned around, handed her the ticket back and said \""You know, don't worry about it.\""\n\nThe look on that hostess' face was priceless :)"
"1","Date/Time:  Saturday - 7:30pm\nOccasion:  Dinner with daddy and little brother\nParty of:  Three\nLocation:  Typical Chinese restaurant. Simple decor. Not the cleanest\nOrdered:  Westlake Beef Soup, Flamebroiled Pepper-Beef Steak, Ginger Chicken, and Seafood-Tofu claypot\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$\n\nExpensive.  Definitely gone down-hill.  And quite simply put, not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning was the soup.  The pepper beef steak was sliced way too large and quite difficult to chew.  The ginger chicken was terribly dry.  And I wasn't interested in taking another bite of the seafood tofu claypot.\n\nTo top it off, each entree ran $12 - $18.  $60 for four entrees at a Chinese restaurant?? Definitely not worth it it!  I've typically gone here for lunch and ordered noodles.  Now I'm scared and likely not to return.  I'm going to stick with pho in Chinatown from now on.  Fellow yelpers: any suggestions on other better Chinese restaurants in the area? ;)"
"1","Food may be decent, but when mixed with horrible service and CASH ONLY, I think not."
"1","OMGk,  this place was the worst chinese I've ever eating,  first the service was like they were doing us a favor for throwing a menu at me I said Hi he didn't.  Then when we got our food, the soup was cold, he took them screaming to the kitchen,  Soup cold again, We received it back microwave hot, and our spoons almost burning us that where still in the soup. The meal was salty rice blane, and very little meat in each one of our meals, that where already price highter than usually for lunch time menu.  I'm from San Francisco, have been to hold in the walls and had better food.  Even where I live Livermore, Ca,  where there is hardly any chinese rest.  Save your money and taste and go a couple of doors down.."
"1","Was a bit skeptical having lunch here because of all the negative reviews, but we came based on my cousin's recommendation who lives in Vegas and has eaten here numerous time.\n\nThe positives:\n+ Food came out very fast.  We were very hungry, so this was a bonus.\n+ Food was tasty.  We had: beef chow fun, kung pao chicken, roast duck, roast pork, scallops with vegetables, choi sum, fried calamari. \n\nThe negatives:\n- Cash only. \n- Extremely RUDE service.  Staff was more interested in eating their own lunch than taking our order of filling our water cups.  Actually, they never filled our water cups, just plopped a pitcher of water on our table and walked away.  As a matter of fact, that's how all of our dishes were delivered - server just dropping the dish on our table and walking away.  Never asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything.  Also forgot to give us the rice we ordered - had to remind the waiter.  Only made an attempt at being pleasant when it was time to deliver the bill.\n\nWon't be going out of our way to eat here again."
"1","CRAPPIEST CHINESE JOINT I'VE EVER EATEN AT! AVOID! \n\nI don't want to give it one star, but there's not an option for NO STARS on here. This place is CRAP.\n\nIt's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...\n\nAnyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, \""What do you want?\"". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.\n\nWhat we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't. \n\nWhen we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it. \n\nDon't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service."
"1","Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap."
"1","What a disappointment this place was! I was told by a friend about the amazing duck dishes this place used to serve and last week found myself with an opportunity to check the place out. Let's just say I will not be going back.\n\nMy colleague and I walked in at 12:30 pm. I was afraid that we would have to wait for a table as this was right in the middle of the lunch rush, but shockingly, there was not a table occupied in the whole joint. This should have been a red flag but we stayed, regardless.\n\nWhile looking at the menu I realized it was a cash only restaurant (and the menu items are all fully priced). This relegated me to the cash that I had in my wallet -- bummer.\n\nThey have an excessively long menu and after a great deal of reading decided I'd just get the chicken lo mein since I thought that was un-mess-up-able. I thought wrong! I was presented with a huge dish of the nastiest tasting, ugliest pile of beige. The chicken was little more than tiny pieces of salty poached rib meat and gristle.\n\nSide note: the server had a fungal infection under his fingernails. That's not exactly the last thing I want to see before I dig into a meal...gross.\n\nI wound up eating about 6 mouthfuls of noodles before I could tolerate no more. The horrible taste stayed with me all day. I will never return."
"1","Don't go here if you aren't Chinese ...they will help everyone else first. We got there and they tried to sit the people behind us first until they said no they were here first. We sat for 10 minutes and watched them seat and serve 3 tables after us until we got up and walked out."
"1","This use to be our go to place.  Now the service is horrible. \n\nLast night 11/23/2013 we ordered shrimp chow mein which is my favorite aside from wonton soup.  \n\nThe service for take out   was a bit better then actually dining in. \n\nOur order was ready in about five min,  i double checked my order  the sauce and the noodle are seperate. They gave us more then enough of both the broth and noodle. The taste was ok (eatable)    was not the best !   Like the one in Cal. \n\nAnd it satisfied the craving."
"1","Do Not eat here!!!! Unless you want to get rip off!!! They charge me $9.95 for a side order of bean sprout. Should be around $2. I will never come back here!!!"
"1","I've been to Sam Woo in NYC, Toronto, LA and Orange County.  This one in Vegas is by far the worst.  The bbq meats and the meals are a significant notch below the others  I've had bbq pork which was really dry, and I was surprised they served it.  The best bbq offering is the stewed pork stomach.  At the other Sam Woo's, my favorite dish to order is the salted fish and chicken fried rice.  However in this location, there didn't seem to have any salted fish flavor.  The beef chow fun is lacking in beef.  And to top it off, the place is not as clean as the others.  I've gone here around 7-8 times, hoping that things would be improved, but I have moved on to other chinese restaurants as there are simply too many other options in Chinatown."
"2","Great hand rolled cigars comfortable couches and a great environment to relax and enjoy your cigar"
"1","What a shame...this store is closing after 21 years in business.  The family that owns the Red Rooster is moving to Illinois.  The lady that runs the place was very friendly and told me this after I inquired about the closing 7/15/10 sign on the door.\n\nThey used to have multiple floors and many rooms.  Now, they are reduced to a garage sale amount of stuff that appears to have been picked over.\n\nI am sure this was a 4 or 5-star place at one time, however that day has passed.  The good news is that the Charleston Antique Mall is in full swing literally next door.  Go there instead."
"1","I came to this cleaners for a bridesmaid dress to be altered and I was extremely happy with it.  Since I live close by I figured I would try the Dry Cleaning side of.  I will NEVER EVER come back to this place again.  I feel like I was totally ripped off.  \n\nI dropped my clothes off on a Thursday and she said to pick them up on Tuesday.  (Open all weekend so why so long).  I came in today Tuesday at 4pm.  She told me they JUST STARTED working on my items and she would call me when they would be ready.  1 hour later she said they were ready.  I picked them up, took them home and this is when I get heated.  \n\nMy Herve Leger dress I dropped off was the only thing that looked cleaned.  I had black shoe polish stains on it from an event I had attended and lucky for me they came out and the dress looked brand new.  I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!"
"2","have you ever visited Korea or gone to a very traditional Korean restaurant that is run by Koreans with Korean servers?  If you have, you are well aware that their service isn't all about smiles and chatting, but one of diligence and speed.  Some reviewers before me complained about the service being awful, but I assume they aren't used to the way things are run in places like this.  It may not be an excuse, but as long as I get my drink refills and food on time and they pass by and glance at our table to ensure that we are constantly well kept, I don't care if Chung Li smiles at me or not.  If they do their job well, I'm happy.\n\nWith that off my shoulders, let's get to the juicy review!  This is the sister restaurant of Maru in Summerlin, and I have to say that I prefer this place over Maru any day of the year.  We discovered this place on a whim after trying the restaurant below this one (it was horrid). We walked in and there's a faux well in the dining area and everything is clean and well kept.  That's always a good sign.  They seat you or you tell them where you want to be seated, you get the menu and begin the experience.\n\nThey have a variety of traditional Korean dishes, and with the Korean patrons eating there when we first arrived I knew this would be good.  We ordered our typical dishes--bulgogi and kalbi, shrimp tempura appetizer to start.  We asked that they cook it in the back, and they did.  Our tempura was out on our table within five minutes along with the usual side dishes.  I personally love the picked radish and croquette.  Their rokio is good, too, although not the typical white pearl onion version.\n\nOur food arrived promptly, and we waited no more than ten minutes (if that) for the food.  It was good.  I mean really, really good.  When the waitress brought out the salad and then--wait for it.....the radish beef soup,. i wanted to cry.\n\nLet me explain my need for this soup.\n\nWhen I was five years old my parents took me to a Korean BBQ restaurant back home.  They served this awesome clear broth soup with what I assumed was thinly sliced potatoes and maybe a touch or two of beef.  As simple as it sounds, it's a traditional soup appetizer to have with a Korean meal, and I've eaten it every time I had BBQ out at a restaurant.  For two and a half years we searched Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas for this appetizer, and for some reason none of them serve it.  Finally, after 2.5 years of searching, when the girl brought the soup out in its traditional low-rimmed bowl and I had to use the typical long-stemmed spoon to eat it, i teared up.  My childhood wafting in my face with the smells of radish and beef broth.  It was a great moment.  The soup is simple and contains nothing but clear brother flavored by the radish and beef, with thin slices of radish and one or two pieces of shredded beef in the bowl.  It's simply yummy.\n\nAfter eating two bowls of it along with the great BBQ and appetizer, I was stuffed and thoroughly happy. I craved the BBQ daily for a week and satisfied my craving for dinner that week.  I never get sick of bulgogi and kalbi.  \n\nWhen I finally cooked it at our table one night I decided that was the way to go from now on because I could burn my bulgogi a bit more than the cooks in the back would to get that sweeter flavor.  If you ever go to a Korean bbq place, cook it yourself.  It's fun and tasty!\n\nOverall, a great experience, and my only BBQ place where they serve my childhood soup.  I'm looking forward to more of their food again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.  I know that I sing high praises over the soup and the food, but it honestly is that good and is the only spot we will eat Korean food from now on."
"2","If i am craving Korean BBQ this is the place i come. They always have great tasting Bulgogi/Kalbi and the Banchans they offer are great. The service is always good and attentive."
"1","My cousin took us here to try this place out since it's one of her favorite  spots.\nNot a fan of their service since they were REALLY short handed.  Never checked on us until the end of the meal.  Things were forgotten.\nWe ordered the steamed egg since it's my daughter's favorite dish, but it was overcooked.  She didn't eat as much as she normally does when it's yummy.\nBut, if service doesn't bother you then this place has good BBQ."
"1","Can't do all you can eat by yourself. Seems unfair to pay more for just a single item on the menu when I couldn't get someone to join me and get the 15.99 price."
"2","Come here to get my Korean bbq fix usually pretty good but service can be a hit or miss and you cant beat the AYCE price tag I always get the Nevada because all I get is either the brisket or pork belly love their side dishes too"
"2","Came here to try it for the first time. Service was really nice and fast. Even helped cook our meat sometimes. We got the $15.95. All good cause it was pretty good stuff. The brisket is good. Salad is pretty good. I like the flavor. Steamed egg was tasty. Their rice is nice and hot. Marinated spicy chicken was unique and yummy. Kimchi was really good and cold. Water was always refilled quickly without asking. They know how to do work here! Got the check and was confused why it was more expensive than we thought. We just decided to pay for it anyways. When we went to the cashier I saw on the menu it said they automatically ass gratuity to all parties 5 or less 15% or more 18%. Then out loud I said \""oh babe that's why, they already charged us for gratuity.\"" She looked at us and looked concerned and I replied \""sorry it was our first time here.\"" And then she was quick to apologize and say \""oh I'm sorry I didn't know usually our customers know so we don't say anything..\"" And I said it was fine. She was really nice about it and I can tell it was a genuine response. The place is cute and clean too. Thumbs up to Korean garden! Now I know why people go here."
"1","MY FIRST REVIEW AS AN ELITE MEMBER! WISH IT WAS A 5 STAR REVIEW BUT...\n\nI have never been to a more disgusting place ever. I do not want to go into the sanitary and cleanliness of this restaurant due to Yelp rules but I will say that \""Dirty Dining\"" should definitely investigate. \n\nHonestly not a big fan of Korean BBQ but family wanted to eat here. It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalape\u00f1os, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself. \n\nwe had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her. Our drinks came after we got the food which was pretty unacceptable. I was thirsty! So we were eating spicy food without any waters for a good 10 minutes. \n\nNever will come back & I do not recommend this place to anybody!"
"1","Second time I've been here and it's still the same. We ordered the \""vegas\"" style all you can eat because we liked the Kalbi. Everything is tasty yet the service there is absolutely horrible. We didn't get any plates, water, and rice when all of our meat came out. Whenever we asked for more water or more for some help with our grill, we got an attitude and had to wait more. Took us about 3 hours to get done instead of an hour or two if we had good service. Won't come here again."
"1","OK so DON'T go here... it's that easy!!! There were so many things wrong with my dining experience it's hard to even figure out where to begin!\n\n1) SERVICE-- I went on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar so I could watch football. The poor bartender does everything here.  She had 9 people at the bar, was cleaning glasses, answering the phone,getting our food  AND she has to make all the drinks for the waiters. And when I say ALL the drinks, they come up to her for a COKE, they don't even have a fountain drink machine for the waiters to do it themselves.  Needless to say, it took her a while to get my food ordered. There also was a group of 3 guys that sat next to me that were ordering food and playing video poker too [hold that thought].\n\n2) DRINKS--They have video poker at the bar. Fine by me. THEY DON'T COMP your DRINKS at the bar. Unheard of in Vegas. I lost $40 bucks and still paid FULL price for my 2 glasses of wine.\n\n3) FOOD--Bread? They have bread here???? Based on the other reviews apparently they do. We didn't' see any bread at the bar- carb free for us! My meal came out before my salad. Noooo bueno.  Also, about 25 mins after I ordered my meal arrived. WHY so long you ask? Because the bartender has to leave the BAR and go get the food herself. I have never in my life seen a restaurant where the bartender goes and gets her own food.  The reasoning for my salad coming out late, the waiters were getting there before her, and since the Caesars are made to order I lucked out.  Let's talk about the food...I order the combination meal-petite fillet, salad, veggie, & shrimp scampi to the tune of $65. \n\nOutback has better steak then this place. It was really dry [see pix] there wasn't even any juice on the plate. When I think of shrimp scampi-garlic, white wine, shrimp, butter, and parsley comes to mind.  This was NOT that.  It was gelatinous kinda like shark fin soup & the tails were still on the 5 shrimp.  Side of broccoli extremely undercooked. It needed 2 or 3 more minutes in the microwave from where it came from.\n\nGuys next to me started laughing when my food arrived. Then I one upped them told them I bet their apps come out with their food....well I was sort of right. Their food came out, but there were no apps with it. So poor little bartender, now has to leave the bar, for about the 5th time [with 9 people at it PS-it only seats 12] and once again go get our food. \n\nPS- I complained about the order in which the food came out, hostess did come talk to me [she might have been the manager] instead of apologizing, offering me a dessert, taking off a glass of wine, she told the bartender if she starts to get behind let her know and she'll help out.  I mentioned to her too the same thing happened to the guys next to me. She offered no apologies and didn't even go speak with them.\n\nMind you we are drinking, eating, AND playing at this place.  My meal cost me well over $125 and was worth about $30 in my opinion.\n\nAgain STK or Botero are much better options. I also have no idea how anyone else had a GOOD experience here as this might be the worst experience I've had in Vegas and maybe in a restaurant period."
"1","I was very excited to check this place out, it had been written up as one of the classic/oldest steak houses in Vegas so my co-workers and I went in with great expectations. \nWhen we arrived the dinning room was almost completely empty, the hostess was very sweet and set us up in a nice booth. This is where things started falling apart, it comes down to just crappy service. The waiters, dressed in tuxes gathered in a group outside the kitchen and showed little to no interest in providing any level of service. When a waiter did show up to take my coworkers drink order my coworker  asked if they had any IPA's to which the waiter said  that they had Heineken my coworker pointed out that this was not an IPA which the waiter then disputed. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I can't say enough about how bad the service was I'm pretty easy going but I was pissed my the time we were done eating. The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars otherwise it would be one star. \nWhen we were leaving  we told the hostess of our dissatisfaction and she took down our emails and assured us that we'd be taken care of and would receive some sort of compensation, over a week later this hasn't happened."
"1","It was my husbands 30th birthday! His father was in town with his girlfriend   ... And wanted to take us out to dinner... We were having a hard time coming up with somewhere to eat...and I suggested the Golden Steer..have never been, but a landmark in Vegas I had always wanted to try... I am a upscale hairstylist and take many clients out and suggest many places to clients... Who are also educated and well to do.... \nWe had reservations for 4 people at 7:45...\n    We walked in and over to his father and girlfriend sitting at the bar... they looked a bit frustrated...said they had been sitting there for 10+ mins and had not been offered a drink.. Said that \""It  seemed as if bartender couldnt have been bothered\""... Tried asking the bartender myself for a service when he had a moment... Didn't really aknowlage me and we stood there another 5 mins... I guess that should have been our sign... Decided to just go to dinner and order wine at the table... Stood at the front podium where I noticed an older lady who was our hostess? No greeting .. Just 4? And turns....we follow hoping that we should be .... Sit at the table and young man offers us water.., yes please and can we order some wine?\n             Then our waiter appears...      Fabian, I'm told later, he states  \""So we are in dire need of drinks!??\"" with a condescending undertone, but doesn't even have the wine menu with him!.. Walks back and practically drops it in my husbands lap.  Another 15 mins later ! Comes back and we eagerly order wine and an appetizer. Fabian \""our waiter\"" doesnt ask if there is a special occasion? nor does he introduce himself..or anything of that nature a waiter should do...  we are now all picking up his rude attitude around the table.. My father in laws girlfriend leans into me and says ... Did we do something wrong to our waiter? I has just wondered that myself I replied... With a shrug..;(\nWhen the wine and appetizer comes its been another length of time... Fabian drops it off and my husband has to call to him, quickly as he is already 10 feet from our table  ... \""Excuse me... But may we order please ??\"" \nThen he hastily takes our order in a way as if he is too busy to be doing so, doesn't write it down.. ...doesn't take our enormous menus from the table.\nMy husband asks him to \""Please be more diligent with us and  would you mind checking on us more often, we also need...........\"" ( I kid you not as he asking him this he is literally shaking his head yes while walking away before he can actually finish his sentence! \nA few more minutes later a NEW waiter comes, I guess Fabian just handed us off?, with our wine and is much nicer but pours my Cabernet into my father in laws Zinfandel glass with wine actually still in it (cab is red and zin is pink)  I'm sure everyone knows and hate to say it but its absolutely a fau pas to do that..... .. Wow ! That's never actually happened before ) gives me my husbands merlot and  2 down and 2 to go... Father in laws girlfriend gets her Chardonnay (yay!) and no Zinfandel for for him;(.   Ah yes okay 3 wrong 1 right... Hahaha its almost comical how bad this is going\nThe rest if the dinner is satisfactory.. ALL IN ALL... the food was very decent,  service sucked so  horribly bad that the overpriced (decent food ) was NOT worth it!! \nWill be telling my family friends and  clients not to go.."
"1","We have been coming here for many, many, many years. Haven't been for the past 5 years or so, decided to re-visit some old school charm! No sooner were we seated that we were asked what we wanted to drink and what we wanted to order. I had to explain we were in no hurry to order dinner, wanted a drink first. While waiting for our one drink and bottle of wine, two more servers appeared to ask for our order.  Finally we gave in, not even 1/2 way through our drinks. Caesar salad still served tableside, server overdid the oil so all you tasted was oil. Ordered the filet, medium rare, was served to me raw+, sent it back and within seconds (no time whatsoever) to cook was served to me again and yep, raw, couldn't even cut it with a knife. Seriously? The best steakhouse in Las Vegas...not anymore. Decided not to chance a 3rd time. The baked potato was a baked potato. The b\u00e9arnaise that was served with the first filet, sat there and got cold while someone in the kitchen attempted to cook the filet to medium rare.  The veal parmesan was adequate. Nothing special so much sauce you couldn't see the veal. They did remove the filet from our check and offered dessert but by that time we were so aggravated we paid our bill and left. Nothing like it used to be with the exception of the restaurant itself. Lastly, they need to get some servers who speak English. Don't bother, go to CUT inside the Palazzo."
"1","The service wasn't very good. Multiple waiters kept coming to the table to get drink orders. None were particularly friendly . Then when we wanted to order couldn't get the server.  The food was just okay; nothing outstanding."
"2","Awesome company. I called them and they had someone out within the hour. Their technician had excellent customer service. Very fast and reliable.  Talked to me very clearly and made sure I understood everything in detail. Made me feel very comfortable. He was very knowledgeable. Answered all my questions and had my A.C. running strong again in a couple hours. I would recommend these people to anyone looking for a reputable quality company to get the job done right."
"2","My fridge was on the fritz in my place in Vegas, and I had to spend a whole week there this time for work, Clint came over promptly and fixed it immediately, I was able to stock it up immediately thanks to them. \nGreat Service, Reasonable Price, will use again."
"1","I used A&R Appliance Repair for many years and was satisfied. My house was going on the market so had them come for a few repairs. One burner on my Gas Cooktop would not ignite. The repair man proceeded to break the cook top and admitted that he caused the problem. He even said he would see if they had a comparable cook top to replace it with. A&R  instead paid for new parts to repair the cooktop. When the job was complete none of the burners worked. \n\nThe house sold and the stove did not pass inspection. Finally tired of the original making things worse I called for a supervisor. On July 17th a senior person came to the house and told my husband he didn't even need to go through the story of what happened because he had the weeks of paperwork. Once again it was explained that the final inspection coming up. All I needed was a working cooktop.\n\nI would call and yes I was frustrated answering the same questions and never getting the senior person on the phone again. The receptionists would always start the conversation asking how I knew the repairman broke the cooktop. Read the files so you know what was done every time he was in the house. And yes, I was angry. No one took responsibility for anything.\n\nA&R could not promise the cooktop would be in working condition before the final inspection. I threatened to take them to Small Claims Court more than once. With one week until the final inspection I was livid. Not cursing, just livid and certainly frustrated. I didn't get to talk to the supervisor, of course,  but was given his message. He said they would cancel the parts and I should take them to court. So I went out and bought a new cooktop so I could pass the inspection. \n\nA&R was totally incompetent in dealing with a situation they created. When it started I was a valued customer but since I would no longer require their services they decided they could treat me horribly. Remember this even if you are now a valued customer."
"1","I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \""THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\""  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \""Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\"".  That was his solution.  \n\nSo in a nutshell:\n1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\n2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  \n3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.  \n\nThis place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair."
"2","This is a great spot for breakfast off the strip.  It doesn't have much appeal, but it makes up for it with the food.  The Omelet House has the best banana nut bread hands down.  The omlets and other breakfast items are good, but you definitely need to eat here for the banana nut bread."
"2","3.5 stars, rounded up.\n\nMy family and I decided to escape from the touristy buffet scenes on the strip and wanted to find where the locals go to get their grub. It was around brunch time and found the Omelet House on my Yelp app, sounds good!\n\nThe ambiance had the homey feeling, with the picture frames and figurines on the wall. The chairs were sort of janky, but I didn't care. For the food, they have a large selection of entrees, especially for the omelettes. My parents ordered off the omelette menu and my brother had the $5.99 breakfast special. They also have other breakfast options if you're not an omelette fan like me. I ordered the huevos rancheros.\n\nThe food came out and wow, the omelettes my parents ordered were GINORMOUS! How many eggs do they use to make a serving? Looked like half a dozen. It also came along with potatoes that are sliced into coin shapes, such an interesting take on homefries. However, my brother $5.99 breakfast special looked so small, which my parents donated some of their omelette for him. My huevos rancheros was perfectly portioned and loved it. the tortilla chips were a great addition to scoop up the refried beans, salsa and runny egg yolk on the plate. My parents couldn't finish their omelettes even though they gave a portion to my brother. \n\nOverall, great hole-in-a-wall joint. Definitely recommend those who are bulking up on protein or just simply love eggs."
"2","Fantastic old-school wood-paneled breakfast spot in a shitty strip mall, staffed by motherly waitresses serving obesity-epidemic-fueling-sized portions of all the regular brekkie foods. \n\nOrder less than you think you'll need...trust me, it will be MORE than enough!\n\nThe only bummer with this place is it closes at 3pm...and who the hell is up and about before 3pm in Vegas?!?!?!"
"1","Not only was the food too greasy but they wouldn't accept our Entertainment coupon because they said it was a holiday which wasn't true. This was a Sunday, the day before Veteran's Day. I thought the point of such coupons was to build a customer base, not piss people off by making up weird rules and then quibbling about them. Never again Omelet House! Never again!"
"1","Holy cow. The worst coffee in, LV? The West? The country? For a breakfast spot?!?\n\nGot french toast. Two slices of white bread.\n\nCame with the home made cornbread - Ok, that's a star on it's own. It was inspirational. I now want to cook more cornbread, just thinking of it. \n\nThe service sucked that star away though. \n\nMy friend ordered some crazy lobster benedict, with, I wanna say, avocado? He said he was expecting it to be rich, and it was, but that he wasn't happy he ate it afterwards. \n\nInstead of home fries or hash browns, they insist you eat their crunchy fried chips. That was a fail."
"2","Review about this place were right, BIG portions! Off the strip but only about 10 minutes away from the end of the strip. We ordered the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, a pancake, and an omelette\nThe Corned Beef Hash came with potato crisps, very flavorful and tasted just baked, not soggy at all.\nI ordered the banana bread instead of toast, was pretty tasty! The servers were nice and attentive, only when we paid was there a wait, but no biggie to me.\nOverall, food was good and the price just as good."
"2","We enjoyed the omelettes, had the #7 and the #24 (can't remember the names) and they were both delicious. The portions are huge so come hungry or ready to share.  Omelets come with home made chips and banana or pumpkin bread which was moist and very tasty. The service was great and I will be back when I come back to Vegas looking for a breakfast spot"
"2","I was on my way to the Strip to do some gambling with my pal Stan Diego.  I needed something to eat before a long day of debauchery.\n\nHad a little trouble finding the place as the signage is somewhat misleading.  There were actually 4 or 5 cars idling in the parking lot waiting for the place to open.  Everyone made a rush for the door as soon as it was unlocked.  That has to be a good sign!\n\nIt's a quaint little diner - thought I was back in the Midwest for a second!!\n\nI went with the Kitchen Sink omelet and it was WAY too much food for even a large person to eat.  But it was quite good, so I made a valiant effort to get on the outside of this beast.  Couldn't do it, though.\n\nThe potato-chip like thingys accompanying the omelet were nothing special, but I didn't have room for them anyway.\n\nThe service was great - everyone was very friendly.\n\nRecommend."
"2","I ordered the lox omelet which was delicious the only downfall was how massive my plate was that I couldn't come close to finishing it. The potato spuds were amazing and the pumpkin bread to die for\nMy mom had the Greek omelet and she said it was really great"
"1","Im in Las Vegas for a few days and my husband and I decided to go somewhere for Breakfast.  Found this place near downtown. I had the corn beef hash which was quite good but the potatoes that came with it, were like having Home made potato chips, which is not exactly what I was looking to have for breakfast.  The place was very nice, very clean a little hard to find, if you missed the sign, you would miss it.  Not sure if we are in town again that we would go back."
"2","The omelette house as fantastic we had a very decadent breakfast including a lobster Benedict and stuffed french toast with cinnamon apple both were excellent I believe the chips are homemade and the service was great. This is a good place to go to get out of the casinos in have a good fresh breakfast"
"1","Wouldn't go back. It's a cool spot and all but it was too expensive for a dive bar. Maybe it was for the show but it felt overpriced for what the spot really is. Bartender was nice, got carded twice since they don't have security checking who comes into the place."
"2","My last night in Vegas on memorial day weekend I headed here with Tiny (Luke) and had a blast. Charles the bartender who made it clear that he only works Mondays and Tuesdays (he is sooooooooo cute...) treated us with such care that I am planning a trip back in July just to go say hi. Overall drinks were poured generously and the clientele was entertaining. Of course by the time we ordered our 3rd cocktail we were getting close to missing our flight and had to slam it and run back to our hotel to pick up our luggage. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the whole Flex scene but hopefully next time.  Would I go back ....oh hells yeah..."
"1","The reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars instead of 0-1 is because the drag show was pretty entertaining.The Bartenders are amazingly friendly and around 11 they have a $10 well all- you- can-drink-all-night special. Aside from that... WOW!!! \nHOLE IN THE WALL in a crusty neighborhood next to a strip mall. I wasn't expecting much after perusing the reviews left on Yelp but I really didn't expect to be walking into a smoke filled nightmare. funny thing was they actually had a VIP section. i'm kind of ranting here but it's because I can't wrap my brain around how horrible the place is. It's like going to a garage party when you were in High school but take away the hot guy you had a crush on and replace him with the 8th year senior that's at all the parties. \n\noh and i had to do laundry after because EVERYTHING i was wearing smelled like the carpet in the suncoast casino. Someone should turn the ventilation system on."
"1","After hearing so many good things about Naakiti, I was excited to use them for our Wedding Day. Unfortunately that was the worst decision I could've made. :( The flowers arrived looking wilted and poorly put together. What was supposed to be purple roses were a definite wilted and odd pink. The boys were not at all helped with their boutonnieres which were also poorly made and falling apart as they walked the aisle. My husbands \""maile lei\"" was not at all at maile lei. The spray arrangement we ordered for our archway was never put up, but instead places onto a table. To top it off it has taken me two months to finally speak to the owner Randi who argued about their policy instead of understanding the lack from her staff. The overall experience was very unprofessional and I would not recommend Naakiti florists to anyone looking for quality or even a little professionalism. Brides, stay far away!"
"2","Two words: giant donut.\n\nOrder one and you won't regret it. That's all I have to say."
"2","Ok, I said I would never review this shop, ever. Not because they're bad. The opposite is true. This place is a gem. I've been coming here for over five years. I too, am from Southern California. I wasn't recommended here. I was desperate for a haircut. I don't do salons. I drove until I saw the words barber. \n\nThe inside of this place is just buzzing. It's spacious and interesting. The owner was my first barber. I've tried several barbers since. I get the full barber treatment here. \n\nRecently, I noticed that Floyd Mayweather's training camp is located in the same plaza. I do recall driving around the rear of the plaza and noticing a RR Phantom. Thought it looked shady. Now I know who it belonged to. \n\nThis barber shop is about five minutes down the street from the Wynn and Palazzo. I recommend a taxi or driving. It's too far to walk from the strip. I'm going to Vegas this weekend for the Mayweather/Marquez fight. I'll be visiting Gerardo's like any other Vegas trip."
"2","I've been coming here for about 6 months now, every week and a half or so.  In the 7 or so years that I've lived here I've mainly gone to 4 different barber shops (depending on where I lived).  This place is interesting....  Never seen a place quite like it.  Typically when I've moved to a new city, I try to find a good \""ghetto\"" barber...  pardon the expression.  But typically the best barber shops are well....  not usually located in the best parts of town.  When I moved to vegas I did the same.... found MLK blvd and viola!  Good barber shops.  But that's too far a drive....\n\nAnyway, this place is good...  similar style to your typical predominantly black barber shop....  although everyone that works there is hispanic.  And it's located in the middle of China Town.  Haha...  They get a good mix of customers, mostly hispanic...  but not a big deal, they almost all speak english well enough (one guy I can think of doesn't).  I usually go early mornings and never really have to wait long... although later in the day they can get busy... and it's hard to tell who has appts. when you just walk in.  \n\nBottom line.... they're friendly enough, and do a pretty good fade.   That's all I need to know.   Oh, and cash only.... although I believe they have an ATM there."
"1","This barber shop has so much potential to be everything that it could be but it seems like something is missing. I've been coming here for over 6 years and the ambiance is good. It's got a carribean/Dominican/hispanic theme, not that they're trying to be it but almost all the barbers and customers are either Dominican, Cuban, or southamerican. I think this is pretty cool. Now to what this barber shop is lacking.. Customer service! I feel that everyone is treated like a number including myself who has been coming here for years. They're main objective seems to have as many cuts in a day as possible. Today was my final day at gerardos barber shop. Why? The owner Gerardo cut my hair and basically didn't follow my directions to my hair cut. He did it his own way outlining my directions. No customer satisfaction. I went to sport chalet immediately after to buy a hat cuase i was too embarrased to show my head. End of story."
"2","interesting place but they actually did a good job."
"2","Perfect Barbers! My sons have been to various shops in town over the years then we found an amazing barber we loved. Then he just got to busy and was impossible to book with. That's when I found this amazing Spanish barber shop in the heart of the city! Mesa is the best! Appointments are not required but if you have your head set on a certain barber I recommend it. If you want a certain style and you don't speak Spanish just bring a pic. They will get it every time. They have seen 5 different guys here always great! I AM PICKY too! Fades, tapers, etc Cuts are 15$ and fast without all of the barbershop ego! Doesn't matter what color you are they got ya! Tip em' I give them an extra 5$ on every cut because looking great makes my guys feel great!  Gracias al duro trabajo de estos chicos no amo esta tienda! no hablo espa\u00f1ol, as\u00ed ;-)"
"2","My barber is Marco, Always punctual! I love it, been going to him every week for 4 years now and i dont plan on changing. When I set appts hes always ready on time and makes me feel like a VIP. Ive went to other barbers if he was off or the 1 time he was out sick and they all do great"
"1","Even 1 star is a waste to this jerk ass company!!! We got their service around 1 month ago. The sales told us you pay $20 for the rental with 4 free bottle of water then you order at least 1 bottle every two weeks is fine. After the agreement signed up, here is water happened, the first week the put 3 bottles on the front door, second week 3 bottles, third week 2 bottles without asking! I called them to tell them we cant drink these much water. The man who answer the phone is such a mother fucker with an ass hole attitude! He told me that I am under the agreement of getting their water! Yes, I signed for 2 bottles a month, why the fuck on the earth you put 3 bottles every week without asking?! Then he tells me I need to call them every week if I want to skip a delivery!  You know what, I'm out of your fucking service. Take your damn equipment and get the fuck out of my house!!! I see there are other people also have problems when they cancel their service, I will see how is mine going!"
"2","My shower surround is gorgeous!!!"
"2","Small, medium, and large are definitely American-sized portions (9\"", 12\"", and 20\"", respectively). I had a small over the course of two meals. The large looked intimidating as the guys behind the counter were wrapping one up for a delivery order.\n\nWe visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had.\n\nEach sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette.\n\nThe verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10."
"2","About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum."
"2","Located just west of Las Vegas Blvd on Sahara near the Red Label Lounge, this Capriotti's location is easily accessible from the strip. The shopping plaza that it sits inside of might make you raise an eyebrow, but it's actually a pretty nice nice place inside and the staff is all all very friendly.\n\n They have vegetarian offerings on the menu that don't feel like a meat sandwich minus the meat (the vegetarian cheese steak is my favorite) so it's quickly become my favorite place to grab a quick bite for lunch."
"2","Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient.  The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!"
"2","Schneller, freundlicher Service. Preis/Leistung ist optimal. Guter Tipp f\u00fcr sub-fans."
"1","DO NOT COME HERE. This is the WORST Capriottis ever. The staff is completely incompetent. I have been here at least 3 times and every single time there has been an issue. 2 of the times I would be waiting for my sandwiches (15 mins) and then someone would come out and say that they messed it up and are remaking them (another 15 mins). The last time I ordered the woman literally repeated my order back 4 times. 4 TIMES. And they still messed it up. I gave this place a few tries but I will  never return to this Capriottis."
"2","This is the 2nd Capriotti's that I have visited. As always the food is 5-stars but I was disappointed that they only offer bottled soda. The location on Craig Rd has a soda fountain and you can get a refill on your drink at no charge. Their prices on chips and drinks is not worth it. The deserts are okay for the price. The staff are nice but the place looks a bit dumpy. Although, I must admit, I go in for the sandwiches and they are great so nothing else matters."
"1","The Salvation Army discriminates against people who aren't like them.  Did you know they spent $10 million dollars to try and prevent their organization from having to following anti-discrimination laws in hiring?"
"2","Our group of 8 had a very positive experience with this company. Our limo driver was early picking us up from the airport and was extremely friendly, there was decent, chilled champagne waiting for us, and they were again right on time to pick us up from the hotel at the end of our trip. Also, since we rented an Escalade SUV package for 8 people, it was very spacious and comfortable while still being a reasonable priced way to get to and from the airport. I would recommend it if you can get a good deal from their website."
"1","Up until this point I would only use Presidential limo but not anymore.  I booked them about a month in advance for pickup and dropp off in and escalade as well as limo service for one of the nights I was in town.  I called a couple days before to confirm the rate and the guy confirmed the rate I was quoted which was $53 for pickup and $48 for drop off.  A day before my trip I notice that something has drafted my credit card already so I call my credit card to find out that it was Presidential limo.  This was no problem with me at all but I was just confused because they had never done this before.  So I call to ask and they just tell me that was to confirm the reservation, I say no problem and the girl tells me the rate at which I am reserved for which is now $57 for pickup and $50 for dropoff.  So I tell the girl that I was originally quoted the lower price and even confirmed this price with someone a couple days before.  She goes on to tell me that the monthly price is changed because of fuel cost, so I ask when the last change was and she tells me it was in August.  I tell her thats funny because I paid the same price I was quoted for this reservation when I came to Vegas in the end of October.  After this she responds with \""uhhh ummm I don't know sir, all I know is that my shift just started at 4pm.\""  One of the most idiotic responses I ever got, I was nice and told her that I would forward her the email and she said she would have her manager look it over and give me a call.  So the next day I am waiting about an hour before my flight and still no call from the manager.  I call and talk to another girl and tell her the scenario, she says she is not sure why the rate is raised but will have the manager call me asap.  So this douchebag manager Jeff decides to call me while we our flying and leaves me a voicemail telling me that he is just going to go ahead and cancel our airport drop off and pick up.  He knew from our reservation when our flight time is and this a*****e called while we were flying.  When our flight landed I saw I had a voicemail and checked it to only become totally pissed off.  Jeff and Presidential limo do not know how to do business and when I called them back he was trying to give me attitude.  This guy seriously made the beginning of our trip so stressful and pissed me off so much with the voicemail and then having to talk to this incoherent moron.  I have never had any problems with the drivers at Presidential limo and I actually really enjoy them but because of the manager Jeff and his irresponsible business practices I will no longer use them and tell all my friends the same.  If you are quoted a price and have an email with that quoted price then you should pay that price, and if for some reason the price is a little higher someone should have a viable explanation as to why, not \""uhhh ummm all I know is my shift started at 4pm!\"""
"2","Great Service. We used them three different times. Always on time or early....thats a big plus in my book! They also sang happy birthday to me and gave me a rose. It was a nice touch to our special evening. We are going to use them again for our pick up and drop off at the airport. The taxi lines were super long. Limo is the way to go!"
"1","I've been putting this review off for way too long, so let's just go ahead and bite the bullet. I hate giving places bad reviews and bringing down their average, but I used Presidential for my wedding and shit was NOT okay. \n\nDad was paying for limos to take everyone from the wedding venue to dinner, and we booked several of them for 1 hour (it should take 15 minutes to get from one place to the other). I figured that by booking 1 hour, we (the girls) would have time to have our limo swing by the hotel to ditch the bouquets, guest book, and my giant train and veil. \n\nAfter the ceremony, the limos were supposed to arrive at the venue at 8:15. 8:25 came and went, and I had to get on the phone with the company. The company called dispatch and said the limos were almost there. Kfine, 10 minutes isn't bad. Weellll...8:40 came and went, and I was on the phone again. The operator told me that limos were already there and had been there for a while. \n\nWhat? Where? I was standing at the front of the venue doors, and there wasn't a limo in sight. \n\n\""Well, the drivers said that they're right in front of the venue.\""\n\nAt this point, I was confused. Very confused. And stressed. Because it was my wedding day. And there weren't any limos in sight! And guests were hungry. And I was hungry. And did y'all (the limo company) even have the right address? \n\nThen I heard one of my bridesmaids yell, \""Hey Ann! The limos are in the BACK!\""\n\nTHE BACK. Great. Thanks for the communication (or lack of), guys. By that point, it was close to 9pm. We didn't have time to drop anything off, and we ended up paying for the full hour. \n\n2 stars for the friendly drivers and the bottle of champagne in each limo. But seriously, 1/3 of a glass of bubbly for each passenger ain't gonna fix this one."
"1","I went to Dr. Garcia's office to get a tatoo removed. It was $100 for fifteen minutes. I was only there about 5 minutes, but you have to pay in 15 minute blocks.\n\nSo I get the laser treatment and it just felt like getting a tattoo, not a big deal. I don't know why everyone complains about the laser removal like they are getting their skin burned off, It really does not hurt.\n\nAnyways, here is the deal. One treatment, tattoo still as dark as ever. It did not fade one bit and it has been almost four weeks. I was told black ink was the easiest to get removed. During the consult Dr. Garcia said he was not sure about how many treatments, but he said it would fade each treatment. It did not fade at all.\n\nI am going back for one more treatment to be sure. If it starts to fade the tattoo then I will continue the treatments and update my review. If it does not start to fade then I guess I am out $200. I would really like this tattoo to be removed and to give this place five stars. I hope the next treatment works."
"2","I only went in to buy a few fish the other day, but the two ladies who were working in the aquarium area were so helpful its my new favorite fish place. They explained what fish would be best for my biTube, introduced me to a nice snail to clean my tank, and overall just made the experience very nice, quick and satisfying. I'll be going back for sure.\n\nBased on the other reviews, not sure I'd ever bring my dogs in there, and if they do actually sell dogs and cats that's very bad mojo. However, for fish, its a-ok."
"2","i love Petsmart!  best pet store.  big, bright, and easy to navigate!  this one is located right next to Walmart...and the only negative is this shopping complex...very hard to get on and off Charleston or Decatur."
"2","A series of controversial reviews made me hesitate about this place in the beginning but I'm happy that I decided to check it for myself. The food was excellent, the price was reasonable and the restaurant was clean and elegant. I loved the Koobideh which is by far the best I've had in the Persian restaurants in the States.  Definitely will go again at my next trip to Vegas."
"1","The $6.49 linch lured is in...The chicken in the sweet and sour chicken was bad. As in not good for human consumption at this point. The coconut chicken although cheaper than the usual coconut shrimp was yummy. Fried rice was good. Egg rolls were beyond horrible & no duck sauce. Service was poor since we never got a refill until after we got our check and still had to ask for it. Nothing remarkable beyond the price."
"1","Awful customer service.  Went in with my brother and his sons looking for a pocket knife for my nephew who is in the boy scouts.  When we entered some guy who looks like he's been on meth for the last ten years asked us what we were looking for.  When we told him we were looking to buy my nephew his first knife for scouts, he proceeded to bad mouth the scouts in front of my nephew, calling them \""pussies.\""  ...classy... When i asked to look at some drop point knives, my brother (who isn't all that knife savvy) asked the guy what that meant.  He then told my brother that it meant the blade was shaped like a spear.  ... The guy works in a knife shop and doesn't know the difference between a drop point and a spear point???  The whole experience was pretty much like that.  We'd ask a question and Mr. Crackhead counter boy would give us an incorrect answer as rudely as he possibly could.\n\nI will concede that they do have a decent selection of knives, including benchmade, al mar and spyderco. But their prices are way high.  You could probably save 25-50% buying online and have the added benefit of not having to go through the whole ghetto experience.\n\nSo, unless you're willing to pay exorbitant prices because you can't wait and you like dealing with someone who has no idea of what he's talking about, stay away."
"2","This Roberto's s pretty much the same as all other Roberto's.  But, they have free hot carrots, radish, and cucumber at their salsa bar.  Yum!\n\n$2.50 will get you a bean and cheese burrito that will fill you up.  For Vegas, that is an excellent value.  If you're in the area, try it."
"1","Miserable staff that works there. No thank yous for shopping at the store. Will never be back."
"1","I wanted to purchase my usual foot pumice and topcoat.  I only had a $100 bill and three $1 bills.  The pink haired cashier looked at me with no expression and said \""we don't have change\"" with no offer of help to the change situation.  I told her well I guess I won't be making a purchase today.  Then she tells me I can get change at the bar around the corner.  Really?  Sally's don't take cash?  Sally's employees are always rude with an exception once in a while.  Horrible!  I will spend the extra money and go to Ulta where I'm sure my $100 will be excepted!  Boo Sally!"
"2","Saturday  was a good day to stop in on the way home from work. \nSince they no longer are involved in the Greenland Grocery food court. \nGina and the kid's are back at the original location. I love it ! \nWe had the Fried mandu, Dol sot Bi Bim Bap, Bi Bim Kook Soo (this is the only place in Vegas that I know of to get this). The best food each and every time I come here. I am glad that Russell gets a day off, but I miss \""talking story\"" with him. just have to go during the week. You want Korean/Hawaiian plate lunch this is the place to go. Food is authentic, service can't be beat. Boiled peanuts are addictive. So lucky to have a go to place."
"2","Hubby and I were so incredibly happy when we saw that there's a place on the Mainland that has Meat Jun.  We were so excited to try it out and this place did not disappoint.  The Meat Jun is just as good as in Oahu.  For those that don't know, meat jun, is Korean BBQ marinated meat that's dipped in egg batter and then cooked.  It might sound weird but it's so good.  We also tried the BBQ chicken and the short ribs and both were great.  Service was super friendly.  Get that aloha vibe.  Made me miss Hawaii so much.  They served the typical Korean side dishes but they also served sliced up sauteed hot dog and onion and I've never seen that before but it just hit the spot.  So simple and so good.  I think we'll be coming here every time we're in Vegas for our Meat Jun-fix."
"2","The food was pretty good, but come armed with lots of patience, because they are very slow to fill your order.\nThe price was right and one full star goes to the cute friendly waiter that gave us a hug, Cheers!"
"2","This is our favorite restaurant for Korean food.  Prices are excellent especially when compared to other options for Korean.  We always get the spicy seafood soup very good and generous seafood portions.  Another favorite is the Stone Pot Bibimbop, perfect amount of flavor and excellent texture in the crunchy rice.  The side dishes are also amazing.  Service is always quick and friendly.  Decor leaves much to be desired, but we go for the food.  I highly recommend this restaurant."
"1","Even though they have some interesting stuff in store, the service is lacking severely. Next door to Savers, we came in looking for remote helicopters. The owner had to bitch at his teenage son to get him to come help us. We come back to next day to purchase one and he tells us after it has rung up that there is a sale on helicopters that day. \n\nWell gee, I would have liked to have know that before so perhaps I could have picked out a better, more expensive model. He didn't really offer any info on anything but just kept flying that helicopter all over the store. Just really bad immature service and their selection is not the most extensive I have seen, but I was really interested in the items they offered in the store."
"1","Disclaimer: My visit to Wally's was about three years ago, maybe things are better now. \n\nThis was the first time I had EVER taken one of my vehicles to a shop for anything other than an oil change, tires, or smog check. I do all my own work and well, for me, this was similar to dropping your child off at day care for the first time. I chose Wally's because I figured it would be cheaper than the dealer. \n\nMy car had an erratic idle during warm up, I did some of my own diagnostic work and narrowed it down to a few different things but I decided I didn't want to throw parts at it and surly Wally's could handle this situation. \n\nI dropped my car off and one of Wally's staff drove me back to work, I appreciated that. \n\nI got a call the next day and they said the car was ready to go. The bill was $500. Okay, a little more than I wanted to spend but at least it's running properly now....NOT! Whatever they did made the problem worse!!! how on earth could they tell me it was better?, that's beyond me. \n\nI took the car back, got another ride back to work, and this time they figured it out. Bad idle air control valve. Okay good this was one of the things that I thought might have been bad so at least we agree on that. \n\nSo not too excited that I had to take it there twice. But here's what really roasted my muffins. A few months ago I was looking through a Honda Accord chat forum and apparently this problem is extremely prevalent in these cars. These guys only work on Hondas and Acuras, why aren't they familiar with this problem? So in the end I feel like was probably overcharged for shop time considering that this should have been an easy fix for them. \n\nSix and twelve months later Wally's called my cell phone (Hey I'm on the 400 minutes a month plan, quite wasting my minutes!) to \""remind\"" me to come in for maintenance. Ugh I know when I need to do these things and I'm not coming back here to have them done. \n\nSo why the two stars? Well I really did appreciate the rides back to work and at the end of the day they never tried to up sell me on further repairs that I didn't need, but I don't think I'll go back there."
"1","While the food was good it was disturbing to find an ANT in my drink!  All the restaurants I have ever had an issue of some sort a manager came and apologized, here I got no response at all.  I wasn't looking for a free meal just some concern about the ant that somehow got into my drink."
"1","The guys at 1day are courteous enough just not very professional at running a business.  They are very disorganized, can't keep appointments they schedule, lose many parts, etc. They do the job but don't take care of the details like leaving over spray everywhere, scratching up the trim and glass, and again...lose more parts.  It will take about 5x longer than they tell you to get it done.\nDefinitely would not recommend One day Paint & Body."
"1","I stop by with my car to have the estimate on my bumper and at first they said, they just only going to charge $100 to adjust it. Guess what? The next day when I pick it up, it hasnt been done and it looks like it wasnt even touched. They said I need a new bumper a bumper bar and the whole thing will now cost me $1500.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my car, there is another customer who was yelling at them for not keeping their promise. The guy has hitched a bus across town only to find that his car only in primer and not even painted yet. I am not gonna leave my car here. \n\nI took it somewhere else and get it done the right way. Think again, about leaving your car here."
"2","The prices are better than some of the other boba joints around and they offer some different stuff on their menu.  I sometimes opt for the smoothies w/ boba in them and they're fruity and refreshing....kinda like old Wham! songs.  You can also opt for less sugar in your drink which is nice too!"
"2","It is like any other good boba place.  The atmosphere/ environment is nice and calm.  I had the boba milk tea and expected the taste.  The boba was good as well as the milk tea.  Its good, definitely a nice place to hang out.  It is also in the shopping center so it has a nice location.  Monkey man! haha\n\nUnfortunately, some of the seats were kind of dirty as well as the table but I am sure they were going to clean them soon.  \n\nI gave it four stars instead of 5 because the workers seemed a bit rude and the chair was dirty.  Doesn't truly stand out as the best but its a tea place alright."
"2","I come here all the time!!\n\nI usually get almond milk tea w/boba or regular milk tea w/boba. When in season, I get fresh watermelon w/boba. They know how to cook the boba here. It's soft and all they they way through. \n\nThey serve some snacks but I haven't tried any yet. There are some tables so you can kick it if you want. I think there are some seats outside as well. \n\nThe drinks come out fast even when there is a line!"
"1","We went here last night to get a late night snack. \n\nI ordered the shrimp balls. I didn't care for them. They were like a shrimp sausage meatball. I was hoping for more like whole shrimp. They were probably made the traditional way, so they may be good to people who are expecting that. But I didn't care for the texture nor the flavor. The dipping sauce was pretty good though.\n\nMy wife ordered the red bean shaved ice. It was okay. The flavor was decent and reminded me of red beans and rice. I'm not a fan of tapioca pearls though. I don't like the consistency. Again, it was probably made traditionally and may be enjoyable if that's what you liker expecting. But it's just not my thing. I'm kind of weird about consistency.\n\nWhile I'm not giving a great rating, it's based more on my personal preferences. I wouldn't dissuade people from going there if they like boba drinks. Just not my thing."
"2","THIS PLACE IS FLAT OUT, POINT BLANK, NO CONTEST, the best Bobba drink house in Nevada PERIOD! i have been drinking the black tapioca balls drink since i was 16 and now im 29 and i have had hundreds everywhere. Not only is it the cheapest place in town with a regular bobba being under 2.50 but the quality of the tea and the well prepared Bobba balls are cooked perfect. I really hate when people write comments like the balls were not cooked right when they had them in a frozen drink. When you have these cooked tapioca balls in a frozen drink you jepordize their quality. I would say get their standard milk tea with bobba and you will see the quality im talking about. This place only takes cash but they are fast VERRY clean and most of all verry good!"
"1","Got a large passion fruit smoothie with boba. this is my usually favor whenever I go to a Boba place. this was filled with SUGAR. No flavor whatsoever. Its merely disgusting.  I could barely finish a fourth of the large so I threw it away after I realize that forcing myself to drink a 4$ drink worth of watered sugar is not worth my health."
"2","Came here on a late night for some drinks. The durian and passion fruit smoothies are delicious! Highly recommend! While you're waiting in line or for your drinks - there's plenty of K-pop posters for you to fangurl and gawk at (if that's your style)."
"2","the best thing about ronald's is that you can tell that each donut was made individually and not on some conveyor belt a la krispy kreme. as for the donuts (vegan donuts?!), they are ridiculously good - not too sweet, not too dry but soft and chewy like a great donut should be."
"2","I discovered this oasis in the desert through a friend and make it a point to stop whenever i'm in Vegas. Super tasty and not overpriced. For some reason, a vegan donut shop is difficult to find in Southern California. I thought about having a dozen shipped every month, but it's more fun to experience their delicious donuts in person."
"2","One vegan choice after another. Ronald, I love you. I had a delicious and enormous apple fritter. We filled a big box to go. I'm one happy vegan!"
"1","Ok -I think my taste buds may be way off on this one but I hadn't eaten a donut since I was a kid. \n\nI got several Ronald's donuts and they just didn't taste like much. They also seemed so greasy It reminded me of fried chicken in a way. \n\nWeird, I know. After eating healthy for so long maybe my taste for crap is just unreliable now. Which makes me kinda happy cuz I don't crave it but kinda sad cuz I remember donuts as being so good. \n*confused* \n\nPS: The counter help was really nice and prompt"
"2","Came here this past weekend to pick up some donuts before heading back to the OC.  Got there about an hour before they closed so we knew we would be limited to selection.\n\nThe place was quiet and clean.  We picked up a dozen of their donut holes, an apple fritter, and an apple filled tostada looking pastry.  it was pretty cheap too!!\n\nThe donut holes tasted fresh.  The apple fritter was huge but full of sugar to me.  The apple filled tostada was the best..it was not too sweet and had good amount of apples in it.\n\nA great place to get a deal if you like donuts."
"2","I just had these today and omigosh! They were sooooo good! I had a chocolate twist, which was huge, I had to share it with my co-worker. I also had a jelly donut and 10 donut holes (I got for another co-worker) and I only spent $3.50! That's such a good deal. I can't even tell they're vegan! Such a great selection."
"1","I have to disagree with everyone else about this place. I called to order a plain cheese pizza for delivery, the guy who took my order told me my pizza will be delivered in 45mins. So I waited and waited, waited some more. As I seen the time has gone by it's been 1 hour and my food isn't still here. So I called them to see where has my pizza taken place at! They said it's on it's way. So I waited again til finally after waiting for almost 2 hours for a pizza delivery I finally got my pizza. And it was cold. The chocolate eclair they gave me was old. I was very disappointed. So I DO NOT recommend ANYONE to order from this place. They Suck at delivery."
"2","What a great place.  Everyone was friendly.  The food was delicious.  Dinner for five and a child with drinks about $275.  The chef put on quite a show for us."
"1","I only go to this place if I'm hungry with no options. Even when I paid to get an upgraded sandwich with the promise of more meat, it was anything but. Two slices of turkey, hardly any avocado , and a heap of lettuce. No thanks. I'll just drive to Subway and get a $5 foot long."
"1","What a mistake.soooooo disappointing. I decided to go inside to order & it looks like these people are actually living here. The kids wee running around , their bicycles parked in the corner, the TV blaring something on Cartoon Network and the people in the kitchen just laughing and playing around. I ordered the Beef & Broccoli combo, fried won tons and wor won ton soup. It came pretty quickly but once I got it home and tore into it it was just plain awful, the egg roll tasted like it was made of spoiled cabbage, the beef was thin & slimy very rubbery and I never even tried the broccoli or rice. The Wor Won ton soup was hot but everything was overcooked, the shrimp were tough & rubbery, the pork was missing, and the won tons were not cooked all the way too. The only thing good here was the sweet & sour sauce I dipped my fried won tons into. I would not go back here, Chinese fast-food should not be this bad."
"2","Quite possibly the BEST pancakes I've ever had.  Not a huge obscene size, but a normal looking pancake that knocks your socks off!  We had other food there, but nothing even close to the pancakes!  Go there, order pancakes and be amazed :)"
"1","Blueberry Hill serves up completely average diner food.  It has it's purpose, though, and it makes great late-night or hangover food.  My chorizo \""omelet\"" came out as more of a scramble, and only tasted \""OK\"".  If you're looking for a local, family-owned alternative to IHOP that's still open 24 hours, this is your place.  It's a strange little restaurant, layout-wise, but on the plus side, they do have booths for odd numbered groups of 3, 5, etc...  The service was honestly just bad.  We rotated between 2 different waiters, and neither of them really paid us much attention.  To top off the misery, the guy at the cash register was one of the most pessimistic people I've encountered.  When my friend's credit card wouldn't swipe on the first try, he grumbled, \""At lest you *have* credit... Most people in the country don't!\""  Nice...  Blueberry Hill will serve in a pinch, but there have got to be better local 24 hour food options in Vegas..."
"2","ABSOLUTELY THE BEST OLD FASHIONED PANCAKES IN LAS VEGAS! (maybe the world). \nThe Good:\n1. Extremely Friendly Staff make you think you are living in a small town.\n2. Huge Menu of great tasting food.\n3. Reasonable Prices and Great Daily Specials!\n4. Open 24 hour (yes in a row too).\n\nThe Bad:\n1. It is a diner, so not a pristine place.\n\nRecommend you take guests from out of town to this favorite of mine. You cannot go wrong here!"
"2","Father's day brunch for family of 6 and service was great. \n\nI guess we had arrive early enough to beat the crowd.  \n\nAwesome Sunday ! ! !"
"1","I was visiting from out of town and wanted to test with an agency while I was staying in Vegas. The one model I booked cancelled the day before our after having scheduled it weeks in advance. Apparently she didn't realize when her flight out of town was. \n\nThe other two models the agent sent me never responded to my numerous emails. The agent then said he would book someone else and he never got back to me either. \n\nUnprofessional and a complete waste of time."
"1","Wow, I really liked the folks here, and they did pack my item well. However, the international shipment I was sending was based on size and not weight, the box they chose would have cost me and extra 250.00 in shipping had I not taken the package home cut the box down and repacked it."
"1","I do not recommend this place! I purchased groupon for the gel manicure and pedicure. I was defintely not satisfied. It was not worth the drive. In plus, they charged an extra five dollars for shellac, opi and other high quality nail polishes. That's ridiculous. On top of that, the pedicure sucks!"
"1","I was really unhappy with the service. I came here because I read the good reviews on yelp, but now I know not to go to the first place I click on with good reviews. From the moment I walked in they weren't friendly, and the communication was horrible. Every question I asked & request was not understood. The fill took way longer than necessary. I was charged $5 more for gel when I asked for regular polish..just overall an unhappy experience."
"1","I tried this place for the first time today with a friend. The place was clean and the staff was ok. I wouldn't really say friendly because they barely spoke with us. The regular manicure was $12  which was ok, and they charged my friend $35 for the gel manicure. You had to spend at least $15 to pay with your credit card. The service was ok. She cleaned my nails ok and cleared them out. When she put the nail polish I didn't notice anything wrong but after the nail polish dried up bubbles started to come out in all of my nails. By the time I was in my car all of my nails had this little bubbles coming of the polish. Not sure if they are thinning the opi nail polish with something but definetly not good quality. My friend choose a marron tone for the gel polish and it ended up looking nude. Definetly not coming back. If you want something fast at an ok price then go here but don't expect quality."
"1","This is the second time I have had bad service and the second time leaving a bad review. I called the office to inquire about their travel services. I got a voicemail of course. I was contacted later that evening and she told me that if I was purchasing airline tickets that there is a $40 charge! I said \""well, just another reason to be dissatisfied with your services\"". She replied \""it's not us, it's the airlines\"". Then hung up on me. No goodbye or anything! WOW great customer service!! I think it's about time for a refund for what I was ripped off with this membership!! Absolutely NO stars!!!"
"2","I've never actually personally met the guys at A-Dependable Insurance but have been with them for a few years now. Price was great especially knowing that they're working with multiple companies to see who can get the best rate for you. I've been with Progressive ever since through A-Dependable and whenever I have questions about ANYTHING...I'll call them and they not only answer my questions, but they usually go about taking care of anything that needs to get done. It's nice to have someone who actually does care. I'm not exaggerating either. Good guys and good company. I recommend just giving them a call and seeing what they can do for you. I can't imagine going anywhere else now."
"2","I have been using A-Dependable for about 6 years now.  There simply are no better agents that Ken and Devin.  Top-notch service at an instant.  They ALWAYS make sure I am properly covered and with the best value carrier available.  I dont even have to ask, they just make recommendations each year and have lowered my premium several times.  Very refreshing!"
"2","So my boyfriend and I enter and the hostess takes us to a table because there are no booths but it was too cold for me and my bf so she said where ever we would like I sat by the sun for warmth but then I saw a booth became open we moved. In the bathroom its very nice it was messy and very cold also the mechanism sensor of the water flow didn't work very well and the machine where you have to manually take the napkins out. Didn't work so I came out asking for napkins of course they were very apologetic we sat at a booth with Tammie when she came over there were no menus nor was the table clean because we have moved but they quickly set it up . Tammie was amazing had a great smile always and tried to upgrade us but in a casual way where I didn't feel pressure we asked her opinion on dessert and she gave it to us.she asked us for refills and was very on top of her service. Definitely would come back for the service we love TGIF and it's a routine for us .My bf and I have never been to this one and we will be coming back. the only downfall...the bathrooms:( boo"
"1","We arrived at the restaurant during early evening on a Thursday.  There were only two other customers at the time sitting at a corner table.  The female at that table was having an extrememly loud cell phone conversation that we were not interested in. We stood at the entrance for a minute. No one greeted us.  Two Asian males were just sitting at the bar chatting, not paying attention to us.  One had an apron on with the nametag \""BAI\"".  The other one just read a newspaper at the bar.  So I began to walk over and get a menu from the shelf at the rear of the the two males.  \n\nI was interested in some spicy Szechuan cuisine. The other two in my party wanted something not so spicy.  The female in our group asked if everything was spicy.  Bai finally interupted us and stated with a sarcastic glare, \""the one with the chili (icon) is hot!\""\n\nWe agreed to eat here and told Bai that there were three of us dining.  Bai immediately attempted to sit us at a small table adjacent to the the loud lady on the cell phone.  I gestured to the larger table and Bai asked,\"" how many?\""  We said, \""Three\"".  Bai gestured us away from the larger round table, towards the smaller table adjacent to the loud female on the cell phone again.  Bai stated,\""you have three, three sit here!\""\n\nThere were maybe 30-40 EMPTY tables in the entire restaurant and he refused to have us sit anywhere but near the loud lady.  We finally told him that we would like the larger table to make room for the many dishes we were going to try.\n\nBai became disgruntled and we sat at the larger table.  As we were looking at the menu items, I noticed that Bai had walked towards the bar and muttered something to his Asian friend\n reading the newspaper.  Bai then turned around and glared at us.\n\nI finally had had it and decided that a sour attitude would probably be present during the entire meal.  I wish I had read the YELPS on this restaurant prior to considering it.\n\nI stood up and stated to my friends that it would be of best interest if we departed now since we felt uncomfortable by the ungracious staff.\n\nI should have also noticed that no one was breaking the door down attempting to dine in this awful place.\n\nAll three of us are Asian, so I don't think there was any unpleasantries due to race.\n\nWe ended up next door at the Capitol Seafood Restaurant where we were pleasantly greeted and respected during the entire meal.  We were even given free desserts, which no one else received that we noticed.\n\nWe should have waved a $100 bill at Bai as we passed leaving the area, because that is what he lost his restaurant that evening, not to mention this AWESOME review."
"2","I came here for Taiwanese style breakfast and I thought everything was good. \n\nThe space is on the second floor of the strip mall in Chinatown. The ambiance is your typical Chinese place. Not dirty, not immaculate, Asian style decor, well lit, small and large tables. \n\nWe ordered the fried dough with soy milk for dipping, the roasted peanuts and anchovies which normally goes with congee but we ate it straight as a snack, the rice ball, egg crepe and soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were average but the other items were good and satisfied my craving. \n\nTrue, their tabletop chili oil is not as hot but I've been told that's the Taiwanese style and I believe there is beauty in every hot sauce. \n\nThe service was lacking but not horrible. They only had two servers staffed so they did what they could and at least brought the food out promptly. You don't go to Asian restaurants for their smiling service. It's efficient and to the point."
"1","This the the most expensive Chinese breakfast restaurant. We have 4 people and we spend about $70 dollars. I was shocked when I see the check. We only ordered about 5 small things including milk and Chinese donuts and the Chinese small steam dumplings which they are already dried inside without any juices and so tasteless."
"1","Ordered over 10 items on both the breakfast menu and the Szechuan menu. First of all, their steam buns were ready-made and re-steamed when we ordered, so taste like shui Mai.... Omg and everything comes afterwards are either too salty or tasteless.\n\nOMG this is one of the worst Chinese food I've ever has in my life."
"1","This place is getting worse every time I come here. They now started adding in gratuity even though there is a party of 2. They add it too even if your order is take out. Total fucking bullshit. \n\nThe service is horrible. The girl working there looks like a fucking bitch who doesn't seem to want to be there so I wasn't happy that I had to pay a higher gratuity then what I would have given.\n\nBe warned!\n\nUpdate: My mom called later to complain (same lady that took care of us and added in the gratuity)....and the lady said, next time let me know that you are local and I will not add in gratuity...uhhh what?!? I didn't realize tipping was \""required\"" now. You should be lucky if you get tipped for such horrible attitude/service!"
"1","The only good thing here is the hot soy milk. But the soy milk was room temp today. Service wasn't so great. Waitress sorta kept ignoring us. The plates and utensils were dirty. Again, try to come here for breakfast only for the soy milk."
"1","For Taiwanese style of breakfast.  The  seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone.  Disappointed!"
"2","See Richard, my important piece of advice. He is not the eye doctor but he guided me through my out-of-state benefit coverage when my insurance is about to expire, and took the extra time to check and compare my old prescription glasses to my new one, and eventually discovered that the former helped me see better so i had to be refracted and tested again by the clinic's two doctors. This is the type of customer service that earns a customer, and with that, i highly recommends their services."
"1","I went here after a suggestion from one of the local Chinese bakery workers.  I don't know if it was what we ordered but I didn't care for the food.\n\nI ordered Kung Pao Chicken and my friend ordered Cashew Chicken.  The Cashew Chicken was tasteless with a bland sauce, Kung Pao had flavor in the sauce with a bit of a kick but not a memorable experience.  \n\nThe pork fried rice was decent for lunch special but not amazing in any sense of the word.  One plus of the take out of this place is that they will give you the soup to go.  The soup was very tasty it was a corn based egg drop soup.\n\nI don't know why a native speaker would send me here but I probably wouldn't go back too quickly."
"2","LOVE their Rosy Duck. TIP: appetizer portion if 8.99, half duck is 9.99...it is much larger and worth the $1. We get the duck everytime we go.\n\nLunch menu is decent. For 6.99 or so you get a drink, eggroll, soup, wonton, entree, and fried rice. The entree I had (beef and green pepper) wasn't exciting or that great, but I felt it was a good value. \n\nHouse crispy chicken is also amazing.. I will say the house chicken and rosy duck are v. similar, so only order one or the other depending on your particular poultry craving that day."
"1","If you go to a Chinese restaurant to eat make sure you see at least 10 Chinese people eating not standing around watching TV.  If you don't see them run. One of Funniest things I ever heard in my life the owner or maybe not was talking to a couple next to our table saying I require my staff to speak English. Really?  I asked for a jack and coke what came to the table was regular coke. I asked the server what's up? He said we don't have that. I said take the coke away he gave to the couple sitting next to us.  Joyful house! Our shrimp in lobster sauce came out with canned mushrooms strange.  My wife Asian was laughing. She said check out your fork I think they used that one to fix the drain in the kitchen seems the forks and spoons have been there sense 1980's it wouldn't be so bad if the food was really fantastic. Costco has GREAT deals on quality table wear on MLK (TIP OF THE DAY) I asked the server what is in the dumplings he said chicken. I asked if they had shrimp of pork dumpling he said you can go up the street if you want that. OMG! I said we will try the dumplings how many do you get ?  He said 5 - I said r u sure the menu says 6. He said 5 only. Ok served 6.  Keep in mind we went in early before 5pm to check this place out. I was here 12 yrs ago and it was pretty good. How many signs do you need that say vote #1 in the 2011 RJ readers poll inside your restaurant? I think I counted 6 big ones and a CNN international one blocking the front door.  Don't believe everything u read. It's  Dec21st we are all still alive and the food is below average. RJ readers poll is rigged.  Look I have been to Asian restaurants around the world this place is NOT in the top 100.  Maybe the real employee's are on vacation?  Hmmmmm..."
"1","Guys, WTF?  Ate here because of the great reviews on yelp.  Ended up throwing away basically all of our food.  The meats were all chewy and grossly over-battered.  It was highly disgusting and mostly inedible.  I blame yelp for wasting my boyfriends $40 and calories on this crap."
"2","Last trip to Vegas, I stopped by here to get some goodies (milk bun, pineapple shortbread, taro bun, etc.) I've never been much for the savory goodies, so I can't speak to them...But for the sweet stuff, this place hits the mark. I loved what I bought so much that I returned the next day for more! Good breakfast foods. The place is nice and clean inside and the selection very good.."
"1","I only like one drink here, but it's enough for me to come in occasionally.  I love their green milk tea, other than that I am not a fan of the drinks here.  The fruit drinks aren't made of real fruits and sometimes they taste powdery.\n\nAs for the food, there is only 2 things I like.  The taiwanese sausage ( I don't know where else to get this in Vegas) and the spiced pork chop plate is a pretty good price for lunch.\n\nI don't like going at night though because that's when all the young teenagers come out...and I hate the smokers too.  I wish lung cancer on all of them.  :oP"
"1","This is Las Vegas' version of Tea Station I guess.  The sign said \""Tea Planet\"" but everything inside had the Tea Station logo.\n\nI think it's in the Tea Station employee hand book that the servers are supposed to be rude.  We got the same crappy service in Vegas that we would normally get in the San Diego and Los Angeles locations.\n\nOur drinks took a long time to come out (the place was not packed).   We ordered green tea, green milk tea, and peppermint milk tea - they were good though, they tasted the same and the boba had the same consistency as the other locations.    \n\nTheir spicy chicken wings were pretty good, I would have to say better than the San Diego locations.\n\nThis location gets 2 stars because of the bad customer service and the lengthy time it took us to get our drinks."
"1","This place has completely horrible service. They come to your table about a minute after you sit down, and if you aren't ready to order - they won't come back for another 10 minutes, unless you can somehow flag one of them down [ but they usually pretend not to see you].\n\nTheir drinks are mediocre at best. And they don't seem to cook their boba on a consistent basis. They also have a minimum purchase amount for each person at the table. And you get charged a two dollar fee if you don't meet it.\n\nThe only reason I really go here, is because it's one of the only places in town where you can get boba after 9. Other than that, I wouldn't waste my time."
"2","Seem like a great place to hang out and talk with a group of friend.\nI'm a tea lover and they have a great variety of tea available. Wish I can try them all. \nI usually order the green apple tea."
"1","i use to think that there is no other place other than tea station. despite their horrible service, i still continued to buy my tea there. One day, i just couldnt stand it anymore, they had new people working and twice they made my drink wrong. when i have to pay $6 for my boba, it better be my money's worth. i have been ordering the wintermelon milk tea for 2 years and they now tell me that the drink does not exist. they poured milk into the wintermelon green tea that they mistakenly made for me. Of course it did not taste they way it was suppose to. i complained and they did not want to replace my drink until i got a bit furious with them. they ended up just making me a milk tea, which was delicious but i did not enjoy it, just for the fact that i initially wanted my wintermelon milk tea and what they put me through, just for a simple drink."
"1","Love the matcha green tea with boba and the sweet buttered toast is good too.  But It's a little over priced, and they could use some new staff cause the women waitresses were just rude and unhelpful."
"1","This is a place for a certain type of person. This type of person must not care about service, blood sugar levels, comfort, or feeling welcome in general. Let me explain.\n\nService - there is no service.\n\nBlood sugar levels - I'm sorry, you have diabeetus. They empty one bag of sugar per drink, I'm pretty sure.\n\nComfort - ok, I'm not asking for lavish cushions, but isn't it time to get some better chairs and cushions that aren't worn, and worn, and worn again?\n\nAre you welcome? Meh. Maybe. Not if you stay longer than 45 minutes. Especially if you have a bunch of people with you.\n\nI will say this to their credit - they have a large menu of drinks, some items you can only get from them. That's cool I guess. Too bad everything else sucks. But you can avoid most of those things by just getting your drink to go. Just maybe tell them easy on the sugar bags."
"1","I'll start by saying we didn't eat here, we just wanted refreshments on a hot day!  The place is cute, clean and I would've thought about going back to have something to eat if ever in the area.  \n\nBut, their service is horrible - absolutely rude and condescending.  If you are able to make out what they are saying . . . I don't speak Chinese so perhaps that's on me, but I didn't realize that's what it took.  There were two females at the counter when we walked up and one just looked at us (yes, we were clothed, yes, we were clean, and yes, we smiled when we walked in) and the other said, \""what u like?\""  Whoa, wait a minute!  The bartender kept looking at me, but never smiled and never offered to help, much less mutter a \""hello\"".  Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! \n\nI had a Green Tea Boba Tea and my daughters and their friend had strawberry and passion fruit snow ice, that also was tasty and they said it was yummy.  I am pretty sure fresh fruit is used as the mango snow ice is deemed 'seasonal' and it wasn't available as that is typically a summer fruit.  My tea was good, but not enough to bring me back to bad service.  There's no excuse, there are many other tea houses in the area.  Call me spoiled . . ."
"1","Located in the Vegas Chinatown plazas, and walking distance from Pho Kim Long and Ranch 99 which was just a plaza over, so super convenient. We walked in and were greeted. I already knew what I wanted so I ordered two drinks and paid. Went to go sit down by my friends and the girl who took my order is screaming across the room asking me to pay. I was like, are you serious??? I JUST paid.... and I had my receipt to prove it. I'm guessing she was just confused.. but still... rude. The green milk tea at this location is definitely no where as good as the one in San Diego and Fremont in California. I was super excited to drink it too.... but it ended up tasting whatever. It was good the next day because I was hungover.. but other than that, I wouldn't come back while in Vegas."
"1","Can you say crappy service? They stole $59 from my boba card. Freaking ridiculous. Will never eat here ever again. Waitresses speak broken English and ignores my right too."
"1","My teen kids bug me to stopped for BOBA tea all my way to go to work.They were hungry but i plan to cook for them.They said mommy please just boba tea.Then I said OK.But once they saw the menu that have attractive colorful all pictures of nice looking food again they said they wanted to try.End up with 3 cups boba teas and 3 entrees.And they did not touch the food after first bite.I tried to make them eat but they refuse said the food have to taste.And I sipped my honeydew smoothie with boba.What a fool i was.When i have fresh cut Honey dew at my fringe why did I spent $60 for artificial Honey dew power with iced.People just learn and live.Give two star for fast service and very nice chewy boba."
"2","i now realize why they charge so much for their drinks. the boba is consistently soft and perfect and the drink flavors are mastered to be consistent everytime you come here..ive been coming here for years but the only thing that really holds me back from coming here a few times a week is their price. i just cant see myself spending $15 for two people for 2 drinks everytime"
"2","I've been trying to find a good stylist for a while and I decided to try Megan out at Globe. The salon is nice and Megan was awesome. She took the time to understand exactly what I wanted and offered suggestions along the way. Megan was friendly and talkative and explained what she was doing and why along the way. I've already made my follow up appt."
"1","This office is terribly unorganized and it's a shame because dr scarff is amazing and I won't be coming here again. They don't communicate with insurance companies and try to overbill. The office manager is rude. There's no communication whatsoever and I think it would be nice to notify someone of a \""past due\"" balance before scheduling them for an appointment rather than letting them know they won't be seen when they show up for an appointment. I have 2 insurance companies and both companies have notified me my bill has been paid. This office will get no more money out of me at all."
"1","I saw Dr. Scraff for 14 years he is a great doctor and his assistance are excellent and respectful, however, his office staff lacks the proper training in customer care or problem solving.  Yes even though its a doctor's office there are certain skills that the office staff must have and this staff lacks it.  If you want a great doctor he will provide you the best care you ever asked for but only go to the Spring Valley office where the incidents with the office staff are kept to a minimal."
"2","http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/141554263.html\n\nClosing by the end of the month. Usually I would be sad that another piece of my hometown's history is biting the dust, but since this is a place that really just doesn't care about that, I just feel really numb upon hearing this news. It's still sad though. Thankfully some free time is coming my way so I can pay this spot a visit.\n\nThe Final Verdict (since I didn't do it last time):\n\nPros:\nOut of the ordinary.\nAn independent drugstore, something which is very, VERY rare these days. \nSells a wide variety of items.\nVintage Vegas photos and posters adorn the walls.\n\nCons:\nGrungy.\nI don't think I could stomach the diner (and yet that's the part that's going to stay open. Well isn't that like rain on your wedding day?)\n\nSuggestions: Make it a tourist attraction? On one hand it could keep the place open and provide a tourist attraction that isn't so, well, typical for Vegas. On the other hand, it would stop being a secret and therefore lose it's secret charm. \n\nWould I return? Absolutely, shame the place is closing."
"2","Before there was an Arts District or First Friday, there was the CAC -- promoting art culture in Las Vegas -- run by local artists and volunteers to this day.  The Contemporary Arts Center continues to be a cornerstone of our art community, connecting national and international artists with local artists and audiences.\n\nI joined the CAC because when I moved to Las Vegas, I didn't know where to start and I wanted to volunteer somewhere that mattered, meet people, and connect to the community.  It's been a year now, and mission accomplished: I've met so many wonderful people in the Arts District and even helped put on a few of their exhibitions.  I learned a lot about where to submit my work and what it takes to put on a great show.  Vegas feels like my forever home now, and connecting to the art culture was a big part of that.\n\nBecause the CAC is a 501c3 non-profit organization, it's run by a board of directors, which is open to the public -- so sometimes you have a big board with lots of people and time to plan things, and other years it's just a few people scraping by just to pay the rent.  From short film festivals, to wearable art fashion shows, to controversial paintings on national tour, to brief performance installations ... the CAC doesn't have to stress about whether a piece will SELL, it's whether the piece will MATTER.  And it's because of volunteers who work, and the donors who pay to become members, that this public asset continues two decades later.  How well it's doing depends entirely on how many people will lend a hand and donate a few bucks every year.\n\nLooking through the history has been fascinating about the challenges and successes of these motley crews, and inspiring to see that people from all walks of life can join the organization, have a say in how it's run, and then get hands-on experience with whatever facet of the industry they're interested in.  Artist run spaces can be hit-or-miss, but they're important and rewarding, and the CAC deserves our support."
"1","This chapel is ghetto and incompetent. They charge extra fees for stuff, and charge WAY to much for pictures and your not allowed to take your own pictures inside the chapel, which is bogus since your paying so much to get married there, in our case have your vows renewed there. They also CHARGED us 50$ to have my dad marry us! Why? Who knows, its not like they had to do anything extra to have my dad stand up there. We also went back the next day to buy the overpriced 90$ dvd of the marriage, waited an hr and they still could not find it, had to leave and they said to come back later cause they were open till midnight. We came back around 930pm and THEN they decide to tell me, after waiting another 20mins, that the dvd guy LEFT FOR THE DAY!  I asked if they could call me and let me know if they find it, since they said they record all the weddings yet my mother in law clearly heard them say they werent recording ours and we dont get a dvd, they told me no they could not call and never gave a reason which is all bull. They have crappy customer service and RUDE incompetent people on their staff."
"2","A birthday trip for my boyfriend turned into an elopement.\nAfter six years and a few cocktails we decided, fuck it let's get married. We put our destination wedding plans on the back burner and did it just for us.\n   I found LWWC, we needed cheapish ceremony since we lived the past 4 days up Vegas style. You'd be surprised to know how much it costs to have Elvis marry you anywhere in Vegas. The whole process was painless and super easy. I didn't want to rent a cheap dress,  photographer or flowers. H&M and Gucci(something blue) was just fine for me, the ceremony was about $50. \n I was worried the officiant would be very generic, creepy ect.....Pastor Chris was AMAZING!! Very personal and genuine. He really made the moment special, yes they have a recommended tip, but he was totally worth it.\n    The chapel space itself is very dated and kitchy. Since our friends were going to be our witnesses/photographers we had to do it in the courtyard which was totally fine. Don't forget to pose with the pink Cadillac.\n     Great for a quickie wedding. I wouldn't expect elegance, sophistication  and glamour it's Vegas after all."
"1","Ghetto as hell! Desk staff was friendly.  However, the first room we got, there was dried puke on the floor, so we changed rooms.  The next one was NO better, this charming room had burn marks all over the floor. I kept my flip flops on, even in the shower! I got what I paid for and I will NEVER go cheap on my room ever again! Lesson learned, thanks for NOTHING Expedia!"
"1","WOW and no not in a good way. This place was really bad. The staff was really nice don;t get me wrong but the food was like leftovers from 2 days ago. We visited this buffet last year in May and I hope they have improved since then. We won;t ever find out because we aren't going back any time soon."
"2","I am sad to read all the bad reviews for this place, but come on I had an amazing experience here!  \n\nAfter eating at the Circus Circus buffet the prior day this place was golden.  The servers were friendly and the food was absolutely delicious!  They have anything and everything you could want to eat!  The fruit is fabulous (watermelon so so sweet!), the donuts were yummy, the breakfast foods were scrumptious, the soup was awesome, and pretty much everything else was delicious!  The desserts were so pretty but I was too full to try them!  Although the people in my party said the chocolate cake and cookies were delicious!  \n\nIf the buffet seems too expensive, get an ace card and that will get you like 25% off your buffet.  I think you need to give it a try and you may have an awesome experience.  We went on a Thursday so it wasn't as expensive as a weekend buffet, but try it and you will most likely love it!"
"1","It's not bad, but there is nothing that stands out, either. Breakfast was fine, but expensive. Service was fine. It's okay if you are staying in the hotel, but 100% NOT worth a special trip."
"1","I wish I would have read the reviews before dining here. The truth is they deserve at least two stars for the wonderful food. There is no doubt about it those cheese fries, onion rings and nachos were yummy and really hit the spot. However, if I had to rate the service it would be zero stars. We had to wait to be sat for almost twenty minutes and when we walked into the restaurant there were two servers and only nine guests. Why did we wait outside so long? We waited another 17 minutes and our server never came to our table! I went and found the manager and told him that we've been waiting for way too long and we have no utensils and no server to take our order. The manager was really sweet and took our order at that moment and had the busboy bring us utensils. We ate half of our meal before the waiter (Francisco according to our receipt) finally came by and placed down the onion rings. He did not introduce himself, we asked if he was our server and he rudely said yes and then left. The only other time we saw him was when he dropped off our check with attitude.\n\nPrepare yourself for a long wait, terrible service but good food."
"2","You CANNOT go to Vegas & not stop by this place.  It's as iconic of a place then any of the casinos.  Place is HUGE w/ anything you'd ever want."
"1","Both website and voicemail state they're open from 8 am to midnight, but when we get there at 8:15 am the RUDE security guard says they're open at 9 am. We told him they should change their voicemail and he looks at us again and says coldly, 9 am. Never going back here."
"1","Service at this Denny's was dismal. After waiting for 45 mins for breakfast at 10am, the manager didn't even apologize for the food coming late.\n\nFood was mediocre.\n\nLocation was pretty sketchy.\n\nOnly go to this location if your desperate."
"1","Hmmm...Im not sure what all the rave reviews are about...\nMy husband & I went to Vegas after he returned from a 9 month deployment.  Before our trip, I went online and searched for all the must-do & bargain deals that Vegas offered.  Luv-It Frozen Custard was recommended.  I'd have to say that even before our trip began, I was more looking forward to going to this place than going anywhere else because I LOVE frozen treats.  We couldn't go during the first two days but on the third, when my husband found out that there was a Star Trek convention at the Hilton Hotel, I waved goodbye to him and eagerly made my way to this place.  In my mind, I was going to get Cold Stones portion of the most savory custard and I wasn't going to have to share any of it with my husband...\nWell, when I rounded the corner to this place, I knew I might be in for a let down...just the ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood.  I actually missed the store and had to turn around.  \nWhen I finally got to the parking area, I was surprised because I thought it was a shop that I would be able to walk in to, see the various custards, and pick the one that I wanted.  Instead, I was faced with just a guy hanging his head out the window, asking me what I would like.  \nI ended up getting chocolate chip.  I was unimpressed.  I thought it would come in a cone but he gave me a scoop of it in a styrofoam cup.   The portions were so tiny!  The size...not what I imagined.  The taste...also not what I imagined.  It was like eating soft ice cream.  The price...EQUALLY unimpressive.  How can you call a scoop of ice cream for about $5(?) cheap?  \nI tell you, this place IS NOT a hidden gem.  It may be hidden but it's no gem.  You'll be better off getting your frozen treat from somewhere else like Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio.  You're spending about the same amount of money for more gelato, and you'll get to enjoy it at the Bellagio!  (((I love Bellagio...)))\nAfter the convention, my husband asked me if I wanted to go to Luv-It's now, not knowing that I went without him...I said NO! \nI'm telling you, save your money!  It's just not worth it!"
"2","OMG, DELICIOUS!\nMy husband and I were in Vegas for a friend's graduation and I needed to come here. I'm pretty sure this place was on TV. We actually drove totally out of our way on the way to the actual graduation, and after a big brunch, just to have some custard. \nThey have a variety of custard flavors, which change daily, and a variety of toppings to put on. You can make up your own combo or pick from the board. They also do a standard size unless you tell them you want something else. \nWe ordered the Western Sundae and goggled it up in the car within five minutes. The custard is thick and creamy and the toppings were good. They did skimp on the hot fudge sauce, but I'm not even mad because everything else was so good."
"2","Super low key area. You'd never know this place was here unless you were actively searching for it yourself. I had the vanilla custard in a cone. So creamy and sweet = exactly what you need in the LV of summer"
"2","On the search for the best frozen treat in the Las Vegas Valley my boyfriend and I stopped here because of all the positive reviews and the cool old school vibe. I am glad I thumbed through a couple reviews and learned of the cash only exception. This custard stand is sandwiched between a 7/11 and the olympic gardens in the heart of the Naked City. I am glad we came in the daylight hours if you know what I mean. \n\nThe frozen custard itself was very tasty. I enjoyed the limited selection of flavors of the day, often being indecisive myself. My boyfriend went with a junior sized cup of the malt custard and I had a junior cup of the western with vanilla. I would have love to order an more exciting order but the lady behind the counter didn't give me much of a chance to speak up. Seeming overly excited to close the window blocking out the already 90+ degree temperatures. \n\nOverall fun experience but not as delicious as Lappert's Ice Cream inside the California Hotel and Casino"
"2","Four on a good day, three on others.\n\nIt's a really nice custard, where it goes down to a three is day and time of day you show up.\n\nThis last visit, I was first in line when it opened, so, full selection of flavors for the day. And had flavors that were not vanilla or chocolate. The other flavors were very good. \n\nAs others said, if stuck with vanilla, meh. Wrong day and or late in the day, the flavors they have left might not be inspiring.\n\nSo get there early in the day, and don't add extra stuff to it: order a plain cone or cup, and you should be happy."
"2","I really don't have much of a sweet tooth, but when I have a craving for something sweet and delicious, I gladly make the 40+ mile round trip for LuvIt custard. \n\nPay no attention to the flavor list on the big menu board- just use it as the pricing guide. The daily flavors are posted on the left side of the order window. They have vanilla and chocolate every day along with 2, sometimes 3 daily flavors. The flavors of the day are also listed on their website for weeks and weeks in advance, so you can plan in advance for your favorite daily flavors. They also offer hand packed cartons (pints, quarts...) to go. \n\nAround the holidays they offer their pumpkin custard which is SO fabulous. I will usually order a quart to have on for a yummy holiday treat.  Besides the pumpkin, my favorites are butter pecan, mint chip, wild cherry, peanut butter, and rocky road. My husband's \""go-to\"" treat is the Western Special. \n\nYeah, it's a bit spendy (@ $3.50 for a massive single scoop in a waffle cone); however, all the custard is made in-house daily with high quality ingredients. You'd spend the same, if not more, for factory-made ice cream from Cold Stone."
"2","So dive. Off the beaten path. Comfortable"
"2","Cool bar in a scary location. Great bartender, neat atmosphere, great dive bar. Marked down for sketch walk to/from parking lot."
"2","I've never had a good pizza delivery experience in Vegas. Boston Pizza changed that. It's Friday night and I stayed in with a friend and a lot of wine. A lot of wine later, and this place is the only one willing to deliver. Also, holy mother of Thor, are they GOOD. Not even just \""I'm drunk and hungry\"" level good; I mean, legit good."
"1","Nice location and lots of toppings.  Pizza was soggy and greasy.  Sucks paying for refills and that they don't do pitchers of drink."
"1","Delivery  said 45 minutes came in 1 hr 1/2 . The pizza was disgusting . So much grease , after blotting one slice with a paper towel I went on to use a second , and third ... Soaked completely through . My hands were covered in grease . I can't believe people actually say this is good pizza! Gross! I was starving and couldn't even bring myself to finish a single piece. Will never order from this place again"
"1","I used to love this place, but lately the service has gotten pretty bad. The wait time just to order is like 20 minutes. And the place is usually empty so it doesn't make any sense!"
"2","Cuban Food is something that must be done right without compromise and this place ranks in my Top 5 Cuban restaurants in the nation.  Nestled in an area in between the North & South side of the strip lies some of the best mojitos in town.  Arroz con Pollo, Ropa Vieja, & Maduros are some of my classic Cuban favorites and this place has been very consistent for the last 10 years.  If you have a taste for some Amazing Cuban food and you are in Las Vegas you must eat at the Florida Cafe."
"1","The service was very slow, it took over 30 min for a steak sandwich and the plantains were a joke.  I wouldn't eat there if they gave it to me for free."
"1","World's messiest gift shop! Hahahahaha! Lots of cheap, generic gifts that can be found elsewhere on the Strip. Travel a little further to Fremont Street and you'll find more similar items for much cheaper. Also despite their size, there are no bathrooms for patrons."
"2","Holy cow, this was the fastest smog check I've ever done. It takes longer to fill up my gas than it took to get smogged here, no lie. They have 3 machines so the likelyness if having to wait is slim to none. \n\nI was there for about 4 minutes TOTAL and 2 of them was waiting for the machine to charge my card. The guy was super nice and friendly. They are at a new location which now has bathrooms. Apparently the previous location didn't. \n\nNot only do they give 90 days to rescan for free if needed but if you go on their website you can get a coupon (that you can just show them on your mobile) to bring the price down to $13.99!!! $19.99 regular price isn't bad either though. \n\nANYONE who needs a smog check needs to go here! No questions asked!"
"1","This is the worst place ever!!!!!! The people are ugly. It costs way too much. The place is dirty wouldn't be surprised if you could get an STD by just sitting in one of there nasty seats. The drinks cost way to much and on top of the $30 cover there is a 2 drink minimum. The biggest waste of time in Vegas.\n\nAnd FYI not \""gay friendly\"" just if your wondering"
"1","I'm seeing all these talk threads about where to go for a bachelor's party.  Well, don't GO HERE unless you want to get screwed, no pun intended.  Voted the Best Strip Club in Las Vegas....uhh doubt it.\n\nThis was my first time and probably will be my last time here.  2 Floors.  Sausage fest for the bachelorettes upstairs and what seemed like approximately 88% Southeastern asian chicks downstairs.  The other 12% were of the non-white variety.  We arrived at about 11pm so you figure this is the \""creme de la creme\"" of the talent.  \n\nI literally ONLY lasted 20 minutes inside OG.  It all started with a camera!  It was never meant to be used inside BUT shiznit happens.  Security never gave me any warning and said, \""it's time to say good night\"".  My response was \""GFY and no your not taking my camera!\""\n\nWhat sucked was I never got to buy my buddy a dance here, but I got a pretty detailed report about the debauchery (i'll spare you those details) and shadiness after I got the boot from the fellas.  Apparently everybody saw the one of the dancers just blatantly grab a fresh bottle of GG from our table and just run off with it.  The manager accused my buddy of lying about the incident and the dancer finally fessed up and apologized.  But when it was all said and done.....they replaced it with a bottle of Absolut....WTF kinda BS is this?!?\n\nYes the hummer limo ride was free and so was the cover...but it's still \""slim pickings\"" at OG.  Sure you may get your \""bang for your buck\"" BUT I can't ever recommend a bach party with OG in the mix and you'd have to knock me out and drag me in order to go back.  Juss stick to the Rhino or Sapphire."
"1","This is a review of the male dance review\nA girlfriend and I went to this club on a Sunday night. The strippers were mostly amatuers and they all danced like girls. We called Palomino and they picked us up from OG and we ended up having a great night!! But you know different strokes for different folks!! I'll pass on OG."
"1","\""Free limo and no cover\"" my ass.  Upon arriving at the OG, in the ghetto, by a limo that we were told was \""completely free\"", we were informed that it would be $25 per person.  Granted this included 2 drinks, but I want to dictate my boozing, not someone else.  So I get my drinks, which are completely watered down by the way, and watch some of the girls.  Some were pretty, most were not and all but one were pushy.  No, I don't want a dance.  If I do, I know where to find you and how to ask for one.\n\nFast forward to the stage.  I'm there watching the vagina in my face, albeity behind the girls panties, and my buddy is ordering from one of the cocktail waitresses.  His gaze is away from the dancer for maybe 30 seconds.  I turn and get his attention to check out the dancer, and when he does, she looks at us and says \""You guys aren't even paying attention to me!  Assholes!\"" and then leaves.  I couldn't help but laugh hysterically and go to the bar.  I have 4 or 5 Bud Lights @ $10 bucks apiece.  Each with a $2 tip  Earlier, I had tipped another $10 for my 2 booze drinks as well as another $10 for drinks I bought for my buddies.  Altogether, our group probably left this bartender over $100 within an hour and a half.  \n\nI feel thirsty.  I order a ginger ale.  He tells me $10.  I tell him I just wanted a ginger ale, nothing in it. \""Ten dollars\"".  I laugh in his face, take the rest of my money off the bar and gather the guys to leave.\n\nIf you fucks over there are reading this, you screwed up bigtime. The 6 of us were just getting ready to do private dances and were preparing to stay until you kicked us out.  Die in a fire, all of you.  Except the hot cocktail waitress with the nice tits and personality."
"2","Hands down the best barber shop in Vegas.  A man's barber shop.  Simple and classy.  Tommy gave me a great cut and trimmed the beard.  Easy to walk in and get taken care of.  I will be a lifetime customer."
"2","great hair cuts tommy did a great job he definitely has a new customer on his hands great ppl old school barbers old school cuts goin back everytime"
"2","Walking past it, you would think this was a divey place with terrible food.  My friends brought me here and the soup was awesome.  I forget the name of it, I think it was Tom Kar Gai.  Mmmm, I could go for some right now."
"2","This place is definitely in the shadier side of town. Just on the other side of the parking lot is a motel, which has a wedding chapel and seems like the rooms get rented out by the hour. Also, as a hint to those who have a hard time finding it, the place doesn't seem to have lighted signs, which in stark contrast to all the places around it.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered the Thai Papaya Salad, Pad Thai with Beef, and Red Curry with Chicken (~$29 total) as take-out. I really was expecting mediocre or worse. However, it was better than I expected. Granted it wasn't the best I've ever tasted. But, it you're looking for some reasonably priced Thai food near the Strip, this is a good place to check out. General flavors were there. The papaya salad had good flavor and kick, though a bit on the soggy side, which might have been due to the time between cooking and consumption for take-out."
"2","I was skeptical at first. I really wasn't sure what to expect from the place. I ordered red curry with shrimp spicy and my wife had green curry with shrimp and we shared Hawaiian fried rice. It's been two days since we were there and I'm craving my curry. The price was reasonable and the service was great. Both of our curry had more than enough shrimp and good flavor. The fried rice was excellent and even better the next day. We'll definitely going back."
"2","I shop everywhere for tires, including Craigslist.  I tend to lean towards rim shops since they usually have good condition take-offs from people that up-size their rims.  So, I was driving by this place and thought, \""Hub Cap Annie's, that sounds like a cool place that has a family history in Vegas AND it's a rim shop\"", double points.  Since I love supporting locals I navigated through a wacky intersection and made a couple of U-turns to access it.  Well it was worth it because I got a pair of pre-owned tires for just under $100.  Michelins, no less.  New they would have been at LEAST $130 EACH.  These have almost all of their tread. \n It's not the greatest neighborhood as tweakers are wandering around and crackheads are selling giant pixie sticks on the corner and drunks are stumbling up asking what day it is, but it's totally safe, clean and friendly on the inside."
"2","This was my favorite place when I lived in Vegas. Good beef dishes. A consistent kitchen preparing time-honored recipes. Sabado Gigante on the TV renders it somehow m\u00e1s aut\u00e9ntico."
"1","When you use your AMEX credit card, they make you pay the tip by cash so that the owners doesn't have to pay AMEX the fee. Not legal to force a customer to pay the tip in cash and not put it on your credit card.\n\nThe Cuban sandwich was not the traditional sandwich. It was skimpy and the pork was not of a pernil style. When I ordered the plantains, I only got 4 plantains and for the price, it wasn't worth paying for it."
"2","The place is open 24/7, is pretty quick with orders, is priced very competitively. I have yet to find a better place for tortas!"
"1","I gave this location such a low rating because the store is usually a mess. Having worked in supermarkets before I've noticed that products you think would be in the same aisle are in a completely irrelevant spot. Their shelves need to be reset in a better manner."
"1","Hands down the worst target I've ever been to. Grew up in this neighborhood and even in high school it was still a nightmare. Unorganized, dirty, never well-stocked and the patrons...YIKES. I know that probably shouldn't factor into my rating but good God, this is the one place I am guaranteed to be run over by a rogue cart of a mother of 8 kids under the age 10 who's letting one of those 8 wield the cart. Unacceptable."
"2","Went here for a smog check. Fast, friendly and smog check special discounted at $15.95."
"2","Click here to see the video\nhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=21mXCyAfq_U"
"2","If you don't like these tacos, you're smoking crack. My family from San Diego who are taco snobs had their jaws dropped by the freshness of this food. The only downside to this place is it's location. Kinda shady area but not too bad."
"1","Even though Los Tacos is one of my favorite taco stands in Las Vegas. I went there today at 8:10pm, waited at the drive thru menu for 10min. Thought maybe it was broke. Drove up to the window, 6 employees were standing behind the counter. I honked the horn several times and tried to waive them down. They ignored me like I didn't exist. This wasn't the first time I arrived before 9pm which is the time that's posted that they close and they closed early. They could of at least had the decency to tell me they were closed, don't ignore me when you know I'm there. Now I see why Tacos El Gordos next store remains busy. It's not just the quality of food, it's also the appreciation and respect of your loyal customers!"
"2","8 college buddies who graduated in 1982 are getting together in Vegas and time is of the essence so we don't want to be wasting time making our way to a liquor store and shopping for the weekend's beverages.  What to do ?   Call Mo at XO Liquors.  Place your order,  Mo will tell you the prices,  close the deal,  get your order and receipt via email,  and Mo delivers your entire order to the front door of the hotel right when you tell him to be there  -  and the party is on !   Great prices and superb service.  Shopping in an actual store when you can do it online before you ever arrive and have it delivered is for amateurs."
"1","I have a contract with National Home Warranty for a year. About 6 months ago my oven was broken, and then I called them to came out to fix it. Until now they haven't done it yet. When I called customer service for the answer, they said it's not their job I have to contact direct to their contractor to have the answer. I don't know what kind of shit job they do. The worst service I have never met."
"1","Avoid this place unless you want your antiquing experience ruined. I don't think the owner has all of her marbles.  She showed me some items that weren't priced yet then refused to another item that WAS priced saying it was too low! I won't be back."
"2","Food still good, but the wait was loong. Upon seating, we were told the kitchen was slow today, which I'm glad they told us beforehand. On a Sunday afternoon, this place was more packed than I've ever seen it. Food was gooood. Pad-see-eww was yummy"
"2","Delicious!  I had the mushroom tom yum, spring rolls, fried sweet potatoes, pineapple fried rice, and pad thai (all from the vegetarian menu).  The pad thai was my favorite.  The tofu had a nice texture; I believe it was fried.  We also ordered it with the soy chicken and that was good too.  I ordered the soup WAAAAY too spicy, but it was good.  BTW, their cup of soup is HUGE.  I was expecting the size to be similar to miso soup (like how it's served at sushi places) but it was much bigger.\n\nI would definitely return to Komol when in Vegas.  If you are a vegetarian, it is worth checking out."
"2","Looks are definitely deceiving here.  Doesn't look like much outside, or inside.  Very small and cramped.  They might think about removing the booths to open up the space.  I came on a Monday night, and the place was packed; which says a lot.  I was finally seated, but quickly grew annoyed because it seemed the waiter forgot about me while waiting on others that had sat down after me.  Nevertheless, I finally ordered some chicken panang.  I was in for a feast.  The portion was huge, and I can eat a lot in one sitting!  Very rich with coconut milk and red curry.  I ordered a level 10 spiciness, but it came out as a 2.  Obviously \""white-washed.\""  The flavor was outstanding however.  I think I need to become somewhat of a regular, so they know I'm not messing around when I say, \""make it spicy!\"""
"1","I was excited to try this place because of the yelp reviews, although we wanted to go to Lotus of Siam. We regret our decision.\n\nThe herb salad was the best thing we ordered. Fried catfish was tasty, but tad salty. Duck fried rice was good. The beef massaman was SO sweet ... But it's my first time having that dish so I don't know.  But the biggest disappointment was the soft shell crab... It was EXtremely salty!! So salty, my tongue was stinging. We had to consume so much rice to offset the heavily salted food. \n\nI don't know if they used MSG, but we were so tired after the meal, 4 of us went back to our hotel room and passed out. (Not going out like our original plan. It was Saturday night)\n\nI would not go back again."
"1","I swore the last couple times I've been here I said to myself never again. Komol used to be my favorite Thai Restaurant in town at one time. They used to deliver to my work, so I ate their food frequently. The last few times I've been there I have noticed the food isn't as good as it used to be. \n\nWe went there last night, had a reservation, when we arrived the employees were running around like crazy. The place was busy, but not anything crazier than I've seen it before. \n\nWe are seated and wait for awhile for someone to take our orders. She finally comes and we are both famished. Had we known what was about to transpire, we would've ordered our entrees. So we eat our salad, and she comes to take out entree order. We waited ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. I was so hungry I was close to walking out. Then, my entree arrives. Mine only. The waitress leaves the table. Doesn't say a word about my friends dish. I sit patiently staring at my food. We call her over to see what's going on and she says \""it will be out soon\"". So I'm sitting there patiently for my friends food to arrive, where I come from it's rude to eat without everyone having their entree. Ten minutes later it arrives. My Pad Kee Mao was less than stellar. I ate the shrimp out of it and left everything else. Needless to say, I won't be going back."
"1","As a vegetarian, I was really excited to try this place out, but unfortunately had a really bad experience.\n\nCame in the other night around 8:30pm, wasn't busy at all, we were sat and waited almost 20 minutes before we were even greeted at the table, after we ordered we waited another 30 minutes for the food to come, our pad Thai was cold, and they forgot our other plate, and when it finally came it was burnt. And that still would've been okay but our server was unapologetic and didn't seem to care.\n\nI work as a server as well and know things can get busy and mistakes can happen and I am sympathetic with that. But the overall service was bad, slow, and the food was disappointing."
"2","Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not related to the owner nor do I have stock in this restaurant.\n\nMy family spent 6 days in Vegas shoveling in buffet after buffet.  I was in desperate need of Korean food, and I have pretty low expectations when it comes to Vegas Korean food.  Nevertheless, I took my chances with yelp, and we stumbled across this place.  \n\nWe ordered jjambong, chicken cutlet, dolsot bibimbab, and some fish dish.  The banchans came out first, and it was very impressive.  The main dishes came out, and each dish was spot on.  I'm not going to dissect each dish, but each dish could have been it's own restaurant.\n\nIf you saw what I looked like, you would trust my food review.  \n\nThis is the first legitimate Korean restaurant we have eaten at.  This restaurant could definitely keep up with the popular restaurants in k-town.  \n\nIf you come here and complain that the service was bad or the walls didn't meet your artistic needs...come on.   Asian people aren't known for their service, so let's get over that aspect.\n\nIf you are craving something spicy and tired of the omelette and meat stations, give this place a try."
"2","I love Marie Callender's and this one didn't disappoint me.  The service was very quick and super friendly.   The food is great and the portions are good.   Eating here is always a good value and here it was a good experience."
"2","My mainstay of food has changed drastically within the last month or two my food intake has relied mainly on take out of my favorites and fast food.  If I do review fast food it is not the food I am reviewing because there is a standard of quality that must be maintained or the standard of the fast food chain will be compromised however that changes within the management of each chain.  \n\nWhew with that said, The quality of every meal I get here is excellent as far as fast food goes.  However the quality of customer service goes above and beyond.  They are super nice in the speaker always polite and the order is also correct as well as the side/sauces!  I am always happy and happy to be happy in the speaker and at the window to the employees because they are so nice!\n\nI will continue to eat here because I have never had a problem and the employees are so extremely NICE whats up?! Thank you..."
"1","Horrible and dishonest jewelry store!! Went in with my fianc\u00e9 to get a quote on a custom engagement ring setting (we already had the center stone) and we dealt with Barry. He was very friendly and got us a quote based on pictures of a setting I loved, it was 3500$. So a week later I emailed him to say that I was ready to move forward and we had bought some of the side diamonds to add into the setting and I wanted an updated quote. Barry emailed me a quote of MORE than DOUBLE the original price!! With less diamonds they would need to provide how does this make sense? Total scammers and dishonest! Oh and I did have quotes done by other custom jewelers and they were all between 3 and 4 thousand... BEWARE!!!!"
"1","The photos your \""photographer\"" took at my brother's ceremony were absolute garbage. Your \""photographer\"" should go back to school and relearn the ART of photography and a little basic info on photoshop because i took better pictures on my canon rebel.. Sad. My mom paid $100 for a group photo and your \""photographer\"" was so terribly RUDE and made us feel we were inconvenicing him... When that was your purpose... You were providing a service and working for the couple who was getting married. Your \""photographer\"" did not even take a picture of the couple and their best man/maid of honor... Very little to absolute NO editing was done on these photos and my brother and new sister-in-law are very dissapointed about these photos and that's a darn shame because this should be one of the funnest parts of getting married, seeing the after photos. Our family lives far apart and are not together often... The most important photo we wanted to get was a decent family shot and you did a pathetic job, a D- effort. You made NO effort with trying to get the kids to smile... I do a better job in my sleep and am just a SAHM with a standard DSLR. Reverend was great but everything else was little to be desired... the rule about no photos inside of the rings or boquet was obserd... tip of advice: place the rings on a decorative surface,a delicate fabric or on the boquet and use a zoom lens... a countertop is tacky... Wouldnt recommend to a friend EVER which makes me sad because this place has such a good rep and we really really really expected so much more."
"1","My mother recently got married here & the wedding itself was super cute but lets get to the point of the two stars.....\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHY IS HORRIBLE.\nThey do not allow any of your guests attending to take pictures during the wedding so they can screw you over pretty much. The pictures they took were SO FAR AWAY the people in them look so tiny. Tons of the pictures had very high contrast too which made my mother look like a ghost OR they were so dark you can barley see some of the guests in group pictures! After complaining they said it'd be $70 an hour for someone to go through and crop them AFTER already purchasing prints. (Keep in mind we don't live in Nevada) After multiple more calls & complaints to the manager they finally agreed to take her pictures back and replace them with closer up photos for no charge BUT the woman helping, my mother described, as very rude and snotty about helping her. Not a great experience."
"1","bad company, sometimes good but mostly bad. have ask for pickup of some palm fronds from a tree trimming and they promised twice to pick up after the original trash day service missed them. they are still in the driveway."
"1","Seriousley, I do not understand how they get 4 to 5 star review from customer.  This restaurant is not even own by Japanese owner.  I am Japanese and tast of fish was ok.  I visited this place because of a good rating, but I guess I was spoiled grow up in Japan and live in CA for many years.   I do not recommended to eat sushi or even some Japanese food at this place."
"2","Great spot....sssssh...don't tell anyone"
"2","I love that Japan is a world of nonsense and absurdity. I fully embrace things like a restaurant only playing ABBA. And if that is what you are looking for, then Tokyo Japanese Restaurant completely delivers on that front. The sushi and other dishes are all solid, but nothing really blew me away. And for that reason, if it was not for the great and friendly service (and the ABBA), I would give this joint three stars. The service was so spot-on, with all of the staff willing to help out on anything you may need. We went with the all-you-can-eat menu, which has a great variety of apps, dishes, and sushi. At $27 a person, it is a fairly decent deal, and let's you order at will. Insider Tip: If you are the height of a normal American male, watch your head on the hanging lanterns."
"1","What a horrible business with atrocious customer service! I learned of Tiger Lilly at the Las Vegas Bridal Spectacular in August of 2014. The representatives seemed very pleasant and accommodating. Don't they all at the beginning? We scheduled a time for a phone consultation the Wednesday after the show. They never called. A month goes by, and I finally e-mail them to find out what happened. Marina Bradstreet responds, apologizes, and indicates she will give me a quote for my wedding. I provide her *exactly* what I'm looking for - down to the specific design and number of bouquets, boutonnieres, corsages, etc. Two week go by, and I don't hear from her. I e-mail her again asking when to expect the quote as I have other vendors who are waiting on me to make a decision. She replies that it is \""impossible\"" to give me the quote because they are in the process of moving offices and she's \""too busy\"" with the current wedding season. Impossible? Really? The other florists I contacted had me a quote the same day. You mean to tell me this business doesn't have time to take 5 minutes out of their day to generate a quote? Unbelievable. Needless to say, they lost out on my wedding, and I would recommend others stay faraway. You can find quality florists elsewhere in Las Vegas without the abhorrent customer service. Don't waste your time with Tiger Lilly.\n\nP.S I'm willing to forward the e-mails I got from Marina to whoever wants them so you can see how horrid the customer service really is. Just shoot me a message and I'll be glad to send them your way."
"1","Congratulations to the Democratic party for being so divided that they can't even agree on a candidate to be considered for the general election.  Nice job fellas.  You're pushing a candidate who didn't even get a clear majority of YOUR party's votes lol.  What's one half of one half?  A quarter of the whole?  Why don't you just give McCain the keys to the White House already."
"1","The worst customer service ever. I brought my daughter here to find a dress for a sweet 16 Party. We found a gorgeous dress but unfortunately both ladies ignored . The Lady on the sales floor watched us but never attended to us while the other Lady stayed in the back. Beautiful dresses  ,  however when spending money I'd prefer customer service to be attached to the \""SERVICE\"". \nNO STARS !"
"2","I am not a person who likes to go to Filipino restaurants to eat (because my mom is the best Filipina cook ever) but I enjoyed the food and the experience here. The server/cashier was very friendly and very helpful, he had a smile on his face for every customer. He even told a couple of jokes and pointed to me where the the nearest Goldilock's was. \n\nThe food was good, it was a lot better than a lot of other Filipino restaurants I've tried. I ordered the pork adobo, pancit palabok, and bbq pork to go. All of it was good, I especially liked the bbq pork that I would order again. They also serve you the food a la carte style so the best time to come is early when everything is still fresh. The portions are huge too, I had a good amount of leftovers. \n\nIf I am ever back in Vegas I am sure I will visit them again. They are very welcoming and they make you feel very comfortable."
"1","they have gone down hill...theyre not as good as they once were."
"2","I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because they are still around. 10 years ago this was one of the only restaurant to eat Filipino food and 10 years later, the food is still up to part and the service is great. \n\nVery consistent with the food taste."
"1","Food is adequate to satisfy the appetite.  Served cafeteria-style.  I had the pancit and lechon.  My mother makes way better pancit, and the lechon was either dry or had to much fat on it.  Food is mediocre at best."
"1","Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car. I checked and they cleared the code right before I bought the car. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW!! Never ever go to this dealership, They lie just to get you to buy a car."
"1","Until I visited Valley, I was actually in a nursing program at NSC.  My experience here singlehandedly changed all that and made me realize I didn't want to be a nurse.  \n\nIn the ICU, the nurses are overworked, stressed, and hostile.  During a brief volunteer stint, I witnessed firsthand multiple mix-ups with records, nurses being given WAAAAY more patients than is safe to handle at one time, and nasty attitudes in regard to patient requests.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that what I saw upset me enough that I immediately switched career paths entirely.  The nurses were MISERABLE.  As a former teacher who was pretty miserable myself in that profession, I couldn't IMAGINE going into a field where I would be equally miserable.  That's the impression this place gave - that it's an awful place to work or be laid up.  It was so bad, in fact, that I contacted hospital administration about some of the awful things I witnessed.  I don't know if it ever came to anything, but I sure hope it did for the sake of the patients.\n\nDuring training to work or volunteer in the Valley Healthcare System, they constantly refer to patients as \""consumers\"" - oh yes, we need to make the \""CONSUMERS\"" happy.  This dehumanizing attitude prevailed throughout my experiences in this hospital.  Patients weren't treated as valuable human beings.  Instead, they were treated like these sick, annoying cash cows for the hospital.  How awful.\n\nIf you have a choice (and I know sometimes you don't), I'd advise you to choose a different hospital for yourself or your loved ones.  If you're going to be viewed as a consumer - if that's REALLY all you are - then you might as well be an educated one."
"2","I have heard about Broadway Pizzeria for years know from new yorkers. I was in the area so we decided to get a pizza to go. We got a cheese pizza and it was great!!! The place was packed and it was only about 4pm. The staff was very friendly. As i recently became vegetarian and trying to become a vegan i will return about one more time as i am not going to eat dairy anymore. I sure wish i started to go there years ago, as everything looked great. My three year old who is not a big eater ate two giant slices. What more can you say considering most pizza she eats she will only take a couple of bites. I am originally from the philly-new york area and it does rank up to the good pizza places back there."
"1","Another visit.  The pizza is adequate but is still blander than I like. I had an especially surly waitress."
"2","Want a TRUE NY style pizza? Come here... best thing in town. Love this place and the people.  Great service, affordable food and their ranch dressing is the best thing ever.  I wish we lived closer but they deliver pretty much anywhere in town.  \n\nLove you Broadway!!!!"
"2","we ordered food from my job yesterday and the food was so good .it was very stressed and delivered in about 20 to 25 minutes I was very impressed .the only thing I would do differently is next time I'll get the hot habanero sauce I need a little more spice .thank you from the staff at valley hospital ."
"2","Anyone who is looking to volunteer in Las Vegas, start here. The staff is very friendly.  I just had my first experience at their dinner service. It is very organized, clean,  and those who are in need are very gracious and friendly as well. Will definitely continue to volunteer here, they do great work and have established meaningful relationships with those in need."
"1","Parking in the mall is horrible. We went into the parking structure and was caught in a line of cars that wouldn't move. After 15 minutes in a traffic jam without parking, we decided to leave. And we couldn't get out. Half an hour later after entering the traffic nightmare, we are still unable to exit the parking lot. The folks they hired to direct traffic are not able to manage the traffic and pedestrians. My suggestion is to NEVER come to this mall unless you can afford to spend 45 mins or more stuck in the parking traffic."
"1","You evil, awful Monopoly, cash-grubby company.\n\nCurrently have the \""bundle\"" offered by Cox. Phone, Internet, and Cable. First off, why doesn't Cox offer a decent combo of Internet and Cable these days? NO ONE has a land-line anymore! Get with it Cox, the land line phone is DEAD.\n\nInternet is mediocre. And when I'm paying this much for Internet, it better not be mediocre. Every morning about the same time my Internet mysteriously disappears. It also happens once or twice a day - just no Internet. I've called Cox and they've had me restart my router, restart my computer, etc - but no help. They have told me before that perhaps the problem is MY router, hm, no Cox... maybe the problem is YOU.\n\nMAIN REASON I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW:\n\nA few weekends ago I was having a party. This party was to celebrate the UNR vs UNLV game which was being broadcast on one of the public Cox Cable Channels. The newspaper had stated for about a week that the game would be broadcast on that channel. So, I have a ton of people at my house and we are having a good time and it's time for the game.... um, what is this? This is not the game, where is the game? I look to make sure the time is right, I switch channels, I switch it back, I look in the paper.... yes, no? WHERE IS THE GAME?! At this point I have 15 people and no football game. I call Cox:\n\n\""Excuse me, why isn't the UNR vs UNLV game being broadcast?\""\n\n\""Oh, we're sorry, we're having technical difficulties trying to get the game up. It will be up shortly.\""\n\n\""Oh okay, thank you.\"" *hang up*\n\nSuddenly - GAME APPEARS! Except..... there's no sound and it looks like it's being shot with a freaking 8mm camera!\n\nI AM ENRAGED. I call Cox again, while at the same time my friends have turned on the radio (where the game is being broadcast) so we can watch the TV/listen to the game.\n\n\""Yes, hello... I just called about the UNR vs UNLV game? Well, I have picture, but there's no sound.\""\n\n\""Oh yes, we're sorry, but we're only getting visual right now. We're working on it.\""\n\n\""Oh, do you have an idea of when it will be up? Because we're listening to the radio and watching the TV.\""\n\n\""Well, we really don't know... (silence for some reason). However, ma'am if you would like you can switch over to ESPN3 where the game is being broadcast right now.\""\n\n\""Umm, I don't have ESPN3 on my package. I thought you guys were broadcasting this game? It's an important game. The papers said you would be broadcasting it! How can it not be running right?!\""\n\n\""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but like I said, if you'd like we can bill you for $25 to watch the game on ESPN3....\""\n\n\""EXCUSE ME? CAN YOU REPEAT THAT? YOU WANT ME TO PAY $25 TO WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME.... IN MY HOUSE? THAT YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE BROADCASTING?!\""\n\n\""(stupid customer service agent apologizing and doing NOTHING)\""\n\nSo I hung up and we watched the game until HALFTIME when miraculously (amazing how it happened), all of the sudden when the commercials came back AFTER HALFTIME the game was back on and completely different!\n\n#1 - Sound\n#2 - No more 8mm, grainy looking shit-show\n#3 - ESPN3 logo in the bottom right corner.... hmmm?\n\nYes, those bastards tried to swindle people into buying that game because they KNEW people wanted to watch it. So they held out on doing what they said they would do until halftime, which is broadcast a football game. They're awful, evil people and I hate them."
"1","I thought Comcast was bad!\n\nCox is by far the worst cable provider in the USA! \n\nFirst, their basic service pricing is outrageous. \n\nSecond, their phone service is horrible and every little add on is extra. \n\nThird, customer service is worst than the Indian call centers.\n\nFourth, and this is a huge issues: the Internet service is SLOW! I used to pay $40/month for 100mb/s up and down. Cox charges $50 a month for 1/10th that amount on download and 1mb/s upload. To get more it's $300 a month! What a fucking rip!!!!\n\nThese idiots actually think people are stupid!\n\nWhatever you do-find another provider for the above services. PLEASE!\n\nI hope these jerks go out of business and a reputable company takes its place!!!!!!"
"1","Monopoly. Yeah, I went there. Really, if you want high speed internet do you have an alternative? No. Cox knows this and charges appropriately. The service is for the most part reliable but as luck has it when it goes down it seems to do so at the worst times. \n\nI really wish there was an alternative to paying out the nose for cable and internet services. We mainly watch 2-3 channels and that seems to be Nick Jr. and the Disney Channel for my 2 year old, the phone line is mainly used by people looking for the previous person who had our number, and $70 a month for the internet portion that's fast but not fast enough just leaves us going Ugh! every month when we pay the bill. \n\nIf you call in you can get good service, but we've also had clueless technicians come out and mangle our wiring, and they called in and added things that mucked up our bill. It's like sometimes the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing over there, and the consumer is the one who ends up having to fix their mess. \n\n2 Stars: One for Internet speed, One for customer service reps who are nice."
"1","This is just for the whole management of Cox Services in Las Vegas.\n\nCox is just like any oil company that pops in your head. Their monopolistic practices have made them the only acceptable cable/internet/phone provider in Clark County and they intend to do anything to bar out intruding services to compete with their digusting enlisted prices. I come from Los Angeles, where we get the same services that Cox provides for about half off. But the price is what makes the difference and Cox loves to suck the life out of you if they have to.\n\nBecause I spend a great deal of time online for multiple purposes, I need fast internet. To get that kind of service, I am forced to pay $50-55. JUST for internet. In Los Angeles,  you can get both cable AND internet for that price. Cox understands that they are the lone cable provider so they take advantage of this town.\n\nSad thing is, you really can't say no here unless you get Dish or Direct TV. If you do get those services, you must sign for a long term commitment which in truth, is technically cheaper in the long run.\n\nCox will never have lenience on your finances but it's not like you really have a choice. Even the customer representatives are hesitant when they say the prices over the phone because it makes even them throw up. I'm hoping that other services start making their way and once they do, Cox can go fuck themselves."
"1","I had Cox TV, Internet and landline phone installed into my home in September 2013. By November I noticed that my Internet's service speed had degraded to 5 MB per second download instead of the 25 MB per second I was paying for. I called Cox and had a service tech come to my home. The service tech examined the situation and told me the Cox service tech who had earlier installed the equipment did not use the proper cable couplers and that was the cause of the problem. I watched the tech install new cable couplers in the Smart box and reboot the system. The fix worked and my internet speed increased significantly. \n\nI got my Cox bill today and I noticed a $39.99 service charge. I called Cox and spoke to a customer service rep who told me the service ticket read \""Installer #5145 reset modem and internet works fine\"". I shared with the customer service rep what really happened, and protested that why should I have to pay for a mistake made by an earlier Cox installer. The customer service rep transferred me to supervisor #T16512, who told me that there is nothing she could do because the work order write up indicated the charge was valid. \n\nTotal time on phone was 44 minutes 99% of which was being placed on hold. \n\nI will be switching from Cox this week. \n\nBottom line is they are a bunch of crooks!"
"1","I am extremely disappointed in the Cox services. We have their internet service (wireless), and it is very poor quality. The internet is slow (no matter what device we use and no matter what room of the house), and occasionally it will stop working for a few minutes and then randomly come back on. After about 8 months of this service, we got a notice from Cox that they were increasing our monthly bill (for the same crappy service). We just switched to Century Link, and it is SO much better. And cheaper! The only way to get better Cox service is to pay even MORE and upgrade to a higher-speed package... unacceptable. We've had bad experiences with Cox when we lived in Georgia as well, so we will never be signing up for Cox services again."
"1","I pay about $126/month for high speed internet, contour 6 HD cable with HBO, and a phone line that I don't use (only bc it would've been the same price if I got everything a la cart. When I ordered the service I definite spoke to a really good hustler.\n\nPros- Internet is amazingly quick. Contour is a great feature but $$$.\n\nCons- I am trying to watch my DVR'ed shows and getting this \""Technical Difficulty\"" message. I would rather not have to call to reset my box. This happens fairly often. Also, sometimes my TV shows get cut off at the end so I've gotten in the habit of extending the recording 5 mins past just to be sure. There have been times also where my shows just did not properly record. Searching for TV shows is a nuisance (having to type each show title) and going through window after window in order to set multiple show recordings or delete the show from the list. \n\nWhen I lived in San Diego I much preferred AT&T but unfortunately they do not service Las Vegas. The features they had of being able to reset your box via your computer, record options at 2 presses of a button, and just have a system that is more user friendly was just more convenient and less annoying. It was also much much more inexpensive."
"1","Seriously has to be the WORSE cable company in the nation. I have family all over the country and cox communications is horrid. The service is spotty and the connection is never stable. I don't know why anyone would want to voluntarily keep this company as a provider. They charge 20 dollars over the next provider (century link) and I changed to century link and the service is FLAWLESS!!! NOT ONE DROPPED CONNECTION!! been with them 3 months now. In three months I lost connection with cox communications over 2 dozen times. I'm tired of *buying new equipment to meet the high speed standard every 3 months* or buying \""faulty equipment\"" according to my old cox rep. You know what u guys are criminals trying to make a killing, offering substandard service and unreliable customer relations. You are overcharging everyone and you are careless to your customers. I hope you go bankrupt!!!"
"1","I had originally intended to submit an eloquent review of the horrifying service provided by Cox - but clearly it's not worth spending the time.  Mine would just be another in a long line of one-star reviews.  Suffice it to say that I am no longer - and will never again be - a Cox customer.  I hope all those who have a choice will take the time to read the reviews here, take them to heart, and find another provider.  Cox should be ashamed of both their unethical business practices and their horrifyingly bad service."
"1","Cox cable and Internet services may not be the best choice when you have options. \n\nThe company is large and they like to use that size to bully more than for improvement of service and services. \n\nI have been a loyal customer for many, many years and year after year my bills change without cause, they like to play up sell games, and even force you to take services you do not need, all in the name of savings. Don't be fooled as the savings are always temporary and in the end you always pay.\n\nThis company could be great, increase customer count and be the leader, but they choose to prey on unsuspecting customers, be overbearing in forcing staff to oversell and leave customers disheartened, and worse play the pricing games.\n\nThe people are good, the process is broken and inconsistent and the product is in demand. A simple fix could turn this company's rating the right direction, but only time will tell as technologies change who the winners and losers will ultimately be."
"1","Cox Cable is a joke. Ridiculous prices for crappy service. Yesterday the cable was out & today the internet is down. I pay my bill on time every month & I expect continuous service. But that is not the case.  I lose service on a weekly basis be it cable or internet. When I call they offer to credit my account $7.00. Get out of here!!! Seriously??!! After 8 years maybe they could treat me a little better! I wont mention the fact that their equipment is crap. I have had to replace my DVR like 6 times in a year because all of a sudden I live to close to the cable box. I have lived in the same apartment for 5 years & this only started happening in the last year. But that is the excuse they gave me. All I can say is wow. \nThey dont deserve a star. But I had to give them one to post.\nCox sucks cox."
"1","Cox Communications is a dishonest, arrogant, self serving, expensive company that I tell everyone to avoid. They're advertisements are pure lies as to what you get when purchasing a service.  They're price discounts last for only a short period of time and then you get hit with the full price which they hide and don't disclose.  They make you buy bundles of crap TV channels in order to get the few channels you want.  They have recently improved their broadband internet speeds, because Centurylink is bringing in fiber 1 gig, but before that, you couldn't get anywhere near the advertised speed.  The only reason they're still in business is because they bribe the local elected officials with massive campaign contributions to keep competition out, and advertise intensely, especially that they gave a pittance to a local charity. They block access to sites they don't want you to go to because they're not their business cronies, and they give preferential speed to their cronies, and lie about it to cover it up. Corrupt doesn't even begin to describe it."
"1","The \""hot\"" sandwich came out just warm(as a result of it being left out after it was toasted) and I feel I got shafted on the portions. There are definitely better options than this."
"2","Dr. Nelson is a wonderful woman and doctor!  She was the first out of 4 drs who I felt truly comfortable with the care of my 5 yr old child.  She did an amazing job on his surgery and if you're looking for a dr who shows respect and true ability to make your entire process as easy as possible, she's the one to go to!  She went to the extent of giving us her home phone number in case we needed to reach her post surgery for any questions or concerns.  Truly gifted!"
"1","I was super excited to check out their HUGE store. Once we started looking around, there were two distinct things I noted. 1. The quality of furniture is NOT very good when considering the pricing. 2. The sales people seemed fairly pleasant when approaching us, but I overheard several conversations between them and they were incredibly unprofessional and down right rude to each other. Geesh, competition!!!  \n\nOther than that, I have no desire to go back. I'll stick with R.C. Willey."
"1","OK...So I originally gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I didn't sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Walker and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to \""check out the situation\"" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to \""check out the situation\"" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I\""m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of \""suspect\"" furniture."
"1","I went in to Walkers and spent close to $2800.00 on a bedroom set and a dinning room set and some mattresses on 7/26/14. At the time I purchased the items a number of thing were not divulged to me. The fact that the bedroom set I had purchased was not in stock and I was told it would be delivered the next week, but it is 8/1/14 and no bedroom set for maybe a couple weeks????? The dining room set I purchased arrived with some wear on it, I called to have it replaced and when they came to pick up the old set the new set also had \""distressed\"" markings on it. I was never told that the table was \""distressed\"" when I paid full price for a brand new table and chairs. Someone needs to let the consumer know at the time of purchase when an item will be delivered and if it is being sold \""as it\"" or \""distressed\"". Nothing was ever said to me about this or is there any notation on my paperwork."
"1","Over 6 calls to Walker last night. Disconnected each time. Either intentionally or mechanical doesn't matter. When calling back receptions should have stayed on line if Walker really wants to correct this and got a person on phone with me. Continued stalls tactics by the dishonest Walker company.."
"1","My boyfriend and I are looking for a nice tie and dress shirt. He was torn between the other ties from the other shop so we took our time to discuss and weigh things. Staff named carol was Very unprofessional. Very rude.She was complaining that she was tired and they have a long day and telling us if you don't buy the tie let me have it.No wonder they have no customers inside the shop. I will never never recommend this shop to anybody. Very bad customer service. And very sad because this is how they treat they're customers especially people from out of town."
"1","For a Chinese restaurant, this is one of the worst fried rice I have ever had. it was dry and flavorless. Everything didn't have any taste."
"1","This place is overstaffed, and in fact right when you walk in there is no warm welcome to the store. Everyone who works there is busy. Sadly my experience here was dissapointing because they didn't have what I was looking for. \n\nThe store seems to be under construction. There was a bum in the music section just playing his little heart out on the piano, all intoxicated. (felt uncomfy)\n\nThere is no variety of product. Service is poor."
"1","Maybe it depends on the time you go....but I was not impressed by the catfish AT ALL! I went on a weekday around 4pm. The catfish was dried out and frail! The flavor was O-K but not everything these other reviews are claiming. Again it could be I was just there at the wrong time......although I feel a good quality place should have good quality food 24-7?! I also had the mac and cheese which was just an epic fail altogether and extremely bland potato salad. The cornbread muffin was burnt and dry. I live in Providence area and I'm so disappointed I wasted my time and gas! And lastly the customer service?!......I can't even give them credit there. The girl behind the food counter is very unpleasant and unwelcoming.....it's like your bothering her! The girl at checkout was getting her Jack in the Box on instead of focusing on her job?! I was just happy to get my red pop soda and get out of that place!"
"2","I'm giving 4 outta 5 stars. Catfish is the bomb-diggity. Flavorful and non-greasy, fried goodness.\nThey need to work on their customer service and efficiency, big time.\nI called to place a large catfish order to be picked up in a couple hours. Their business phone must've rung 20 times before someone picked up and hurriedly put me through to an order taker. When I showed up on a Friday night to pick up the order, the line inside the store was long, and the service slow and unorganized. 30 minutes later, I walked out with a huge tray of their awesome catfish. I believe somebody dropped the ball and didn't have my order ready.\nThe business reminds me of a Mom and Pop corner grocery, with a meat/butcher department and a take-out counter. Also some tables for those wanting to eat inside. Just don't be put off by some of the riff-raff outside the establishment, and be prepared to wait for your catfish, chicken, wings, and sides.\nIt's worth it."
"1","Food was ok. I didn't care about the ambience."
"2","The whole staff is awesome about always accommodating me and my girls' needs. The Dr. takes his time to explain what he thinks and what he would do if it were his own doggie. My girls love being boarded there. Thank You Ark for always going above and beyond what is expected! I really recommend this place!"
"2","I still can't get over how I paid $2.99 for a coffee and 3 doughnuts! What a deal. I was debating whether or not to go to Krispy Kreme or Winchells but decided on the latter since it wasn't a chain and I could get Krispy Kreme elsewhere... .\n\nWinchell's shares space with Subway which was a little random but I didn't have any problem with it because the woman helping me and what I assume to be the owner were both very nice and sweet. I hadn't eaten doughnuts in a little over a year so I decided to go with a boston creme (one of my favorites) and got a chocolate glazed chocolate doughnut for my sister and a glazed for my friend.... \n\nThey were by no means the best doughnuts I had eaten before, a little doughier than I had expected but it definitely hit the spot. They hadn't skimped on the cream and it oozed out of the doughnut with every bite and I was more than satisfied with my choice. I didn't try the other doughnuts but all my sister said was that it was okay as she scarfed it down. \n\nWould I come back again? Sure, why not. I will probably be back for EDC 2013 next summer so till we meet again Winchells. Keep up the friendly service! \n\nYELP 365: 159/365"
"1","Overall I rate Starbucks very highly so for me to write a below 5 or 4 star review there must be a problem.   I spend lots of money for coffee as this is my only \""bad habit\"" as I like to say.  I know my coffee and I know my americanos.\nFirst, I ordered my standard grande americano.  I lifted the lid and it looked like drip coffee.  Americanos if done right need to have to what appears like a thin layer of coffee froth called crema. Its not only about the looks the crema shows that it was brewed right and the full flavor is in the cup.  I indicated very politely to the barista that it wasn't done right and it needed crema and that I wanted another made.  She had no clue what crema was and asked another barista/employee.  This time while she was not very rude but rude enough she said that\"" if I make another one it will come out just like that\""!  I asked her if she knew what crema was and she looked at me as if I was some kind of a demanding crazy man.  She got back and got somebody else because supposedly I had created a BIG problem.  Now I am feeling uncomfortable.  I asked for my money back since I see an unwillingness to make another one.  The now even newer person perhaps a young on duty manager said that I was yelling while I was not.  I might have spoken louder than normal but it was warranted and I was by no means yelling.  I told her I am not yelling and she said yes you are! She is now making everything worse! At this point I had it.\nIt seems that the cocky attitude that some people in the medical field have like doctors carry over to these employees of since  this Starbucks is located near UMC! WOW!\nI frequent Starbucks hundreds of time a year and like I said I know my americanos. The one near my home ALWAYS makes them right!  \nI called Starbucks 800# to complain and their store will hear it from their district manager.\nI even called back the store itself to let them know whom I had just called.  Granted the person that picked up the phone which might have been the manager was very apologetic and knowledgeable of crema but he didn't seem knowing what they do wrong while brewing these drinks either. No issue with him.  \nThey need to figure out how to make americanos right and be more accomondating  to their costumers and not making one feel bad if all their asking is for a better drink!"
"1","Updated:  they simply can't get their Americanos done right even with complaints and no I am not picky. .   After a few visits with no better results they get a one star review at best"
"1","Horrible horrible waiting time! The appointment was at 9:00. I waited for one hour and 20 minutes in the waiting area, which was a madhouse. I had to be taken into multiple rooms, 3 different waiting areas and I was there for almost 4 hours. The eye doctor was decent enough but the office is clearly overbooked. There were many unhappy patients complaining about the time wasted waiting."
"1","Horrible!! Waited 2.5 hrs and with an appointment. They forgot about us, I had to go remind them we were sitting there. Staff is rude and have an attitude when they talk. I will never go there again and won't recommend it to anyone."
"2","I've been buying furniture from Colleen for 15 years.  As she grows, her selection gets better and her prices are still low."
"2","I love my daughter's coaches. Especially when they let me know she isn't doing what she's suppose to do.  My daughter has been doing gymnastics since 2 and this is my favorite spot so far."
"1","This place deserves no stars.. This is one of the worst places to get your nails done or any service. Its very dirty,the workers are rude, they talk crap on front of you. I know a few words and slangs and I told the lady I understand what your saying..."
"1","So, I pretty much go here every time I'm in Vegas with my incredibly large family, and this is because it's probably one of the cheapest buffets around.\n\nPrices vary depending on age and height (or something like that).  Unfortunately, I didn't pay much attention to the prices because I didn't have to pay.  Har har.\n\nLet's see here ... the food is pretty good I guess.  Nothing extraordinary and nothing that disgusts me.  I'm a vegetarian so there weren't many options for me.  I ate the Chow Mein, Saunteed Mushrooms, Fried String Beans with Garlic.  Furthermore, a couple of chocolate strawberries, fruit, and pastries. All of those were okay.  It didn't blow me away ... at all.\n\nThe place looks rather nice outside; I wouldn't say the same for the inside.  It doesn't look too clean.  Actually, I can put up with the look, but it's not exactly attractive.\n\nSo to sum things up; it's average. Call it a plain jane place if you want."
"2","Payed when entering and was seated very quickly. They asked us what we wanted to drink and we were off to get food.\n\nStill has the best asian food around the Vegas area. Good prices compared to the buffets at the casinos and the food is really fresh and flavorful. They have a lot of vegetable options, seafood options and meat options. They have a wide range of sushi options and even serve sashimi. The fish is very fresh. Mongolian bbq prepared in front of you, and you get to choose what you want in it. They even have short ribs, which is a first ive ever seen for Mongolian bbq. \n\nI noticed as i was leaving however, that they seated the Asians away from the Non-Asians. haha that was funny."
"2","I like this place. It is quite authentic and I know authentic, trust me.\n\nOkay, they have some of the funky things fo the Western palate, but they have geat Clams, steamed fish, ox tail soup, and fried frog legs. You gotta be geat to have this stuff, and this place is one of my favorites to go to when I can't make it downtown.\n\nLots of Asians dine here, which means it is good."
"1","I did not like eating here! Food was below-average quality. Sushi had no flavor - the only thing you can taste is the mayo sauce they squeeze all over ALL of the rolls. The Mongolian BBQ has no flavor (there's no sauces for you to choose like at a real MBBQ joint), lots of fried food (cheap), what fresh fish they did have (shrimp) I just didn't trust. Service makes you feel like you're an imposition. Signs all over the walls about the ramifications if you waste food. Jeeze. Never going here again. A friend talked me into going... next time I PICK THE RESTAURANT."
"1","One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool"
"1","Crappy customer service stay away!!!!\nThese people are d o rude and try in any way to make an extra buck! You can barely understand what they are saying and are fast to shut you up! The waiter rushes you! Food is okay but the staff really make this place suck!"
"1","Fired my pet from services but did it in a unprofessional and confrontational way that hurt my feelings."
"1","I wish I could give a zero star rating. Last night I brought my daughter to Barnes & Nobel to pick out a book. I've been coming to this location since it opened in 2001. In the last year I've noticed the book selection is getting smaller and smaller and the toy selection (and not educational toys) is getting larger and larger. Seriously, toys now occupy 15 - 20% of the store. Rather than go to the children's book area my daughter, naturally, wanted to check out the toys.  What happened to the zen atomosphere of the book store? If I wanted to be around a bunch of screaming kids I'd be at Toys ** Us.\n\nI went to share my opinion with the manager. She was very rude and said the toys sell better than the books and that Barnes & Nobel is closing stores that don't sell toys. \n\nBooks are my thing. I own an iPad, and iPhone, a touch laptop and a Samsung tablet. and guese what? I still prefer to buy the hard books rather than read them on an electronic device.  I love the feel of a book and I love to re-read them. I also spend a minimum of $2,500+ per year on books and magazines.  All at Barnes & Nobel.  But the dumb Barnes & Noble manager could care less. \n\nNote to Barnes & Noble - please do a better job training your managers to be more customer friendly. It would also help to hire managers that actually like to read."
"1","Eeew. Just eeew! If you want some kind of soup and salad buffet, check out Sweet Tomatoes just across the street."
"2","Very good place to go for a quick healthy meal. Even though it is a salad buffet, they also have soups, breads, and on different days extra dishes like spaghetti or tacos. For about $8.00 you can get the buffet and a drink. The bar is always very clean and the staff is always friendly. They even have a \""Souper Fresh Club\"" you can sign up for and get coupons and discounts via email, a $5.99 coupon is what i get the most. I would recommend anyone to Souper Salad."
"1","Terrible, terrible customer service. Me and my boyfriend were in there a couple of days ago, since I needed a new fix spray. I currently use Benefit spray, which is awesome but I also wanted to see if I could get a cheaper brand. Well, we weren't greeted when we walked in, but then again it was pretty busy, so I let that slide. But as I was looking around, trying to find where their fix sprays were, one associate walked right by me, (maybe like a foot away from me) and didn't ask if I needed help, and pretended like she was busy with a basket of items in her hand. Not wanting to bother her, I looked around for other help, but no one except the girls at the hair section seemed available. We wander around aimlessly for about 20 minutes, until  my boyfriend  found an associate who was standing in the front middle section of the store, writing something on a piece of paper. As I walked up to her, I asked her, \""Excuse me?\"" and in the rudest tone ever and without looking up, she says, \""YES?\"" I was shocked by her rudeness, but I went ahead and asked her for help anyway. She then looks up at me with the most irritated look on her face and says something along the lines of, \""I'm not on the clock right now so I'm gonna have to get someone else to help you.\"" She then yells loudly across the whole store to this young man and told him to show us the Urban Decay brand of fix sprays. Though this guy was nice, I wasn't too happy when I asked him if there was another brand of spray that is a bit cheaper and he says, \""Oh, we don't carry any other brand, this is the only one we have. Plus, it's the best one we have and I wouldn't recommend anything else.\"" After I thanked him and he left, I saw the Benefit product section, went over and saw that they had a bottle of fix spray that was cheaper than Urban Decay. I was irritated that he said they didn't carry anything else when clearly they did and was costing less. Seeing as how my temper was getting bad and I didn't want to stay in the store any longer, I got in line, purchased my spray and left. I have never left a business as angry and offended as I was here. And as for the rude associate who \""helped\"" us, I did not get her name but I think she was a manager of some sort. I would not advise anyone to shop at this location unless you want to be met with short, unprofessional and snappy behavior and amateur employees.\n\nEDIT: Actually, the Benefit product I mentioned is a facial re-hydrating mist, but can also double as a fix spray. Nevertheless, I believe the male associate should have shown me other options instead of telling me that Urban Decay was their only brand."
"1","The customer service is horrible, I've been to this Ulta for years now and even though they have a turn around with different employees the customer service hasn't changed. I only keep going because its close to me and they have the best quality cotton rounds to remove makeup. The reward points used to be great but now after they changed I'm spending the same money for nothing. Also, they wouldn't carry over my old points. This store could be so much better, its in a great location and has potential but it lacks the most important feature which is customer service."
"1","The closest beauty store to my house but not a place I enjoy shopping at and won't be going back to. The few times I have shopped there I am reminded why I don't want to come back. You don't really get a sense of an enjoyable shopping experience when security is roaming around and employees are too busy applying their own lipstick or chatting with themselves looking to busy to be bothered. The store is always out of what I need, mainly smash box foundation. The employees don't seem to be knowledgeable with matching and products and are never offering to help me, I always have to ask one of them for help. Each time I shop there, the line to checkout is always ridiculously long with only two or three sales people ringing up customers. I usually wait at least fifteen minutes to find out my coupon never applies to my products. I decided that having an Ulta card is completely pointless and have since thrown away. Try your makeup luck elsewhere."
"1","bad experience in this restaurant burrito was not to my order, had to ask them 3 times why there was no cheese. no refill on horchata at this location and they overcharge for a drink. thinking about making pepes my go to place for now on. also called corporate and they seem to not care. not recommended at all,  beware! !!"
"1","I am a simple girl. I don't ask for very much in life....well, maybe with the exception of a date with Miami Dolphin's player Jason Taylor, but other than that, everything else should be pretty attainable. So with that said,  I would call myself a pretty loyal Best Buy customer until today. I recently placed a special order because they had the best price for my items that I needed. I received a call within 4 days saying that it had arrived and I could pick them up at anytime. I came in the next day to pick up my goodies and wouldn't you know......the bastards lost my order after calling me to say they had it!! As everyone's favorite cocaine addict Whitney Houston would say \""Ahh Hell to the Naw\""!!\n\nHow do you call a customer to say that you have their order and once they arrive say it is no where to be found!! Unbelievable!! I mean come on....is The Cosby Show Season 4 DVD and Expose's Greatest Hits to much to ask for??!! (Yes...you all can laugh now cause I have dated myself....and sorry Diana, you were the one that gave me the original and I have felt a void in my CD collection ever since I misplaced it, so I guess people can laugh at you too!!) It's really not that hard...I was so disappointed with the customer service. Won't be back or placing any special orders anytime soon!!\n\n+1 star for giving me some sort of comfort in my upset state. Beverly Hills 90210 Season 1 was on sale....I guess I could settle with that for a while....and yes...you can laugh once again!!"
"1","Best Buy used to be my one stop computer shop for my Dell laptop in the past. Through my experiences with purchasing my old laptop here, I have learned that:\n\n(1) Repairs are way too expensive here. I was better off taking it to a 3rd party repair shop! \n(2) Geek Squad is not as knowledgable as they say they are.\n(3) It takes way TOO long to fix issues. Once it took almost a month to get my computer back!! \n\nIn general, this location is constantly understaffed and understocked! Every staff member I ran into was just too busy to assist, which was really unfortunate because I was planning to buy a laptop. When I went to find someone to help me about two computers, they told me the differences and similarities between the 2 (they didn't know much), and then I unfortunately found out that the one that I wanted wasn't in stock even. After that, I went to purchase a game for a 3DS and it wasn't in stock either :( \n\nOn the bright side, they do offer special services like overpriced warranties, price matching(thank GOD), and a loyalty reward card. Don't get me wrong, I like Best Buy, but there are definitely better locations."
"1","Staff was rude, useless, not helpful, unprofessional and incompitant. I took my 2 sons their for a hair cut. I went back a couple of times to make sure the number on the razor was short enough while she was shaving his head. Rather than her doing the entire thing over agian and me being unhappy with it. in other words, i was trying to do the stylist a favor. while she is cutting my 6 year olds hair who is also autistic im by his side trying to keep him leveled out cause he NEEDS to stay calm and still,  the stylist tells me to go back and wait in the waiting room. I wouldnt leave my child unattended in a doctors office let alone in a hair salon. Soon after a father comes in with his child (her 1st haircut,) and the manager finally decided to come out from the back to cut her hair after they already had 4 people waiting in line. Then she tells him to step aside a couple time and he's more concerned about his daughter and how she's going to react to a stranger of course cutting her hair and she tells him very rudely to go and stand on the carpet. I'll take my kids, tips and business else where.\n\n FYI \""Precious\"" is no longer woking there and many customer were asking fir her...."
"1","We signed up for sprint a few months ago. The map they showed us said we would have good reception at our house. Not true. Crappy to no reception. Sprint finally sent us a booster so we could get phone service. Still does not work. Talked to sprint several times. We were to get a call back from retention about disconnecting but never got it. For $340.00 per phone, 3 phones, we could disconnect even though they are at fault for lying about the coverage we would have. if you are thinking about getting sprint, DON'T. It would be a HUGE mistake. I tell everyone I meet to stay clear of the worst cell phone service in Las Vegas."
"1","Just a place to get food when you're desperate. Fourthmeal"
"1","I know I'm swimming upstream here in not loving this restaurant, but, frankly, I think that if you're looking for true Thai food, you can do better. The entrees here are simply too sweet to be authentic. Perhaps if I'd asked to have the meal prepared without extra sugar I might have enjoyed it more. I found the food to be way too sweet, way too sticky, and, even though I ordered the curry hot, way too bland."
"2","There aren't very many good places to dine in vegas outside the strip, so at first I was hesitant to try this place out, but I'm glad I did.  It's in a little plaza that usually looks empty, but my favorite pho place was closed, so I tried it out.  \n\nFirst off, I LOVE the decor inside! They put a lot of effort into their ambiance and it shows!  You wouldn't guess it looked this way from the outside and the neighboring buildings.\n\nI haven't explored the menu too thoroughly because I'm just hooked to their green chicken curry! So good I have to it every time I go.\n\nMy fiance usually gets the Pad Thai,  which is also very good.  I believe they offer shrimp or chicken as their meat choices\n\nHe also really enjoys their green curry with catfish.\n\nService is always good.  Staff is always friendly!"
"2","Love Pin Kaow.  We moved to California in 2009 and miss a good inexpensive Thai restaurant in the Murrieta area.  We visited Pin Kaow multiple times and never had a bad experience.  Pad Thai, crab rangoons, curry, sticky rice were our regular orders there and we always got the same, great, consistent food.  We were recommended to go there by friends and have sent many referrals there of our own."
"1","The food is great but the service is horrible. \n\nI wanted to get some food delivered for dinner, so I called the store around 4:35pm and they refused to take my order until 5pm (and then rudely hung up on me). Despite the attitude I decided to call back at exactly 5 to place my order, when the same rude woman picked up she told me that it would be at least 2 hours since they had 4 orders ahead of me. I am not going to tolerate the double standards, horrible service and small portions anymore. It is unlikely that I will return."
"2","Love the soup, the atmosphere, and the Thai tea."
"2","Ahh Pin Kaow. Now I have been going to Pin Kaow for years and the customer service has always been a hit and miss.  The food though always satisfactory.  We visited Friday night with the wonton soup hotpot in mind....because I had been sick I thought that the soup would be good for my sore throat.\n\nWe did call ahead.  Alway recommended because this place gets busy.  It always seems to have people waiting outside on the weekends.  When we got there we were seated almost immediately even though alot of people were waiting-thats why I recommend the call ahead.\n\nWe ordered the wonton soup hot pot.  If you havent had the hot pot before it is a pot with a hole in the middle where they light a running flame.  I would say its for two people but probably could feed four.  The first time I had this I was so impressed.  It just sets an ambiance...an experience.  You definitely must try it.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Probably the best I have ever had that I order it everytime I come here.  I order the spicy at an 8 or 9 and never seems too spicy to eat.  Especially if my BF can eat it.  He ordered the mongolian beef.  It is always great too.  It is different from other mongolian beefs I have had....the sauce is more like a gravy consistency.  But it is good.  All paired off with a glass of chardonney and the night was bliss. \n\nThis is a great place for a date, for a group, for a celebration.  It is a Thai experience.  So if you are trying to impress someone it would be a good spot to take them.  Like I said the service is hit and miss.  I do recommend the take out.  They have a little section in the back where they do the to-go orders and I have never had a problem.  In and out.  Food is just as good as eating in.  This place isnt very close to home but I will drive for the occasional Thai fix! ;)"
"2","What a great meal. Loved the authentic dress of the wait staff. Very friendly and the food was amazing!"
"1","I have been to Pin Kaow many times and the food is very good. However, I went there last night at 9:25pm and immediately upon walking in the manager told me the restaurant will be closing in 15 minutes.  Clearly on the front door it says they close at 10pm. However, the real issue is they should have been much more accommodating to any customer, especially a regular customer. Instead they unnecessarily turned down business. I went to Gaati Thai restaurant right after and they were much more accommodating and have much better food. They also close at 10pm and even though I got there at 9:45, they still set up a table and did not rush the meal at all. \n\nI will never go back to Pin Kaow and will no longer recommend it to friends and family. That is thousands of dollars lost for their lack of customer service and decency."
"1","I was really unimpressed. My boyfriend and I went in wanting pad thai like we are used to finding at other restaurants. What we got was expensive, not anything special, and a small portion size."
"2","Great staff! We had Dannielle and Erica they were amazing!!!!! Thanks girls for being friendly! Food was great as well!"
"1","Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7\n\nfood is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.\n\nNothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy. Pork was kinda tough, beff was stringy, chicken was dry.\n\nNo pico? WTF!! \n\nPlace looked like the person cleaning the dining room went to break right in the middle and left their stuff strung all over.\n\nI would avoid this place-really kinda shitty but hell it's a long ways before anything else if you live in this neighborhood. poor you."
"1","I was really annoyed with my experience here! The guy was friendly enough was was talking to me about the weather and how I was from out of the state then my car failed because my check engine light was on! I was just annoyed because this is the first time I have had a smog test so I had no idea they cared about my check engine light (and the light is only on because of a censor that's messed up nothing that would effect my cars ability to be on the road) that and the guy sat in my car at the very beginning before the test why couldn't he have just told me it was going to fail before doing the test and making me pay for it??! I would have just gotten it fixed then come back but I am not going back there again that's the way you do business."
"1","It was a fast smog check..... But on the banner it says accepts all coupons. I brought a 9.99 coupon from purrfect auto. The guy there says he does not take the 9.99 coupons but will do it for 15!! Wtf! Last time I checked that was an any coupon!!!!!!"
"2","I remember eating here after my cousin's wedding and I kept wondering where they got the fish from. It's Las Vegas, the desert, with no ocean or river currents flowing in or out of the area. Where do Las Vegas restaurants get their fish anyways?\nTo make it better it was my first time going to a Joe's Crab Shack, it was good and the fish tasted awesome."
"2","What a hidden gem this place is for the locals...!  =)\n\n~CHEAP cheap freakin' CHEAP!!!  My brother, G-ma (that's short for the Grandma), and myself ate a fantastic breakfast for $21!  It's unreal, I know!\n~Typical, simple breakfast selections that are right up my alley!   \n~Not incredibly crowded..........  =)\n~GREAT, attentive customer service.........the coffee was always HOT & FULL! \n\nA few side notes.........\n~Don't let the neighborhood scare you away.  I'm serious........it's definitely worth it!\n~The decor is like a throw back from the 60's.  That means absolute shit to me......the food was on point and the service top notch!\n~This is Mayor Goodman's spot.  You might even  catch him here from time to time!"
"1","This small family-owned eatery is a bit difficult to locate as the given address is on N Decatur Blvd, but the entry is on Vegas Drive.  I ordered a short stack of pretty ordinary pancakes while Ann could not resist the day's special, apple cinnamon French toast accompanied by an excessively sweet, sticky syrup plus 2 eggs and bacon."
"1","Worst place ever... Horribe customer service will not recommend this location... I will not be entering this place ever again!!"
"1","I've been here many times and have had minimal issues, but lately it's gotten much worse.  \n#1 They are the only place in the city that does it old style and you have to order by paper by checking off what you want. Instead of just asking the sushi chef\n\n#2 They always only have 2 sushi chefs working at a time and if they get even 5 customers, the 2 chefs can't keep up and when I DO finally get my order, they give me almost everything at once. WHY? Give me part of my order, so I don't wait forever. \n\n#3 They don't make half rolls\n\n#4  I wanted a roll on the menu made into a hand roll and he wouldn't do it for me (and yes it was very easy to do if he wanted to)\n\n#5, They don't carry my favorite item Natto (fermented soybean)\n\n#6 One time they wouldn't serve me uni (sea urchin)  and I saw him with the whole container and I complained to the manager and she said it probably wasn't fresh (I think he just didn't want to serve it)  and now I find out they only serve it on Friday and Saturday because that's when they get a good quality.  (My other favorite place SUSHI MON, has it everyday and always has a good quality) \n\n#7 I filled up my stamp card and they wouldn't let me use it on the same night and told me I had to come back and use it on the next visit. (It didn't make sense and I was pissed because I didn't expect to pay that night) AND they don't include my drink (iced green tea) like SUSHI MON AND HIKARI SUSHI. \n\n#8 So I come back 4 days later use my free meal and my bill should've been about $3 due to the drink, and it was over $6 because she charged me the tax for the full all you can eat meal EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FREE!!  I said how can you charge me tax on a free meal and she said I come there all the time and I should know this.\n\nEven though this place has some menu items that are different and not offered at my other 2 places that I REALLY enjoy , it's not enough to keep me coming back. I'm tired of the excuses, and the little things they are trying to get away with and not really caring about the customer.  \n\nIt's their loss too, because I spend a LOT of money on going out to all you can eat sushi, on avg 3 times a week. I guess my business will continue to goto Sushi Mon and Hikari sushi. Hikari is the only place I've ever known to offer sashimi as part of the all you can eat.  It's a great deal."
"2","We have eaten here since 1999.  There were a few years that we avoided this sushi bar because the food was sub-par.  We started eating here sporadically about 3 years agoi and it was hit or miss.  About 18 months they hired two incredible sushi chefs.  Ryan is one of the two chefs, and he is still there.  There are two things that get you better sushi in this restaurant:  First get to know the owner (thin japanese lady in her late forties/early fiftties), and second talk to the chefs and get to know them.  Ryan is a great chef, and if you tell him what kinds of fish you like, he will make you the most exquisite dishes.  There are a few places that might have better sushi, but they are not AYCE (all you can eat).  I would much prefer to come to Yoko and pay them $20-$25 per person for AYCE, instead of paying $200-$250 for the few other places in town that might have a slight better taste.  \n\nTell Ryan what kind of fish and how spicy you like it, and I guarantee you will be happy."
"2","Yoko Sushi is the best place I have found since moving to Vegas a year ago. The fish is ALWAYS fresh and the conversation with Ryan, the head chef, is fantastic. After the first 2 times coming here he remembered my favorite roll (Happy Roll). It's truly an all you can eat place which WILL accommodate your desires."
"2","Sadly, Fair View Chinese Cuisine has gone out of business. \n\nToo bad because I loved this place. It had the best Chinese food I'd found in this city in the years I've lived here. I was also pleased that the tasty food was so close to home that I could drive myself there.\n\nI generally judge Chinese food on their BBQ Pork Fried Rice, followed by Beef Chow Mein. Both of these items were excellent at Fair View. The other items I tried were also excellent. They had an excellent Strawberry Chicken that I'd never seen offered at any of the restaurants I'd tried in the past. \n\nI miss them terribly."
"2","We've used This company in the past and were totally satisfied.  So when my husband took  a shower in the master tub last night and the tub filled with water that wouldn't drain, and the guest bathroom tub almost overflowed....he called Vegas Plumbing again.  The house is old!  My husband and I were stressed out over our plumbing situation and thinking we would have to break out our piggy bank and then some didn't help.  My husband had to go to work and didn't like the idea of me having to deal with this alone either.  He called around 12:30 or 1:00 p.m. and the office said someone would be at our house between 2 and 5 p.m.   So right around 1:45 p.m. the doorbell rings and Carl the plumber is here.  That is fast service!  Carl worked very hard snaking the tub and checked all my concerns regarding the problem and answered any questions I had.  Carl was very nice and courteous and didn't treat me as the \""airhead\"" wife, he explained exactly what was going on...very professional.  He even cleaned the tub and area in which he worked.   I held my breath as I asked to see the bill and was able to exhale as it was a very fair price for all the hard work.  I hope I won't have to call again....but if I do it will be to Vegas Plumbing and I can highly recommend them."
"2","I like this Baby R US . It is the closest to my house. I only have two complaints. First, it is overwhelming trying to do a registry without a little help with the many baby gadgets there are today. I think maybe they are understaffed but I wish someone would be in each department for some explanations.  And then my husband and I were completely caught of guard by an overly friendly couple (who didn't look pregnant at all by the way) who began to pry into our financial situation only to lead us into their sales pitch for some pyramid scheme. They wasted a good amount of our valuable time pretending to be interested in our pregnancy to finally lead to that a get rich quick scheme. We were a little miffed because we were on a short time frame, not to mention at 6 months pregnant I don't want to waste time standing around. We told them we weren't interested they just disappeared from the store. SO please baby r us if you hear some phony amway people in your store ask them to leave."
"1","The gf and her kid wanted to go to Chili's but I got in the wrong lane and we ended up at Applebees as traffic was killer.\n\nWe checked in and it was packed but my mouth was watering for a Bourbon Street Steak and the 20 min wait didnt bother us to much. Of course I used that time to read the YELP reviews and I should have pulled us out but we were committed.\n\nIt turned into a 25minute wait when we were finally seated our server was over whelmed but very pleasant and after taking our drink order it took 15 mins to get a chocolate milk but I did get my water right away.\n\nThe GF had a chicken salad and two bites into it she bit down and found a BLACK PIECE OF GLASS IN A CHUNK OF CHICKEN.\n\nShe was ok but was so upset she couldn't finish her meal. They took her salad off the bill but really they should have comped the entire meal. It also took the Manager another 15mins to come check on us.\n\nIf something like that happened in my store you should check on them immediately! She then tried to say it was probably something that happened at the plant where they buy their Chicken and not there fault. REALLY? YOU SERVED US THE FOOD AND YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE?\n\n I love Applebees but I wont be going back as long as there are so many other local eateries to patronize. Im sorry guys but this was a horrendous experience."
"1","We ordered hot Potatoe twisters and they came cold. We ordered a bowl of soup and it was small. We ordered a strawberry mojito without simple syrup and it came with simple syrup. They replaced the hot chips with at least warm chips. We are still waiting on the sliders."
"1","RACIST! Against white people or possibly just everyone except black people, I wouldn't go here if I were you, unless you're black and you love terrible food.  Asians, Latin-Hispanic, Native, anything else, steer clear!\n\nSince I've lived in Vegas I've had problems with finding good food, off the strip, that I don't have to shell out hundreds for.  This means that sometimes I go to a chain restaurant, which generally, I prefer not to do.\n\nAlso, I've never before accused an entire establishment of being racist, nor have I ever asked for any part of my meal to be comped until this visit to Applebee's.\n\nIf you are of European descent, I wouldn't recommend going here.  If you are a college student and your writing a paper on experiencing racism, this may be a good place to do some research, if you're white.\n\nAMBIANCE: 2 It's just Applebee's, casually comfortable except for that feeling that if it weren't illegal, you'd be the victim of a hate crime.\n\nSERVICE: Sh*t show.  I hope the f*ck better than they make food, serve food, bus dishes, and manage restaurants.\n\nFOOD: Not sure if this qualifies as food.\n\nLet me elaborate.  I'm a white, female, only parent, to a half Latin, adorable, little, six year old, girl.\n\nOn my daughters birthday I brought her to Applebee's b/c my daughter always wanted to have the staff at a restaurant sing to her on her birthday.  It was a busy evening in May.  I worked all day and was exhausted, so at this point, I was tired, and soft spoken, but totally patient, and reasonably friendly, as you should be to the people who handle your food.\n\nA couple came in behind us, with a child.  They're African-American.  They were seated in the booth directly across from us.  Also, all of the staff that we worked with that evening were African-American.\n\nWithin two minutes of being seated we had decided on our drink and food orders.  Our server came to take our drink order and I informed her it was my daughters birthday.  Then 15 minutes later she showed back up with drinks.  We made our food order and shortly after that the family in the booth across from us were being served their food.  We waited for about another 30 minutes and then they brought our food.  About this time the family across from us were getting their bill and getting ready to leave.  \n\nI ordered a steak.  It was totally disgusting.  It was so greasy my whole plate was like a pool of grease mixed with a little blood.  Every time I cut into the steak more grease would come running out.  Also, it was strangely seasoned.  It was like they took my steak and dipped it in the gutter of the grill, where they sweep all the extra grease and debris off the grill, in between cooking each item.  It was too gross to eat. If I would've eaten it, I'm pretty sure I would've needed emergency gall bladder surgery that night.\n\nMy daughter ordered the grilled cheese.  There is not a grilled cheese this child won't eat!  Except the one from Applebee's on this particular night.  She said it was gross.  I told her to just wait to have them sing \""Happy Birthday\"" to her, and then we would go.  While we were waiting my daughter needed to use the restroom.  We went to the restroom and when we got back our table had been completely cleared.  The busser was still there.  I looked at her.  We had even left my daughters backpack at the table so it wouldn't appear as though we'd left.  The busser asked if we wanted our food back?  No Thank you!  Then the waitress brought our check.  I told her our food was terrible and we didn't want to pay for it.  She checked and came back and said she could only remove the charge for my daughters meal, $5.  That still left a $20 balance for my steak and a beer.  I told her I didn't mind paying for the beer, after all I did drink it, but that I wasn't going to pay for the food.  The manager came over and aksed what he could do.  I told him I didn't want to pay for the inedible food I didn't eat.  He said he couldn't refund it so I paid the bill and left.  I also reminded them that they forgot to sing to my daughter. They asked, after we paid, if we still wanted them to, we both just wanted to leave.\n\nI called the restaurant when we got home and told the manager that if he didn't refund my bill I would go to the manager over him and tell them about our experience.  He said he would gladly give us a meal credit to come back.  I was like \""you're kidding, right?\"".  He said If I wanted to take the weekend to think about it, we could come back in the next few days and eat free.  We passed.  He agreed to refund our balance to my debit card, which he NEVER did.\n\nGo to Outback Steakhouse, it's just down the street and the service and food are way better."
"1","most horrible experience i have ever had at a restaurant. The pasta was very under cooked and the pasta sauce had no taste. horrible unprofessional wait staff"
"1","Horrible and dirty place, this place gave me a toe infection that has not healed in over a month. I dont understand how they any customers. After reading the reviews I still gave them a chance, because it was close to my house and they have alot of foot traffic. Never again will I go here, too dirty to be open!!!!"
"2","This is my third visit and yet again it's like my first time."
"1","Run down, dirty, ghetto, and honestly not safe to be at alone in the day time OR night. if i shop here its my last resort, and i try to be in and out as quick as possible to make sure my car is still in the parking lot when i am finished. Workers are never happy or pleasant, nor helpful. How is this crap hole still standing?"
"1","The sad thing about Walmart is no matter how awful the customer service, the lack of customer consideration, or cleanliness, they will always do well.  Because when it comes to getting the cheapest junk for the lowest price the customers will always flock.  Some out of choice, some out of habit. \n\nOver the run of the last six years, I can count on one hand how many times I have visited this Walmart.  I have visited at off-hours because I could not imagine dealing with them in the middle of the day.  \n\nOne register open for six or seven people in line?  Check.\nEmployees openly swearing and featuring colorful language?  You got it.\nCashiers more interested in having personal conversations vs. assisting the customer?  THERE IT IS!\n\nIn terms of customer service, one of the worst establishments I have ever been to.  One day when I was struggling to carry plastic bins no one offered to help me carry, move, scan, or get them out to my car.  Rather stand and pretend that they don't see me.  And as I mentioned, walking around and hearing colorful language that I shouldn't hear PERIOD let alone at a business.\n\nI don't know WHO their night manager is but they're failing.  Miserably.  Particularly the front end so no matter how great your shopping experience was (i.e. had everything in stock, found everything quickly or on sale...), you have to go through an individual who doesn't care and lets you know it.  Dry, unfriendly, sarcastic.  \n\nI couldn't help but notice last time that they got rid of the \""Did the Cashier greet you?\"" question at the credit/debit card scanner.  When you've given up on enforcing manners then you're really in a sorry state.\n\nI'll give my money to Target or Ross ANYTIME over Walmart, especially this one."
"1","Worst Walmart in Las Vegas. I start itching the second I walk through the door, it's always dirty, it has a funny smell, awful customer service and I only ever go there if my boyfriend drags me in. I have nothing against other Walmarts. I enjoy going to other Walmarts. Just not this one."
"2","Happy birthday Mom! We decided to have a pancake breakfast together here. The location is prime because it's near the freeway so if you were low on funds, you can hit the highway! Hahaha jk, don't do that! We were seated quickly and the restaurant seemed a little busy but our server, Claudia, approached us and asked what we wanted to drink. She seemed a little under the weather, but I can understand that. It's raining in Vegas. How many times does it rain here?! 3 times a year? I'll give her a break. We told her it was my \""younger sister's\"" birthday and we got a laugh out of her.\n\nAYCE is the key phrase for this month it seems. $4.99 for AYCE pancakes but if you order a meal from the AYCE menu, it comes with your meal! The pancakes are fluffy and my eggs came out over medium-- just how I ordered them! And it came out faster than I thought! Crispy bacon, flavorful sausage and crispy hash browns! For IHOP, they really give you your money's worth in food and a little more. I'm sure if it wasn't soo gloomy outside, our server would've been a little bit more chipper, but oh wait! Something I didn't know they did at IHOP at all! The servers were huddled in the kitchen area and our server, Claudia, was holding a bowl of ice cream topped with whip cream. And the lead server yells, \""There's a birthday in the house!\"" And I totally forgot we told her it was my mom's birthday! How awesome! It was really a pleasant surprise for my mom and us. Kudos to IHOP's servers and hostess for making my mom's birthday breakfast an awesome one! Happy eating! :)"
"1","The worst ever,I no kidding the worst customer service ever and only about half the time is pizza up to papa johns standard .why corporate has  not  for stepped in to totally clean house is amazing,years ago I quit calling them because they would instantly ask you to hold no matter what time of day you called them, not ever minute of day are they that busy,couple of years go by and  i thought  maybe corporate  came in  replaced the entire staff due to all the negative reviews on yelp and I do. Love papa johns pizza when it's done right so I thought I would give them a second chance since I was going to next closes papa  johns for years on boulder highway, so call in a  order using a coupon issued thru a flyer that states its for carry out only but not an online since some of the coupons do state online only but not this one which I had to argue with the call taker then he said he did not recognize the promo code at all,asked to speak with the manager he was the manager, great job job of corporate over sight guys.this one store could run the whole franchise into the ground."
"2","Shuttling between old apartment and my new place here in Sunrise, we had to have breakfast takeaway, and I was pleased.  Delicious. The breakfast burrito was all the fuel I needed for a day of packing and moving. Now that we are solid residents and I have tried other Mexican eateries in the area, I must say, the quality of the cooked meats is levels above the other guys. The carne asada burrito my husband had was made well and I was happy to see that the carnitas in mine was still recognizable as pork. I abhor meat cooked or charred to a tasteless jerky.  I also love that the condiment bar was kept well. The pickled onions are AMAZING and carrots are a necessary accompaniment."
"1","This used to be one of my favorites restaurants,not anymore, the last couple of times that I visit this place the eating experience has been terrible. From poor service to mediocre food. I will defenitely will remove this place from my reaturant list. is not worth the money."
"2","I've stopped by here for retro games many times. Good business people, know their stuff. Thankfully I have never needed a game system repaired but this would be my first call. Highly recommend."
"1","This one is only visited out of convenience- meaning it's a quick trip in and out (when are we here, on this side of town? when we go to my MIL's house for dinner), but I don't really like this one. I could probably blame the area as a whole- the Wal-Mart (really ghetto) and 99 Cents Store (very ghetto- in fact, I could probably say that I hate this one- actually had a verbal altercation with a foreigner, maybe Russian- have not been there since). The parking lot is way too busy making it hard to get out of your parking space if you're parked right in front of the store. Also, many of the people shopping here seem, downright weird. This store doesn't have everything you're looking for, either, seems lacking."
"1","We came in from out of town and got our 5 month Jack Russell Terrior \""weezie\"" groomed. She was barking up a storm not being a happy camper, but I figured she needs to learn. I was told to pick her up in a couple of hours. Two hours passed and she was not ready, I was told to wait 45 more minutes. When she was ready, Weezie was very calm. The groomer said she finally got used to the groomer. I took her home and an hour later she had a seizure. I immediately called the groomer and they said that sometimes a puppy could have a seizure if it was really stressful, but to watch her and bring her in the morning if she has another. The store was closed when Weezie had her second seizure. She had them all night one every hour. In the morning I called Bansfield and told them what happened and they said to bring her right in. When I got to Petsmart there was the tech that handed me Weezie. She told me she saw that Weezie had a seizure and told her supervisor Melissa. So when I got to Bansfield, I spoke with the receptionist and she said that Melissa came and asked her if puppies could get seizures. Being a receptionist she did not get the doctor she instead told Melissa that puppies do not get seizures. This was all new information to me, no one informed me of the seizures until then. I went in and spoke to the doctor and asked what is going on, my dog was fine yesterday and today she is having a seizure every hour. I questioned the care that was given at the groomer, possibly got dropped or she could of eaten something. The doctor said no, it looked like distemper, and was beyond what they can do at Bansfield. So I was referred to another hospital which we went and they wanted to hospitalize her and try to treat her with more medication. I asked if they could give her medication so we could get home. They did. This morning we went to our vet by our home. Her respiratory had been compromised and the seizures had taken its toll on our poor Weezie and there was nothing they could do but she could go into ICU somewhere else but that would just buy a little time. The doctor said it was way too late and she would probably not survive. So we put her to sleep. She was only 5 months old.\nWord of caution. Know where your dog is when they are getting groomed, Petsmart takes them behind closed doors. I found out they have a cage where they put the dogs in to be dried. The techs do not use their judgment on warning you if something has gone wrong to your pet, as what happened in our case. Take your pet to a less of a over crowed environment. You never know, it can happen to you! I no longer have a happy little puppy named Weezie and I do blame Petsmart as part of the problem my little puppy had."
"1","This is literally the closets retailer to my house so I'm in here probably once a week. I pretty much go there to buy a few necessities and a 12 pack of soda or what have you and pretty much every time I leave hating that place even more. First off, the parking lot is a total clusterf*ck. The front of that store is a damn near death trap. There's always a ton of people trying to cross the one lane in front of the store that's barely two cars wide. Then you always have cart collectors pushing carts everywhere and even if they have full time cart gatherers, there's always carts EVERYWHERE! \n\n   I think this is the oldest and smallest Wal-Mart in Las Vegas and it pretty much shows. I think the population has since exploded from the time this place opened to now, and this store is not equipped for it. Plus this area is pretty ghetto and there's always a few bums standing in front of the store asking for change and there's always that one family with 5 kids that make going to Wal-Mart a field trip and clog up the already congested aisles.  \n\n   The selection here is pretty basic. They don't have a full grocery section so you're pretty much left with all packaged stuff like chips, sodas, breads, canned stuff and cereals. The electronics section is pretty basic also. The got a wall of tvs, a small case of 3 laptops they might be stocking, three or four cases for the games, one aisle of dvds, and they don't seem to have a designated blu-ray section. The only Blu-Rays are usually in a display stand outside of the electronic section. Clothing, men's clothing to be exact, is pretty bad. They pretty much have a few basics like khakis, polo shirts, and some athletic stuff but that's pretty much it. I remember I wanted to buy some wife beaters once and I went to the section and couldn't figure out whether or not they even carried them. I remember it looked like there was some Haynes display and they broke that down and just threw them on a shelf with no prices or anything.  \n\n   I usually try to go to the self-checkout when I'm there but those usually take as long as going to a regular line. It usually because people freakin' try to ring up 75 items at the damn self-check, and half the time people don't know how to use the damn machine. \n\n   Customer service is non-existent, but it's Wal-Mart and you should expect that by now. If you want to go to a Wal-Mart, go to any one but this one. Really, the only people that go to this one are people that live near by it like myself."
"1","NOTE**\nThis review is only for the Pharmacy.\n\nBeen here to this pharmacy a couple of times because it's closer to my house when i needed it. I always get the same rude customer service with pharmacy technicians. One time i was here, my bf dropped his prescription for his eyes that needs to be taken non-stop daily. The pharmtechs told us to come back the next day after they call us.\nSo we actually received 3 calls from them telling us to come back and pick the medicines up.\nSo we came back the same day we received the calls only to find out that their pharmacy's computer system was down. And waited a good hour and it wasn't fixed still. We had to go because my bf has to work.\nWe went back the next day to finally pick it up at exactly 9am (pharmacy opens) and they were still closed. There was a long line waiting for them and they opened 10min after. Guess what?! It wasn't ready yet!! And then their bitchy pharmtech girl was staring at us with a WTF look and said \""well you gotta talk to the pharmacist, there's nothing we can do about it.\"" Well she needs to figure it out. She is totally LACKING customer service. It was early in the morning and she was trying to ruin it. What if i had a heart problem and i need my medication right away?! Gah. This place is giving us too much hassle. DEF NOT GOING BACK HERE, and i don't recommend it to people too."
"1","DO NOT GO HERE... A THIEF WORKS HERE.  I went in for a normal haircut and when I went to pay, Anna, the hairdresser informed me she would not take my $100 bill.  That is all I had on me so I left her with my ID and a $100 bill so that she didnt think I was running out.  I broke my large bill next door and came back within 5 minutes.  She told me I never gave her any money and tht I still had to pay for the haircut... I called the cops while she called her manager who told me over the phone that \""no one steals money that works for her\"".  And the police told me I could take her to civil court....  I learned a lot today.... Anna from supercuts is a theif and the police don't help citizens....I'm hoping karma will take care of Anna in the best way possible.  P.s there was no sign stating they don't take larger bills. This is the super cuts at 135 nellis, next to petsmart."
"2","My husband come here every week.... the staff is friendly and always on point. Miranda and the other bartender girl are amazing. I would suggest you give them a try. I'm so in love with the 9oz  steak..."
"2","This place is amazing the bread is so fresh. We had a sandwich combo there and it was great then took home a loaf of banana nut bread and wow so good. Also they give you samples so we tried the caramel apple bread and that was addicting. Also the Irish soda bread and peperoni bread was great also. Definitely a place to check out, there's 2 locations."
"2","We have received EXCELLENT care at VCA Nellis. Dr. Roehr is a very caring and profressional Veterinarian.We treat our dogs as if there were our children, giving them the best care possible is paramount. We have found it here at VCA Nellis."
"1","Yelp says:  Blueberry Hill Family restaurant...The sign on the business says:  Blue Skillet Family. Restaurant.  I went in to try the Chicken Fried Steak which I was hungry for.  The place appeared clean and was not busy.  The counter area had a sign saying it was closed and I was told by a busboy to set anywhere I'd like.  I picked a booth but the seat was so close to the table, I moved to another booth and it was even worse.  I am a big person (3XL) but had to sit in the corner table where there was a chair.  Like I said I'm big but the tables could have been smaller in the booths to make it comfortable.  My waitress came to wait on me immediately.  I asked if they had Chicken Fried Steaks, which they did but was hard to find on the menu ($11.99)  I ordered the CFS and asked if they had Texas Toast.  She had never heard of Texas Toast so I ordered the Sour Dough Toast.  The CFS came with two eggs, cooked the way I ordered them (Over Easy) and \""hash browns\"" that were cut like the egg noodles you get with chicken and dumplings.  The potatoes were under cooked and tasted raw.  The sourdough toast was as hard as croutons, and not to my liking.  The CFS was not something I'd order again as it was the generic frozen kind and had no flavor whatsoever except for one bite in the middle, which I can't for the life of me, figure out why there was flavor in that one area.  The diet coke was $2.59.  The total was $15.00 for the meal and I tipped $2, which made my dinning experience $17.00 for a meal that I wouldn't be happy with even if it was half the price.  I did see other customers ordering sandwiches, that did look appetizing and thought maybe CFS just arn't what they are going to be noted for.  I don't like to give bad reviews, but I do think every meal should have something memorable to make you want to return, however, I did not get that experience during this encounter.  My advice is, good luck eating at the Blue Skillet."
"2","I used to drive by this place for many years and finally stopped by yesterday. CAN YOU SAY AMAAAAAAZING?! From the authentic Laos decor on both the interior and exterior to the great service, I can not say enough good things about this place! Being a small, what looked to be family owned, restaurant; I expected good service and food from the jump. Lao Thai Kitchen surpassed all of my expectations... by far! The food here is delicious(especially the $6.99 lunch buffet). I highly recommend this restaurant if you're feeling Laos/Thai food for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
"2","The third, and most humble Big Dogs.  This pub chain is more than just a bar, it is one of the best breweries in the state, if not the country!  The sandwiches are great here, particularly the Philly Cheese steak.   Of course, what is a cheese steak without a microbrew like Dirty Dog, or my favorite, Alpha Dog.  The beer is what is special about Big Dogs!\n\nOut of all of the Big Dog locations, this one is the friendliest.  The downtown area doesn't have a lot of outstanding Las Vegas attractions, but this one of them.  Try the cheese curds, they're awesome!  And if you happen to be on the up and up with the beer revolution in America, than you need to see what Vegas has to offer.  Big Dogs brews my favorite beer!"
"1","I got a coupon for an oil change.  Talk about bait and switch.  It offered $19.95, but after giving me sort of ridiculous excuses, the charge for my beetle was going to be $39.95 !!!  And they said it used 8 qts of oil (I wonder where they would put it !!).  I guess their bankruptcy has inflated their costs....  I told them not to bother sending me coupons anymore and wasting my time."
"2","We have been here a few times and each time was a pleasant experience. Now, we've never been through the drive through which apparently catches hella flack on here lol but the service inside isn't bad. The place is clean. Bathrooms were clean. This is always a wash you're hands after type of meal. Out of all the fast food chicken joints Popeye's is the best imo especially their red beans & rice and their tea. I also like their biscuits and the fact that the food is always hot."
"2","Munch a Sub makes me want to munch on a sub.\n\nWhat I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal. \n\nWhether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.\n\nYou can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They have like 30 options to chose from when it comes to their lunch menu.\n\nWant something local with a lots of flavor? Then this is must do for you."
"2","I cannot say enough about how much I love this place! First of all, the service is fantastic. These ladies are always friendly and accommodating. It's nice to see a familiar smiling face at lunch. Secondly, the food is delicious - and you get A LOT of it. I can never eat an entire sandwich for lunch, so I always have some to take home for dinner. Crab salad sandwich and the #19 (ham, salami, and capicola) are my favorites. For a few extra dollars, you can make it a combo with chips and a drink. While others may give you small sides, this place does not skip out. Large bag of chips and a huge drink. Definitely the most bang for your buck. I remain a devoted sandwich follower of this place!"
"1","Went in there this morning. The lady spent barely 10 minutes on my hair...it was a disaster. I asked for a low faded and she shaved the whole side of my head with a 1. I don't care if it was a 13 haircut, I ended spending another 23 bucks getting it fixed at the barbershop/salon on the other side of the shopping center. (I should've went there first, but didn't know about it). But if you want a real haircut...don't go here. Paid $13 for an embarrassing haircut."
"2","The nail technicians here are awesome! They are friendly, clean, efficient  and do a great job. We (my mom and I) hate spending $100 for two mani/pedis when they do a horrible job and for once were happy due to yelpers! This is a must stop for pedicures. I would suggest making an appointment before going."
"1","This company is a complete joke, total bait and switch. I booked our airport transportation 9 days ago (for service in a few weeks) & received confirmation.  It was their advertised $45 limo to hotel service, yet they sent an updated confirmation today for $100?!!! I emailed to question it only to be told that they were sold out and booked us with a \""sister\"" company.  For TWICE what I booked it for???  I asked them to honor it or cancel is and I would leave negative feedback, clearly they don't care about customer service."
"1","Awful! This location closes at 1am, or so thy say. Showed up at 12:50 tonight and waited, said hello a few times, two cars in parking lot and no response. Guess they close at 12:50 and not 1 as advertised. Have some respect for your job, because there are plenty of people that WOULD appreciate it!"
"2","If you're looking to stay somewhere to feel at home in this is the perfect place. It's clean, friendly staff, & beautiful. It's close to the strip, but far enough away to enjoy your Vegas stay."
"1","**Review only on the Horchatta***\n\nCame here drunk one night during our spring break vacation. It was kind of hard to find since our GPS lead us to an apartment complex. We finally managed to find it after we got out of the apartment complex...it's literally in front of that and next to a gas station. \n\nWe went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.\n\nMy horchata was cheap and delicious...very refreshing and cinnamony. It was a little to sweet for my liking so I couldn't finish it all but it was still pretty good."
"2","After finding out me and a group of my friends were unable to board a plane heading back to SF, due to the plane being downsized and due to there being no flights that would go out till the next day in the morning. The airline picked the hotel we were to stay at and we  were comped for a one night stay here. \n\nAt first I thought, \""Great, now they're going to make us stay at a crappy hotel,\"" but when we arrived I was surprised and glad that it wasn't what I had originally thought it to be! We walked in and yes it is small but it's super cozy. We walked up to the front desk and the woman who helped us check in was really nice, she informed us of when our shuttle back to the airport would arrive, thanks! I was surprised she wasn't overwhelmed by the amount of people who probably came to check-in pissed off or irritated due to the airlines BIG mistake.\n\nWhen we opened the door to our hotel, it wasn't gross or deathly looking. It was really cute and cozy and the couch wasn't disgusting, it looked really clean! We were so glad to see that they had an exercise room, because after dealing with the whole airplane ordeal we needed to blow off some steam. The exercise room wasn't big, they only had a few machines and free weights. \n\nOverall I enjoyed my stay!"
"1","The pizza was burnt. Not \""a little burnt,\"" either. One side of the crust was black."
"2","Despite being taped to the 7-11 next door, border between the two easily blurred and at first sight can make one cringe, it's pretty solid.  Staff was friendly enough at 7 in the morning.  TV on full blast in competition with Spanish radio station was interesting-- suppose it gets people in and out.  Salsa bar was shot to hell and in need of makeover--scared to touch it.  Mixed breakfast burrito was tasty."
"2","I'd give them more stars if I could. I can't tell you how many times I've been in here (a 20 year old car will do that to you), but it's always a pleasure. Surprising, I know! James and Nicole are not only nice, but superbly knowledgeable and caring. \n\nI first heard of them from my Fed Ex guy- he positively raved about how great they were. I finally gave them a try when I bought a used Honda Accord. They did a bunch of work on it to get it in tip top shape since it had been sitting in a garage for a long time. \n\nShortly after, we encountered some additional unrelated problems, and they accommodated us so quickly and for such a reasonable price I was ecstatic. Every time we've gone, we've feared the worst, and it's always been reasonable and fixed correctly. I love that James always explains everything and shows us the old parts.\n\nI have a limited knowledge of mechanics and always used to do basic repairs at home when I lived in California, so the thought of coming to a new area and finding a new mechanic made me really uneasy. I love knowing that now I have a reputable shop that would never try to pull one over on me. In fact, it makes me want to only have an Acura or Honda (since that's all they work on, to my knowledge)."
"1","So, apparently there are new owners and it is now called Happy Wok.  I would always get Cheng's Express and it was fast and tasty.  I called to place a delivery order last month, Aug  2014 and was told all the delivery people were out of the country.  So I called today, 9/14/14 and found out there is a new name and new owners.  The food took twice as long to get delivered and tasted....  well, there was really no taste..  Bland and blah.  I will morn the loss of Cheng's Express and let Happy Wok go on it's happy way."
"2","Update: they sell their goods at Mario Batali's Market on Thursdays and fresh52 market on Sundays in Henderson. They don't sell their bread at the location listed above.\n\nThe Skinny: oh my god... white chocolate-cinnamon brioche (5).\n\nBought a white choclate-cinnamon brioche loaf today for $9. I never thought I'd say this but it is worth every penny. The smell of baked cinnamon goodness just wafts within 10 ft of the loaf. It's a lighter brioche than what I'm used to, but still really good.  I also suspect it will make killer French Toast.\n\nAlso got a nice multigrain-cranberry batard for $4 but gave it away to a friend. (Let me tell you, she's a great friend or else I would have kept it for myself). Will have to try this next week."
"2","While reminiscing about food and drink in Europe, one of my colleagues at the office mentioned Bon Bakery in Town Square and its artisan breads.  It warranted a visit, so I ventured out...........and, oh, what lovely discovery!  A quaint, little shop just like in Europe (yes!!!), very clean (yes!!!), and save for some jars of fruit spreads, stocked with nothing but a myriad of specialty breads (yes, yes, yes!!!).   I did not get there before 4:00pm in the afternoon, but there was still some bread to be had.  Since my family is not into sweet kind, I took home a Kalamata Olive and Feta Cheese batards.  At $6.00 each (vs. $3.50 for a loaf from La Brea Bakery), they were rather pricey but worth it!!!  So delicious!  Definitely not my last trip - this will be place to frequent, especially when in need of good loaf of bread to serve for special occasions.  Great service, too!"
"2","I love bread. That's all there is to it. So when I experienced my first loaf of bread from Bon Breads, it was bliss.\n\nI discovered the shoe closet sized outlet at TownSquare one day when shopping for who knows what. They have a bicycle and a basket full of artisan breads parked right in front. Seeing that really drew me in.\n\nThey slice you up samples of their wonderful bastards. My first was their white chocolate walnut batard. Oh my YUM! It's crusty on the outside and beautifully moist on the inside. When you take your first bite, you get a nice chew that only artisan breads can provide. But then the flavor profiles start to come together and you get a hint of sweetness from the white chocolate, then the nuttiness of the walnuts. Altogether, it's so wonderful that you literally don't need any further accompaniments. I took 2 loaves to go. It's that good.\n\nI go back every other week and have tried their other fine carbs such as their feta bread (nice and herby-packs a punch) and their Parmesan lavash which I could eat in one seating.\n\nThe only drawback is the size of the outlet itself. I love bread and I love bakeries and wished I could get both. Their supplies are extremely limited yet they have a menu of all other types they create. So why not expand and provide everything from the get go. This I will never understand but call me a fan for life."
"1","Here is a summary of what we experienced with Heliocol:\n-Jan 2013- Phone quote- $840 to move panels + $5/ft for new piping (?length).  Heliocol came for site survey Jan 23, but we never received a written quote for total length and price.\n-April 9 appt was rescheduled to April 10\n-April 10- No-show (I waited at home for 4 hours)\n-New appt for April 19 made.  In the meantime, Holly, a manager, confirmed pricing of $5/ft for stronger piping (SCH80) to replace 2.5 yr-old piping (SCH40) that melted from the heat generated by system (NOT under warranty anymore).  That they would install piping unable to withstand normal system working conditions speaks poorly about the company!\n-April 19- Wrong team arrived in AM.  I waited all day for the installation team to come.  System was moved to new location, but piping was not connected.\n-April 26- Installation team arrived to finish job, but gave price of $13/ft for SCH80 pipes- total price for the job was now $2500!  No work done due to pricing disagreement.\n-Week of April 29- after much discussion, Heliocol gave a final \""discounted\"" price of $1485.  This \""discounted\"" price was given due to the company's inability to give a consistent quote, not to mention \""no quote\"" received in January after a site survey.  We did appreciate the lower price given to us.\n-Due to this week-long delay to establish pricing, the next available appt was now May 28.  That is over one month later- with loss of use of pool solar heating, not to mention lost wages from taking time off to be available for them all these times.\n-May 28- No-show (we waited 3 hours at home).  Frustrated, we called and asked if they could come on May 29 or May 30, since we would be able to supervise the work.  They refused, and instead, scheduled us for May 31 when no one was home.  We also asked about some compensation for all this extra time.  We were told to draft an email and they would speak with the owner to \""see what we can do.\""  We received no response from them over a 48 hour period despite 2 emails.\n-May 31 appt- work was finally completed.  Since we were not home to supervise, we have no way of knowing whether the SCH80 piping was in fact used at all.  \n\nHeliocol feels that as customers, our time is not valuable (our installation job was cancelled/no-showed over a 51-day period willy-nilly).  Thirty-two days after the day they were supposed to finish the job was the first available appointment they could give us even though we had suffered so many setbacks due to their poor service.  One would hope that our less-than-stellar experience would encourage them to expedite our job, but that was not their plan.  In fact, they delayed us yet again on May 28 by no-showing.  We then begged them to come in the next 2 days since we would be home, but they refused to move their schedule on our behalf.  It was as if they felt entitled to postpone us because they were collecting $1000 less than originally intended.  \n\nThe email we were encouraged to send the director was met with no response after 48 hours, so I sent him another email on May 30.  His response to me on May 31 was \""I did not respond to your email because I was responding to your BBB complaint.\""  He was too busy to respond to his customer! Ironically, they wasted no time calling us to collect payment.  We received several voicemails asking us to pay for the installation around noon on May 31, before we were even home to ascertain that the job was completed!"
"1","When I opened my account almost two years ago, I turned down the overdraft option. I was told that whether it was a credit/debit or check, I would not be charged an overdraft fee and my request for payment would be denied flat out. I opened the account so that I could have all my utilities auto drafted from my account and was warned that if there wasn't enough money in my account the bill would not be paid and that would be embarrassing. But that has never been a problem so I said I didn't want overdraft. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago. My husband and I had gone out for drinks and when I went to pay with my card, the bartender told me my card was denied. So I pulled out my handy dandy NV One app and I see that my account had been overdrafted because of an outrageous charge from Cox cable. Odd, but I figure that since I didn't have overdraft it was probably a mistake and it would be sorted out. I normally keep enough money in my account to pay the bills for a couple months, but at the time I was in the middle of a bankruptcy so I only deposited one paycheck a month.\n\nThe outrageous charge from Cox cable was credited to my billing account. Long story short, someone else's modem was charged to my account. So I went to NV One to explain the situation to them and have the overdraft taken off and had the pleasure of dealing with Suzy Drinkwine. She informed me that since the bill was drafted monthly from my account that they would overdraft my account to make the payment. When I told her I had opted to not have overdraft, she just repeated herself. Yes the bill is drafted monthly, but it runs as a check or a credit/debit card would so how does that make it ok to charge me a $30 fee? She just kept repeating herself over very rudely. I would've closed the account right then, but since I was in the middle of the bankruptcy, my hands were tied.\n\nThe worst part of the situation is that a utility company that I allow to auto draft from my account screwed up big time and my bank did nothing to protect me. Instead they made it an opportunity to steal from me. What a shame."
"1","Rude service.  They blame all their mistakes on the \""teamsters\"".  Horrible union based company that cannot take any responsibilities for their own actions.  If I had a choice I would never use them again but whats the use in complaining when they already have contracts with all the convention halls."
"2","Still great... huge portions, although the buffalo wings were kinda weak. The chili on my nachos were spicier than the wings. But for all the other goodness, it maintains its four-star rating."
"2","WiFi, breakfast, shuttle service."
"1","Totally Unbelievable......A healthcare company charging $100 to deliver a part especially being that your traveling and have been a customer for several years. They should do the right thing and deliver it for no charge. I called them to see if I could get them to waive the fee I was sure I would be able to get that accomplished and spoke to the branch manager and she was less than helpful and almost downright rude. Kept saying I am not trying to be difficult, oh yeah well than do the right thing and make it happen. Especially for someone who has been a customer for years. We never pay for delivery in Phoenix. She said the only thing we could do is pay the delivery charge or someone would need to come down to pick it up before 5. She had the odasity to say something like if it is that important to you, you should pay the $100. .....totally disgusting way to do business."
"1","Went from the airport to my wife's apartment near Henderson. Came to be about 16 dollars. Handed the driver 20 bucks. When I asked for my change they asked if I tipped. Um yeah 15%. they handed me 4 dollars back and I handed them 3 dollars. They didn't try to take it and said I was cheap as they slammed the door on me and drove away. What terrible customer service. They were even lucky that I were to give them a tip as their service was nothing noteworthy. I would avoid using them if possible. Their customer courtesy is lacking."
"1","This place operates like providing poor service and doing so with a bad attitude are respectively rules 1 and 2 in their employee conduct guide. It is at least nice to know i am not the only person to suffer this joke of a company's treatment.\n\nDear dispatchers*: \""Please do everyone a favor and get caught violating your parole ASAP. You are absolutely not fit to interact outside of prison walls.\""\n\n*Technically, i may be wrong calling you 'dispatcher'...i suspect at least one of you is also the owner-manager.\n**With that said, it is quite safe to assume that the owner-manager is minimally a registered felon and more likely a full-on psychopath."
"1","Picked up from the airport and AGAIN a complaint about where I'm going. Sorry cabbies, I like to hit up Mr Lucky's in the Hard Rock for some chicken soup and a sammie when I get off a long plane ride (yea, typically I'm hurting a bit). \n\n'Hard Rock? Not far!' Complains the driver. He didn't say anything after that, so I'll 2-star it instead of 1, but why are these people such d!cks? Quit your whining. You're back at the airport in 5 for a other pickup. Another bad impression given to any new person arriving in this town. Thanks, Ace!\n\nBonus: He forgot I said HRH and brought me to the regular hotel entrance\n\nSide note: Nicole (who responds but ultimately does nothing to all of these cab complaints), please don't waste your time and message me."
"1","I wish I could give nagtive stars!!!! Please stay away from this place.  I went there 20 days ago.  The doctor gave me a prescription that lasted 3 days.  At that time they drew blood and was told that the results will be sent to my primary care physician within a week.  I just called today inquiring about my lab results as my doctor has not received it.  The person on the phone acted like i was bothering him and told me, without even looking at my records, that it normally takes up to 1 month to get lab results.  i then asked if he could at least look, was agitated by this some how, and said that he does not have time to look right now but took my name and number and said that someone will call me when they can get to it.\n\nAbsolutely absurd!!!"
"1","I really wish I could give them no stars!this is the worse place you could possibly go to.i went in for a dot physical,waited 8 hrs.they kept taking people in before me,that arrived many hours after I arrived.they made me feel like I was a inconveince to them.they are super expensive and don't take my insurance,but I needed my dot and I didn't know other places to go,at the time.stay away,you've been warned"
"1","We booked a limo with CLS based on hotel Aria's recommendation.  We ordered special champagne for an early birthday celebration.  We had planned on taking a trip to the Valley of fire.  The weather was very warm, 107 or so.  We called ahead of time and we were assured it would be cool in the car. The driver showed on time.  We had to drive to another part of the hotel to pick up a friend.  We were in the car for no more than 5 minutes when we noticed that the air conditioning was blowing warm air.  While driving we heard a banging noise whenever we drove over bumps. When we reached the area where our friend waited, we couldn't open the door. The driver was outside and didn't even turn around.  I had to climb out the window to open the door from outside.  Driver didn't notice a thing.  Once we had everyone in the car it became obvious it wasn't getting any cooler. We had to turn around and go back to the hotel.  The driver suggested going on the freeway to see if the car might get cooler but at that point it was hotter inside the car than out (black car).  The manager suggested to the driver that he bill us for an hour anyway but later she relented.  This company is extremely unprofessional.  It is the Aria's company of choice for no apparent reason.  Caution to anyone considering using this company."
"1","The worst!  35 minutes just to leave the damn airport!  Bad product, bad attitude, stay away."
"1","I inadvertently crossed paths with one of the managers at Image 2000 and when the brand name Xerox was mentioned (which Image 2000 does not sell), he became incredibly rude and defensive.  It was amusing to watch a 50-something man start acting like an insecure little junior high school girl who was just told that her rival asked her boyfriend out.  He became so irate at the mention of the name Xerox that it was obvious that he's lost a lot of business to them.  His demeanor alone would certainly drive me away."
"1","The worst ran business in Las Vegas. I needed a scratch on a bumper to be buffed and painted. The man said 1 day....well four days later they are still not done. Here's the best part. They claim to have a \""loaner\"" car. The car wouldn't even kick into gear and is a danger to drive, not only to the driver but the general public. I arrive on the 4th day to pick up the car they said it's still not done and to come back in 30-45 minutes. No call ahead to let me know that it would be a longer wait. Oh yea they only take cash and don't tell you until your car is already in their position. They will charge you just as much as a legit body ran properly so don't waist your time."
"1","Very poor housekeeping"
"2","PTS also has great food!! Not just drinks! I love their chicken wings! I come here often when I dont want to go to a club and would rather enjoy a chill environment with music and a couple drinks. Their pool tabs are a blast when I come with friends and we challenge each to some friendly competition. Great local atmosphere.  You cant go wrong coming here."
"1","Well it's over when they want it to be underwear night 11-to whenever they feel it's over"
"1","If they ACTUALLY  went to school rather than getting their license from some backyard fake bs place they would KNOW that prosisasis is not a communicable disease and CANNOT be passed on from one person to the next. Psoriasis is the FIRST disease you learn about in school. Did they go? No! I'm a ACTUAL nail tech trying to get pampered for once rather than doing the pampering. I ACTUALLY went to school for this stuff. Unbelievable. They told my ex-wife that they wouldn't be able to do her pedicure because they don't want it getting passed to other people."
"1","Others reviews are ON POINT. \n\nMade an appt for 4 o'clock. Was told to go in 15 mins early to do paperwork. At 5 o'clock I was still waiting. So I finally went up to complain about the wait time and THEN they took me in right away. \n\nReally? People can't get service without being loud and rude and complaining?\n\nIf they can't handle their workload then don't schedule so many patients. It's not rocket science."
"2","Dr Brooker is one of the most thorough, patient and detailed people I have ever met. Not just Doctor's. Being a person who wanted to improve eyesight through Lasik technology, it was a process to get my eyes in position to benefit from the procedure. Dr Brooker delicately walked me through this process for several months. he was clear about all the benefits and more importantly risks associated. \n\nAlso something to note, personally I never felt and pressure from Dr Brooker and felt his sole purpose was to educate and guide me through the process of maintaining healthy eyes.\n\nHe's more than a 5 star.\n\nNevada"
"1","Hands down WORST pizza I have ever had. I ordered a New York style thin crust pizza with pepperoni.  Mannn... this \""pizza\"" came out with more grease than an auto shop! The dough was thick and soggy in the middle and the cheese tasted like rubber. To top it off the waitress/bartender said \""Wow! Doesn't that look good?\""  HAHAHA SERIOUSLY?! Maybe she's never had a pizza before, but this was pure nastiness.  My bf and I just looked at each other and laughed. Sorry Nikki Lee's... nice people working there and you may make good drinks, but PLEASE refrain from calling that ball of grease on my table a \""pizza\""."
"2","Hands down what a great experience it was for us. We came in a little after 10:00am and were greeted right off the bat by a very nice gentlemen. He asked where we were from and explained what we could do and if we bought stuff he would have them sign it. So we walked around a little and toured the shop. We then bought some merchandise and other guy took our stuff and got it signed. The General then came out and we took pics and talked a bit. These guys are so down to earth and fame sure as not gone to their heads! We then went into the office for a quote on a tank and ran into Brett. Talked with him a little and took a pic! Great place to visit and made a trip complete! Thanks for a great time ATM!! You guys and gals rock!!"
"1","On our last visit here (Never EVER AGAIN), wifey found a Short and Curly in her crepe.  Luckily she didn't eat any of it yet.\n\nEff you, OPH!   NPH Would NEVER Do that!"
"1","First time I ate hear I went of the reservation and decided to try something different instead of pancakes. I ordered the beef hash stuffed omelette and my wife ordered salami and eggs. Totally different than we had seen it prepared anywhere else. A little warning from the waiter would have been nice. The did had delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. And the hash was good just a lot of crispy egg."
"2","They serve apple pancakes here that are pretty special. It's an innovative baked creation. \n\n\nThen again, this place does things a little differently. Not like IHOP. \n\n\nI highly recommend the cherry crepes.... And I don't even like cherries. They just taste amazing!!"
"2","Great food, good service, it's just a tad pricey for me. About $50 for three people to eat. They have the best crepes in town. Unfortunately, strawberry goes off the menu for the few months that strawberries are out of season. I always come later in the day because A) I sleep all day and B) I don't like to wait. This place is very popular and gets super busy, so brace yourself unless you come later like I do."
"1","Where do I begin . . \n\n\nI ordered a pizza and breadsticks and the man on the phone said it would be delivered around 30-45 minutes later . . \n\nSo after an hour I called to see if maybe the delivery guy got lost or couldn't find my home and the same guy answered the phone and had no idea what I was talking about he then said \""oh uhh yea we uh just got the pizza so he'll leave now and be there soon \"" I had no idea what he meant by that but I took it as he hadn't even left yet  \n\nAfter another 40 minutes I called again and the same guy answered and said \""he left like 45 minutes ago he'll be there soon\"" and then said \""I told you it would be an hour and 45 minutes wait\""  . . umm no he did not or I would have just gone to pick it up myself  . . \n\nWhen the delivery guy finally arrived it had been two hours since I had placed the order and the Pizza and breadsticks were cold and the pizza and breadsticks both tasted terrible not at all how they usually taste  . . bland and just very bad in general (everyone agreed) \n\nand on top of everything else the delivery guy was extremely rude . . \n\nI always order through papa johns and I have for years but this was the 1st and the last time I will ever order from that location"
"2","Love the food. Go here a lot and they are very nice too."
"2","Affordable and delicious Greek food. Try it out as these guys deserve your business"
"1","Some things are better left unsaid."
"1","Just a quick one. The food is pretty good but the service is bad. I have gone 3 times and endured terrible service for the food, every time swearing I won't come back. LOL If you can stand the bad service the food is worth it or maybe not. Coin flip decision at best."
"1","I called Bliss today on a recommendation of another barber that wasn't available for an appointment today. My conversation went as follows:\n\nLady: \""Hello Bliss Salon & Spa\""\nMe: \""Hi! How are you doing today?\""\nLady \""IS THIS ANOTHER SALES CALL? DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT OR NOT?\""\nMe: \""Not anymore\""\n\nWhat a joke. Sorry if you run a business, getting sales calls happens. However, I wasn't a sales call I was calling to become a customer and possibly a repeat one considering I live right next to it. \n\nSo congratulations Bliss, you lost a customer before I even set foot in your establishment. Whoever was manning the phones at 4:40 on 5/15/2014 should take a lesson in customer service.\n\nI will make sure to tell anyone considering using this place my experience and also report back to the store that referred me to STOP referring people to this place."
"2","Great food, great prices, awesome portions. They delivered the food within the window they gave us, super friendly, the delivery guy also brought a 100 count box of tea, \"" stating merry Christmas.\"" From now on this will be the only place I get Chinese food from..."
"2","I have gone here for lunch a few times and every dish I have tried has been exceptional. I always order the wonton soup along with the lunch special. Delicious. The flavors make this Chinese food the best I've ever had."
"1","I had the WORST customer service experience at the Sprint Store on Pecos and Russell. The employees were completely unknowledgeable, and Torrie the manager was absolutely incompetent. They lied about their product, services, and inventory, and routinely tried to up-charge myself and other customers while I was in the store. \n\nWarning: AVOID THIS STORE AT ALL COSTS!!!\n\nI recommend going to a corporate Sprint Store such at the Sprint Store on Flamingo and Maryland, as they care about customer relationships. The \""Sprint Store by Wireless Experts\"" on Pecos is run by an unprofessional staff who don't know their elbows from their sassholes."
"1","omg\nThis is the only place I have ever been to where the server (family help) said they had run out of hot water to make tea. Really??\nBabies crying, i wasnt sure if i was at their house or restraunt."
"2","I ordered t-shirts from them for the Wondercon convention in 2012. I made an order of about 200 shirts and the prices were the best in town with their monthly promotional discounts. So always check their website, \n\nhttp://www.3nuts.com/tshirt-specials.html\n\nThe only catch is you have to write 3 reviews (before you actually receive the merchandise, but you can judge them on service).\n\nI dropped by the offices to look at their screen printing quality and t-shirts. I recommend this so you know what type of shirts you want to get (viewing products online is not sufficient). I'm printing ladies tees, so it was good to see the material, overall cut and length of the shirts. Nataly and the other people in the offices were very courteous and accommodating. The actual screen printing looked great (even white on black shirts) and the shirts were soft and well made. They don't use organic inks, Nataly assured me that no one in Las Vegas uses this type of ink. Something to do with the weather she said. So the screen print inks are a little rubbery. She made me several quotes.\n\nWhen I made up my mind about which quote to pursue, it was several weeks later and when I drew up the order and modified the number of shirts and sizes, Nataly's original prices were different. I called her about the discrepancies and she claimed that the t-shirt prices had risen. I give them the benefit of the doubt, but she reworked the numbers and they were still much cheaper than LA prices.\n\nI gave myself plenty of time, about 3 weeks from the time the digital art was uploaded. They said the t-shirts should be done in 2 but it took them an extra week to print them (hence the 4 stars) and I had them the day before I had to leave for Anaheim.\n\nAnother word of caution is when you get the online proof, be really be picky. I made the mistake and assumed the anti-aliased lines of the small details in my artwork were due to the computer and were going to be fine. When my shirts printed, the fine outlines of my cartoon characters were broken up and lost because of the texture of the shirt. I should have been more wary and reloaded artwork that had thicker outlines. This is my fault. Of course maybe I'm the only one that notices these things. So make sure your online proof is perfect before signing off on your order. \n\nOverall, they did an excellent job on the shirts. The quality of their work and the shirts were awesome. Always give them more time than needed to complete the job. I will definitely deal with them again!"
"1","Even Am Lee has been around for a long time but it is not an authentic  or real Chinese cuisine.Itis more like an American version of Chinese food. Even though restaurant uses quality meat in the dishes,the food taste terrible.I am so disappointed. Apart from that food are so expensive. I do not mind paying for food as long as they are good.\n\nIf you have been to this place ,you can see that not so many Asian person eat there,only American(no offence) love this place."
"2","I have been climbing at NCC for about a year and a half, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time climbing there.  It's not the prettiest gym, but the people are friendly and the routes are good and constantly changing.  Since the new management has taken over, this place has only been improving - the only downside, it's become much more crowded, typically with birthday parties full of kids.  The staff is friendly, laid back, and very helpful, and happy to give advice to climbers of all skill levels.  The laid back attitude can sometimes backfire when little kids or soccer moms with video cameras walk infront of you while you're in the middle of a boulder problem, but the problem is not that common (yet frustrating when it happens).  But all-in-all, if you're on the south side of Vegas, this is your place to climb if you want to climb in a gym."
"2","My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes  I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!"
"1","I  didn't like the selection I had to choose from and the insurance was too high $24 and some change.  I won't rent from them again anytime soon.  They have kids as staff which I didn't care for at all, I would have had a better deal if I went to the airport which I didn't want to do, the return to the other office on Paradise was a better place to go and they dropped me off at home.  No I would not recommend"
"2","Its clean its fast its good food that wont break the bank :)"
"1","This was the worst place I've ever eaten in Nevada. The staff was rude and very unprofessional. They offered a wing club card and didnt have any on hand. They advertised items on these yellow cards which sounded like a neat idea but trust, it was not. I could hear the kitchen staff in the background talking trash about the patrons in the dining area. It should have tipped me off when the only other people that came in besides the 3 people in the room walked in and walked right back out. They asked us how our food was (wings & burger) and we had to be honest. Horrible.I didnt know you could ruin hot wings, but apparently you can. I've never left food on the plate like this before.  I ordered 12 and left 10. I ate the first one b/c i was trying and the 2nd to make sure it wasnt just a fluke. Ah well at least now I know.  If worse comes to worse go across the street and eat at Mulligan's.  see their review fmi."
"2","Sam's Town for a week, comp food so...but Billy Bob's lamb was off the hook, perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, soft, no smell, no off taste, so good..other steaks were ok...pimpkin cheesecake was really good...definite repeat..service is great and not iverly attentive."
"1","sad part is Ive been putting off writing this review for awhile b/c I didnt want to think about it. \n\nBAR: I live really close to this casino maybe 7-10 minutes. the 1st time I came here the bar was kind of hidden behind the Roxy. But we really enjoyed it. Especially the gentleman bartender I want to say his name is Robert or Raul. Well since the renovation we came bk and sat at the bar which opens out to an awesome view of the mystic falls scenery and different colored christmas lights. \n\nMy last visit here was not too long ago, shortly after my bday inwhich my bf gave me a VERY EXPENSIVE NEW PURSE. We'd seen it while shopping almost a year ago and he remembered and went bk to get it. Sweet right? well I put my very new expensive purse in the empty chair nxt to me. . Ladies understand this. . \n\nthe guy kept grabbing my purse and the chair closer to him. so i pulled it back since this made me very VERY nervous. Then he yells at me saying how do you know someone's not sitting there? I said b/c there's nobody sitting there and no food there. so he slides a drink in front of it. after taking a huge sip? wth? really? I ignored him, an hr later and to make a long story short he gets the manager and she sides w/ him and instead of being mad at the fact that he grabbed my purse out of my hands and threw it across the bar - she gets a chair to put my purse nxt to the chair it was already in. \n\nLuckily the guy and his imaginary friend finished cussing me out and left. I will never go bk. The bartender the male and female were both nice to me but neithe rof them stuck for me to tell the manager that no, there was never anybody sitting there and this guy was being a jerk to a local patron. \n\nThe custoemr that sat there after him was so nice and bought my bf and I a round of drinks, so nice. he was visiting from CA and was great.  Sad how you can have both ends of the spectrum within minutes. I cant blame the bar/cantina for the behaviour of this guy but I can blame them for the handling of the situation. Looking back I should have just left when he started harrassing me but hindsight is 20/20. \nI will never go back to this casino again."
"1","Dined here on 5/17...average at best...food ok, margaritas eh...service ok...ambience eh...there's two other similar restaurants that I can think of in Las Vegas that offer more authenticity, tastier cuisine and much better margaritas. Try Viva Zapatas on E. Craig Rd. if you're in North Las Vegas or Lindo Mihoacan on Flamingo Rd. in East Las Vegas. You'll get more bang for your $$."
"2","It was ok.  Was there for Saturday night rib night.  Hubby & I had a 5.00 off coupon.  Really a good deal for the price we paid.  Join the B connected loyalty program for deals.  We would come here again."
"1","We were having a problem and they were working on an RV next to ours.  They charged us $154.00 and didn't fix anything.  In fact they caused another problem that I had to fix.  They recommended that we take it to them so they could fix it.  They diagnosed the problem, however, it was the wrong diagnoses.  Johnny Walker RV took the RV and had it fixed in a 1/2 hour and they only charged us $54.00.  I will never use these people again and I will never recommend them.  They caused more problems and fixed nothing."
"1","First, I'll talk about the Pros.  The Pros are the boarders.  Nicest people you'll ever meet.  Plus, you have miles of open trail riding.  However, speaking for myself the Cons out weighed the Pros.  The Cons are the following:  inconsistency in feeding times (especially on the weekends), stalls cleaned every third day, once a month manure is spread within horse's stall, water buckets are changed once a week on Friday (unless a Holiday falls on it then it's the following week), horses are fed alfalfa cubes twice a day unless specified (leaving a lot of unsatisfied horses losing weight or over licking salt blocks), manure is dumped in riding arena, most of the staff including the special needs individuals lack insight on equine health issues, horses are moved from stall to stall without talking to horse's owner first, the Ranch Owner never walks the boarding area to address boarder's concerns or look at the boarder's horses (personally, I saw her twice in two months and I try to be there at least five days a week) and finally the Ranch Owner's behavior was unprofessional by yelling at me in front of other boarders  She should have pulled the me off to the side and spoken to me privately.  I wouldn't recommend Rocking H to horse owners who are proactive advocates in their horse's well being and overall care because it wouldn't be appreciated at this facility.  These facts are what I observed and experienced first hand.  The Owner will tell you I'm disgruntled and inexperienced.  I'm the first to admit, you can never learn enough when you own a horse.  Information changes day by day and it's important to have an open mind to new ideas."
"1","If you have ever been here you would not have to read a yelp review to know it's an unsanitary disaster. If you haven't been here, I recommend not even visiting because it will make you depressed that people allow their animals to be housed in such conditions. Poor care and abhorred conditions are the standard and anyone who is not content with that will quickly move to another facility. There are many other low cost boarding options on the outskirts of Las Vegas and while they may not be 100% ideal, there is nothing worse than this establishment. Keep your horses safe and healthy. Enjoy your time when you're out with them and have peace of mind when you are not out with them that they are well cared for. Do not make the mistake of boarding your horses here."
"2","These guys were fantastic.  I called, got an estimate and used the yelp voucher which saved me $40 on my service.  We just moved here and needed new keys cut for our mailbox.  They were here exactly on time (wooowwww).  He did his work quick and efficiently and charged me exactly what I was quote over the phone!  Satisfied."
"1","I went to ER with terrible pain on my left side and it could barely breathe... My chest Xray was wrongly diagnosed and i was sent home from ER still in total pain... I had never been to the ER in my life so i went home thinking maybe i was being a baby about the pain.... 2 days later i woke up in the middle of the night in so much pain even worse than before... I told my husband to drive me to the ER and he was like \""Why, they didn't admit you last time?\"" I told him i don't care and to take me NOW.... I get there and they bring me back for another chest Xray and my left lung was almost collapsed... The ER thanked me for coming back so soon.... Shame on St Rose and Shame on Radiology Associates of Nevada .... Now i owe them tons of money .... they almost cost me my life and now they are sending me bill after bill... I feel that if i was diagnosed properly the first ER visit that i would not of spent 3 WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL!!!"
"1","I hate this Von's. I will actually drive to the one in Boca Park, which is further away, because I prefer it better. The Pharmacy staff is horrible and so is the check out staff. I've had to go here on rare occasions and always end up dissatisfied."
"2","This Pizza Hut is great. For chain pizza this location seems to make it like was back in the day. When I order pan pizza it is thick and cooked all the way through. They always have deals as most pizza places do. When they have the deals for any pizza, any size, any crust, I wish they would honor that and not charge extra for stuffed crust. Any crust means ANY CRUST. Okay... I got that out. \n\nThe wings are bomb-diggity! if you don't know about Wing Wednesday then you should check it out. Wings are 50 cents each. I get an order of 8 buffalo burnin' hot (boneless) for $4 and it comes with a side of dressing. There is a good selection of flavors.\n\nSometimes I order for delivery but usually just pick it up since it is close to my home and quicker. I always order online and never have any problems."
"1","I was shocked to see the relatively decent reviews on Yelp as I had a pretty awful experience here. While I don't actually know you, I respect you as my fellow Yelper and will not bore you with the details. Nor will I discourage you from trying Grape Street for yourself. However, I will never consider coming back. 'Nough said."
"1","Over priced. Understaffed. Slow service. Poor presentation of food. After waitress (who was very nice) dropped off food didnt see her again til it was time to pay. Wont be going back."
"1","This place sucked.\nThe chef was standing around in the middle of the dining room coughing into his hands, scratching his nose and wearing a dirty apron. Gross. All this while watching his wait staff run arounds without a thought of running some food or helping them get out of the weeds. He was just texting on his phone or drinking a beer at the bar. Really unprofessional and disrespectful towards his staff.\n\nNow for the ambiance- the place was cute but for some reason the lights were placed behind the fans making a strobe light effect on all the tables. If this doesn't give you an epileptic seizure it will definitely give you a minor headache.\n\nAll this could have been overlooked if the food was good. But it wasn't. Quite the opposite actually. The bread sent to the table was stale and frankly would not have been good even if it was fresh. $40 for some dinky frozen shrimp with soggy breadcrumbs and an undressed salad with dry chicken was unimpressive.\n\nI've been in the business a long time, we go out to eat very often and I am definitely never coming back here again."
"2","What a great girl time. My daughter and I went in for mani-pedi's. I love how they offer their services on a menu like a sushi restaurant. My feet are so soft. I got the CND shellac French Manicure. Kelly was so nice and answered all of my questions. Great job! \nP.S. When we left my daughter realized her toe was smudged so we went back and they fixed it with a smile:). I will definitely be back!"
"2","I am a Starbucks fanatic and I visit at least one Starbucks location a day.  I know many Baristas and I also know they move from location to location quite a bit.  With all that being said, my favorite Starbucks location, today, is the Lake Mead/Buffalo location.\n\nThe staff is competent, cordial, and extremely efficient.  It is one of the busiest locations in North West Las Vegas but they are always able to get you your drink quickly.  \n\nIt is equipped with a drivethru and a rather large out door seating area.   The indoor seating is usually crouded and not the best for large groups.  There are always patrons sitting down in this location which tells you nothing but good things about the location."
"1","The staff here was very friendly and extremely nice.  However, I brought a ring in to be sized of which the jeweler in the back said he could do there.  When he was done I noticed the stone was now loose. I pointed it out and they said they couldn't fix it there they would have to send it to the main location.  I wanted to wear the ring so I kept it.  Then I realized a week later looking at the ring close up because the stone was loose, that the stone actually had a chip in it.  This was not there when I originally brought it in.  I was very upset.  Not only was the stone loose now in the ring, but there was a chip in the stone as well.  Not happy."
"1","This was the second time I have visited Road Runner, the first was about 5 years ago.  My husband and I decided to give it another chance, as it was very late and we were hungry.  The menu was pretty small and there was only one bartender late night to serve us...And I still looked past it all in order to give them a second chance.  I usually don't take too much of an acount into small menus or slow service when it's late night.  My eggs and bacon were decent, my husband's sandwich was ok, and then....later that night....kaboom food poisoning.  Can't usually blame one place, but it was the only place we had eaten together in days, and the last meal I had was a frozen meal from the microwave, I'd say there's a pretty good chance the culprit was right there at road runner.  As if I needed an excuse not to go back.  Too bad, the location was great."
"1","This is an awful insurance company. They lure you into signing with them, they are very kind at getting your credit card number and making you a costumer, but when they call you to collect a remaining balance larger than what the insurance company is able to pay and you contact them hoping that they have an answer, it was a mistake on their part or something of the sort- they leave you hanging and say you should have read everything carefully and called if you had questions. In an insurance company as limited as this one, they should make the effort to reach out to their costumers and one on one inform them of their benefits as well as of their responsibilities as a patient so that when you receive a call from a collection company about lab work that was done to you requested by your doctor who is well aware of your insurance policy, you don't feel like you have been scammed; or better yet you never receive a collectors call because you are well informed of your plan. What is the point of paying for insurance month to month to be left with a bill that is higher than what your insurance will cover? If you didn't have insurance, the doctor and the lab would be very cautious as to express to you the total in numbers of the work you are getting done, prior to getting it done- or simply would avoid performing such work because you don't have the right insurance or money. It's an absolute scam from all parts of the healthcare system and it really is unfortunate that the only liable person is the patient who was played by all parts. Health Plan of Nevada is a scam along with physicians and laboratories who play the game."
"2","Since the Laser Quest in Las Vegas opened in 1998 or 1999, this has been one of my favorite places in the valley to hang out and have a good time.\n\nAdmittedly, I did have a lot more fun playing the game when I was between the ages of 12-18 since it's such a great place to hang out for high-schoolers and middle-schoolers, but I still have a blast every time I go....otherwise I wouldn't be coming back after playing thousands of games!\n\nI can't exactly remember how much games are running for these days, but I will say this. If you like the first game you play and you plan to play a lot, buy a membership. It saves you money every time you play, and it adds up quickly if you get really into it.\n\nThis particular version of the game is very simple and enjoyable for a couple of reasons. \n\n1) There isn't a heat sensor on the bottom of the gun that you have to hold while you shoot. This is incredibly convenient because I like to shoot with one hand sometimes.\n\n2) There aren't any bases around the arena you can shoot to get extra points so you can focus on just running around shooting the other players.\n\n3) There are plenty of targets on each pack to shoot people....shoulders, front, back, the sides of the laser gun and down the barrel of the gun. It gives you so much stuff to aim for!\n\n4) The maze is wicked cool and HUGE. There are three towers you can shoot from as well as an extensive floor space. The mirrors on the walls are also fun to bounce shots off of and sometimes you can catch people by surprise with them\n\nOnce a month, they do a lock-in event from 11:45PM-6AM where you can pretty much play as many games as you want in those hours. It's a fantastic deal and a great time. In addition, they sometimes play different types of games instead of the free-for-all games you get during normal business hours. \n\nThey also have a handful of video games out in the lobby to play while you're waiting for the game.\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't tried Battle Blast yet, but this is probably the best laser tag you'll find in town. Most definitely light years ahead of the horrible equipment they have at the Adventuredome at Circus Circus. \n\nCome down and have fun!"
"1","This Chuck E Cheese's location is similar to whiping before you use the toilet; it's all out of order.  The only reason I used a poop reference is that this place is crappy.\n\nWe came here on Memorial Day with the kids (4 and 6) for some pizza and fun.  The pizza is similar to Little Caesers, and is perfectly fine for kids, but the fun wasn't as easy to swallow. \n\nThere were at least 6 machines that did not work, yet had no out-of-order sign posted.  While this place isn't the most expensive source of entertainment for kids in the valley, nobody should be tossing their money away due to a lazy staff.\n\nThe bathrooms were messy, and the place had an overall dirty feeling to it.  When it came time to cash in the kids' tickets, we waited at the ticket counter for a good ten minutes before being helped.  Do you realize that they have prizes listed for 150,000 tickets?  Can you imagine having 150,000 tickets in a drawer somewhere in your house?  Ridiculous!!\n\nFor the money you'll waste here, you're better off doing something outside with the kids, ordering (or cooking) pizza, and then taking them to the toystore; it will be cheaper, healthier, and less mousey."
"1","I would never recommend Chuck E Cheese at 7381 Lake Mead, Las Vegas NV. I just had my son's birthday party at Chuck E Cheese and it was so disorganized. I hope that my guests did not realize it. \n\nThe party hostess was friendly at first, she got our orders for the kids pizza and adult pizzas. She said, okay i have that you are having 14 kids. I looked at her with a startled expression and said, no I am having 20 kids. She looked at the plates on the table and was like \""oh I guess I could of looked at all those plates\"". I was like, what have I got myself into. There were clearly 20 plates on the table, but she didn't have the correct information. \n\nI never saw the party hostess around until the manager saw me getting my own pitchers and I asked for more plates. I had to fill up my own pitchers after they were empty. The tables weren't cleaned off to the very end. I was surprised the cake was ready for the \""Big Chuck E Cheese\"" show. The other \""party host / hostess\"" seemed more attentive to their guests vs. my party hostess. I am not sure if she just didn't care or if she was overwhelmed with the 20 + kids we had. I have had my kid's birthday parties at other facilities (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone etc) and those experiences were wonderful.  The other party host at (Child's Play, Laser Tag, Sky zone, etc) were always around or if they needed to go on break there was always someone else around. Another thing was the \""ticket blaster\"", she never explained the ticket blaster, that my son FINALLY went in. She said, oh did he already do the ticket blaster and I was like no I was waiting for you. She said, oh that (and she pointed) party host is doing the ticket blaster. By that time, I just gave up on the party host. I took my son to the other hostess who was wonderful. i always give a $50.00 tip to my party hostess/host but she received a $10.00. I don't even think she deserved that. \n\nThe only thing she seemed to be on top of was handing me the bill. \n\nI would never recommend Chuck E Cheese on Lake Mead in La's Vegas."
"2","I've had Dr Mike treat me since June of this year 2013. He gave me 16 crowns and my smile back. He has truly changed my life.\n\nHis office staff has been wonderful and so professional.\n\nHe's the doc you need to correct any dental issues."
"1","Can I start this review with a little emoesque touch.... I am sad... To say the least. I hear from every direction that jimmy johns is #1, the best, the winner, the best looking, best smelling, moi guapo, the sexiest sandwich this side of the Rio grand and for that I say to you all, I am glad that none of you happened to be my wing man in my younger days. This place was T-T-T-Terrible. Pulling up to this joint I was curious if the recommendations would pay off and at first glance I thought yes it would. I mean pulling up to place that has a bright neon sign that clearly says Free Smells seems comical and like they had something up their sleeves. Open the door and POW you are hit with the smell of Pickles and floor cleaner but I can look past that so I take a quick look at the menu and decide to grab a gargantuan, the wife figured you can go wrong with a BLT and the kids would kick down a turkey and cheese. \n\nI know that the order sounds pretty ordinary and seems pretty easy to achieve greatness, unfortunately that was not the case. After waiting in the cramped quarters for our sandwiches we sat down to see what the jimmy johns hype is all about and that first bite was like the moment your parents popped your favorite balloon and all the air shot out of it and you felt completely let down. Okay so that might be a little much and if it felt like that then you may want to be checked for daddy issues but I assure you it was not good. \n\nI was hungry so I dealt with my sandwich but my wife asked me to try her BLT and see if I thought the bacon was no good or something and even though I thought for a second that she was over reacting and in my mind I mumbled, \"" come on Hun, bacon is bacon\"" as I took a bite I began to scream in my mind, \"" What the hell is that, it is definitely not bacon\"". so first thing was first she stripped the bacon out of her sandwich and decided to pull a piece of turkey out of the kids sandwich and transform her BLT to a turkey sandwich in hopes for a better experience but the issue was that the turkey sandwich had only one slice of meat and we couldn't just give the kids a bread sandwich now could we. \n\nI don't want to turn this into a 100% rant but unfortunately to all of you Jimmy Johns Lovers that I know, please warn me before we hand out next time.... I'll grab Subway. I'm sorry was that a low blow, Well sometimes the truth is like a kick in the metaphorical nutts."
"2","Great place tucked away by the lake!  Had a great experience with a tremendous massage.  Reasonably priced.  Way better than going to the overpriced Red Rock Spa.  I will be back!"
"1","I hate to admit it that this was my first time going to K-mart. I've always gone to Walmart, but as I was in the area and just needed a notebook, I stopped in here. I can't say if this is better or worse than other K-marts, but compared to Walmart this place has room for improvement. The staff was super friendly, but I found this place to be as expensive as office supply stores for some pens and a notebook. I got my notebook, but I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm in a bind."
"2","I would recommend OBGYN Specialist to anyone!! I have felt that I matter to them as a person, not just a patient since the moment I walked in there a few years ago.  I recently suffered an ectopic pregnancy and they were on top of the situation medically as well as helping me emotionally.  The \""bedside manner\"" I received was one of a kind and I can't imagine going through this hard time with any other doctor."
"1","Out of all my life, I've never HATED a practice this much in my life. Whenever I call I'm on hold for 15-25 mins minimum. They call me and tell me my results are positive and then they send me a letter saying my results are negative, so which one is it then???? So I call them waited on hold just for them to tell me \""THEY DONT KNOW and that They have to call me the next day \"". Mind you I had my Pap smear January 31 and didn't get results for 2.5 weeks, and the ONLY reason I got my results by phone is because I called them 4 times, but those 4 times they told me they'd call me back, NEVER DID. and come to find out my results never came back from the lab. Then I get a letter 1 week later saying my results are normal. I go to get my medical records from them to change doctors and wait 40 mins for them to tell me they can't get it off the computer because \""they have a new system\"". The staff is absolutely horrid and inappropriate. I only went there once and they have put me through way too much. These people don't care about their patients at all."
"1","I had a terrible experience with OBGYN Specialists. I called in September for an appointment and was told that they only see new patients every so often. I made an appointment with Dr. Reynolds for DECEMBER 8. That's 3 months that I had to wait the for very next available appointment.\n\nThen, on December 4 I get a call saying they had to schedule a surgery during my appointment and that we'd need to reschedule. They then proceed to start telling me available times in FEBRUARY. Ridiculous and SO rude. The doctors might be good but the wait and rudeness I was treated with is so not worth your time and money."
"1","Good doctor but horrible care. \n\nDr. Swainston's office is horribly managed. From three hours waits for appointments,  to \""forgetting\"" to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to \""forgetting\"" to follow up on positive lab test results, and \""forgetting\"" that you are there for an appointment, they are the worst run medical practice I have ever seen. \n\nI understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that Dr. Swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice. But lots of doctors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing. You can never get access to him and it's almost impossible to even get the attention of a nurse. You have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or never do it at all. You have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back. \n\nFor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized, I had to call nurse to get it, called twice without a call back, and finally gave up trying to get the nurse. I got an appointment to see the doctor to try to get it filled, get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake, told me they would resend it to make sure, never sent it, had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized. Why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional doctor visit to follow up just to get one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written properly? Why does it have to take 6 hours out of my life to get one prescription properly filled?\n\nThis is just one example. \n\nI had a surgery with Dr. Swainston several months ago. I had a lot of complications. And I believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not proper care before and after the surgery. So does it matter how good a surgeon is if the pre-care and post-care is crappy? I suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care. \n\nIf you have any other choice, avoid this doctor. He's good but his team is clearly overwhelmed and/or does not care enough to improve the care it gives it's patients. It's just not worth it. It's really a nightmare dealing with them. I am so glad I no longer need to deal with their practice again."
"2","My review is for maternity ward only. I have never been to the er or any other place in the hospital. This hospital gave me the best delivery experience of my life. Each Dr/nurse was so caring and always checked on me and my pain level. One of the  nurses even recorded my delivery so my husband could be included in the video + cord cutting. Food was 9/10. Yes it really was that good!! Nurses were so caring. Thank you MV staff"
"1","Called this location prior to visit, the boy that answered the phone was so rude we didn't even want to go. Food is good so we gave 2 stars."
"1","HORRIBLE!\n\nWe got a late night dinner there and everything was horrible. First, it looked like it was closed. I am sure that the employees do this so people just drive away (I wish we did). Our order was wrong. Cold and super greasy fries. \n\nand the chicken sandwich was RAW! If you think it's a pain to cook chicken late at night because it takes awhile SAY YOU ARE ALL OUT! But never rush it.\n\nThis place needs to either be under new management or torn down. Start over with a place that gives a damn."
"1","Nevada Orthopedic and Spine is HORRID.  I went to the Stephanie office with my elderly mother who needs a shot in her knee of gel to help her walk.  The first shot went alright, but as we came 6 months later to get the second shot, in both knees, the process was just horrible.  We have been waiting for more than a month to have them get the shot for her, she has 2 insurance companies, and still no return calls.  The assistant to Dr. Kestrup Mabel, is rude, as well as condescending to me and my mother, and the other assistant to Dr. Kestrup is Cynthia who does not ever call us back. The patient advocate is not a patient advocate, because she doesn't call you back either.  The office is huge, and has a large number of doctors, who I believe are not worried about the patient, but worried about how much money they can get.  \n\nIf you are looking for an Orthopedic doctor, do not, I repeat do not go to Nevada Orthopedic and spine, they are HORRID. I have called the office over 10 times, and left messages, and no answer.  \n\nThey are not interested in patient care, but the bottom line."
"1","Update: I asked for my medical records and guess what?  Both incomplete and inaccurate!  Surprise!  They didn't do full intake on me during my multiple visits so just \""copied\"" what was there. Also, no radiology reads on 2 of 3 imaging session which means going to another doc they will typically not accept the image, only the printed report from the radiologist.  (Like I was born yesterday.)\n\nI have a call in to them to try and get the records corrected ad to get the balance of the documents all I can add is SHEESH!!!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust when I thought it couldn't get any worse.  A place that treats by the joint when you have multiple joint problems a place that obviously doesn't think about the patient but more about billings.\n\nI called today to find out when my apointment with another doc was.  I called May 6th to reschedule it from tomorrow to another day but forgot to write down the new day.  As it turns out, that doctor only works Monday and Wednesday and only time I can get out of work early are Tues & Thurs which is why I called to reschedule the appointment they made for me without asking my availability!\n\nSo... Dr. Ashman has issued a \""divorce of care letter\"".  Oh gee.  I'm so hurt.  It won't prevent me from seeing the 2 doctors at this practice who have already given me less than 3 minutes of their time but I will no longer be able to go to Nevada Orthopedic.\n\nROFL!  Perhaps Dr. Ashman doesn't realize that before you get a divorce you have to get married and because I NEVER saw him because he walked out on me, kind of hard to get a divorce.... but I did refuse his proposal that I wait longer than the 40 minutes I had already been there because I had my cell phone in my hand when he finally walked in the room.\n\nBTW...when I was in the elevator going down after I left Ashman's office I was grumbling and someone in scrubs asked me what was up.  I said I was waiting for a doc that was 40 minutes late and he got mad because I had my cell phone in my hand (not talking, just checking work e-mails, etc since the wait was so long.... and I told him Ashman walked out and I walked out on him a few minutes later)  Reply for the guy in scrubs?  \""Good for you.  He treats everyone that way\""\n\nJust as an FYI, when I saw another doctor for another joint, he was well over an hour late and while he wasn't overtly rude, the rest of the staff had gone home and he clearly wanted to as well so I got the bums rush with a quick referral to MRI)\n\nIt seems to me that if this place cared about their patients, they might want to look about their process that makes patients wait so long, see so many doctors and allows doctors to be so overtly rude.  Any other place would have FIRED an employee for being such a rotten egg.  MD or not if you hate your job so much and hate people so much... time to look for another job!"
"2","The decor is classic dark brew pub. It works. A nice place to hang with your friends or just chill by yourself.\n\nAn above average pub menu. The breakfast menu is pretty good, with lots of choices. We like it - my sweetie loves to come here.\n\nToday we showed up a bit late for breakfast, so we fastened onto the lunch menu. Again,  lots of choices. I went with the \""round mountain\"" roast beef sandwich,  my sweetie went with the Paradise Carnita sandwich. We both had the home made chips,,, my sandwich was okay -- it was as advertised -- but it was kinda bland for my taste. Not Steiner 's fault,  the roast beef sandwich would be killer for someone with a blander palette than mine.  The Paradise Carnita sandwich was absolutely KILLER.\nSo full of flavor -- an awesome choice,  sweetie loved it as did I.  I know what Im ordering on my next visit.  Pulled pork ( carnita style )  with spicy sauce and pico de gallo served on a sweet sourdough roll. Amazing sandwich.\n\nGood selection of beers - on tap and in bottles. Service was good,  and the prices are fair. Recommended."
"1","Nothing special. Not a great breakfast place and their Italian dinner items are bland. Went twice. Never again. On my second visit we went with another couple that had an Entertainment Book coupon. The staff wouldn't allow us to sit together and use both coupons. (Only one coupon per table, they said, although that wasn't specified on the coupon.) So our friends had to sit at a table next to us and we shouted at each other to have a conversation. Ridiculous.\n\nPlus their highly touted banana bread reeks of artificial banana flavoring, not fresh bananas; and their special potatoes (served instead of standard hash browns) are like thick, hard, and slightly greasy potato chips.\n\nI don't get the couple of enthusiastic reviews here. Perhaps they have a storied past, but for a Vegas newcomer (two months) this isn't even up to a Denny's standard."
"2","I recently discovered this location a month ago and am glad that is saves me a drive from the Charleston location I used to frequent.  Even though this location is popular and busy I've always been able to find a seat with minimal wait times.  I was satisfied that it was clean, specials were communicated on the chalk board as soon as you walk in, and everyone is really friendly.\n\nWhat I really enjoy here is the basic breakfast since it's one of my favorite meals, I got the ham and eggs with toast.  Sure what I choose is a basic breakfast but I loved how it's all freshly made and the ham was cooked well and not overly salty.  I've eaten here with friends who've gotten the \""Kitchen Sink Omelet\"" and various sandwiches and everyone has always left full and with boxes for the leftovers.\n\nIf you're up for a clean, friendly, and delicious breakfast/lunch place with friends I'm sure anyone can find something on the menu.  I've already added this to one of my options on weekend mornings."
"2","Anyone going MUST try the fried zucchini it's AMAZING!! Great service and great food!! The servings are huge!! You can not beat the price. We will definitely be returning and recommending it to everyone."
"1","I was a big fan HOWEVER they closed my location and the new facilities SUCK they don't have all the machines they had at the other location, and the place just plain blows now. The have cheap shit equipment- What the hell is wrong with them, are they trying to be an LA FITNESS DUMP. The new place(s) are loaded with cardio equipment, WTF. \n\nThey need to open a WORLD GYM or POWERHOUSE GYM out here because Golds sold out.\n\nSUCKS NOW, IT'S A BITCH GYM.. Join 24hr fitness and go through the motions there.."
"1","I got a staph infection the first day I went here. I've been stuck inside for the past week because of this... and at 26 I have a pretty good immune system, rarely ever am I sick. \n\nI believe this happened on the MMA mats (could have been the equipment though), the instruction itself was good, the people were cool, but the mats stunk terribly... as if they've rarely been washed. I've trained in other MMA gyms for about a year now, and have never had an issue (where mats are cleaned regularly).    \n\nAt $20/mo it sounds like a deal, but $200+ in meds and otc products could have you rethinking things. Overall, I guess you get what you pay for."
"1","Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink. I was soooooo angry I actually called. The manager offered to give me the stuff if I drove down and pick up the items. There was no mention of a refund or a gift card for a future order. Doesn't matter because I won't be going back."
"2","If you are looking for professional teachers to challenge you, but still have a family atmosphere The Pointe Dance Center is the place! Donna Frias is the owner and has been a complete joy to me and my family for years. She has a lot of experience in the entertainment world and it shows in her studio. They also have competing teams which is a great experience for  kids and teens. PDC competes from California to New York City. They truly make you feel like family after one class!  Feel the beat and head to PDC!"
"1","Crazy high ripoff prices!"
"1","This place is sub par.  The service is great and the staff are really friendly but the food is only edible at best.  My wife and I caught an early dinner here last night.  The decor was dated and the other patrons were all probably from Sun City, but whatever.  We ordered the dinner special which comes with soup, appetizers and two main courses.  We received the wonton soup first which was bland.  Then we got out appetizers that consisted of fried wontons, fried shrimp and egg rolls.  They were a bit greasy but edible.  Finally came our main course of orange chicken, mongolian beef and bbq pork fried rice.  The portions were a bit small and the food was flavorless.  I never had orange chicken and mongolian beef that tasted quite like this.  I mean I have had some terrible chinese food before, but the sauce they used for both dishes were pretty unique.  Again, everybody was incredibly nice and I really wanted to like this place, but my taste buds won out.  I know it's hard to find decent chinese food away from the spring mountain area, but there are definitely better than this(although I'm still searching for my go to place)."
"2","I've been eating here for about 20 years and is my hands down favorite place in Vegas."
"1","Wow-wee-wow! I didn't hate this place; I sure liked it a lot better than the previous reviewer (Tiger W.), but it was rather mundane.... 'ho-hum', if you will. Not terrible at all, just nothing special. Good if you're hungry and not looking for a fancy-schmancy experience. I recommend on those terms. Good price."
"2","I'm pretty much only going to review their beer selection because that is all that concerns me. Lee's has a decent selection. It's the best I have seen so far here in Las Vegas. I have seen stores with better selections in places like Chicago, but if you are a beer connoisseur then this might be the best you can find in the area. Also, they provide a discount if you pay with cash (debit cards count as cash as well), so you can get some pretty good deals.\n\nThere is a Lee's closer to where I live, but this one is close to work so I occasionally  just pick something up on the way home. And no I'm not an alcoholic, I just enjoy fine beers."
"1","Today, two clerks at the Eastern store insisted that \""Extra Dry\"" champagne was drier than \""Brut.\""   WRONG!!!"
"1","I have used this business for a while for my dry cleaning. I took in a skirt to be shortened. The skirt is a gauzy material that is difficult to work with. I went to pick it up and the hem was terribly crooked. I showed them and asked it to be fixed. I went to pick it up again and it's still about an inch uneven. I requested the $15 I paid for alterations to be refunded so I can take it somewhere else. They refused and said the skirt is wearable. I requested the woman to call the owner to request the refund. She called and had a long conversation. After the conversation, she said no and THEY DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS LIKE ME!!!"
"1","This is the second time I have dined at Yummy Sushi.  The first time we dined here it was by chance; we were hungry and we're just cruising Lake Mead Blvd looking for a place to eat.  Had I written the review the first time, I would have given 4.5 stars.  The fish was fresh and delicious. We tend to get nigiri and sashimi only. The server was friendly and the sushi chefs too.\n\nWe had the same server and she is very friendly and nice.  Now, here is where it all goes awry.  We order a couple of hand rolls, it was good.  I love yellow tail, so I requested an order of hamachi nigiri.  The sushi chef prepares it and hands it to me while my man is away in the bathroom.  I look at it and it does not look like yellowtail.  I take one small bite and I can barely bit into it.  On top of that he tried to add something to the fish to make it more edible.  I still don't know what it was.\n\n My man comes back from the bathroom and I look at him and he says \""what is that?\""  I said, \""supposedly yellowtail\"".  My man takes a bite, looks at the sushi chef and says \""Yellowtail??\""  He only said one word with a question in his voice and the sushi chef immediately says, \""oh so sorry I give you better piece, I accidentally give you piece that was bleeding\"".  What???  I have been eating sashimi for 15 years now, my man a little longer.  We know good sashimi.  He tried to pull one over on us and I felt really insulted.  He shouldn't be serving that to anyone, even if they hadn't known the difference.\n\nShame on you owner and sushi chef! (slap on the hand)  I thought I had found a great place to have sushi in town, now I will have to resume my search.  I never mess around with raw fish, all it takes is one bad experience for me to scrap a place.  Your place is officially scrapped Sir!  I know I am a dissenting review and perhaps he was having a *moment* whatever. SCRAPPED!"
"2","Yummy yummy yummy! I ordered the Romeo and a taste like your ex girlfriend roll to go and while I was waiting, the nice waitress gave us complimentary pancakes. The The only thing that got deducted one star is the fried shrimp on the ex roll. It was cold. Highly recommend though! The customer service here is always welcoming and very friendly!!"
"2","Without a doubt, this is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas. \n\nSince Eric, the owner/main sushi chef, took over back in 2008 this place has been FANTASTIC. \n\nAs far as pinpointing my favorite item on the menu...that's difficult. I love the Passion Roll and the Tuna Karai, which is EXTRA spicy here. The Screaming Orgasm is also fantastic.\n\nAll of the hot food I've ever had here has been great as well, especially the Bulgogi Beef and the green onion pancakes. Absolutely delicious!\n\nAside from the fact that Eric is a fantastic cook, he is a very warm and friendly person. I can't count the number of times that I've been having a meal up at the sushi bar and we've ended up talking for a solid hour or more about our lives and whatever sport happens to be playing on the television. He's also occasionally makes me a random roll for free to try out and none of these random dishes have ever been disappointing!\n\nWhile some will be turned off by the fact that this spot doesn't have an \""All You Can Eat\"" option, I think it's worth the extra money considering how amazing the food tastes."
"1","Freshest sashimi artfully presented is near 5*(but the smallest micro cuts) when served by the talented and caring Eric, BUT SADLY the wait for food service here is ridiculously long as the charming Eric tries to personally accommodate everyone, and I mean everyone (Mission Impossible). The waitresses are sweet though mediocre & persistently to pushy with refills (I still have a half of beer left and she wants me to order another??)... if your not careful you will have easily polished off 3 beers before you even get your first order. Typically we wait at least 30 minutes after sit down until first food order arrivals... tastes great, but not fun and no way worth the long waits for food (usually 2 and half hours for a few orders and a lot of beer and saki) and then there's the big, almost Tokyo priced, ticket at the end. We have visited this Yummy Grill only 10 times hoping service would improve, but unfortunately not to be. I trust your experience here will be perfect if it's ONLY Eric and you )with no other patrons to share him with), otherwise this long time native L.A. sushi addict highly recommends you journey to the fabulous Sen Sushi for the complete package of joy and sushi happiness."
"2","Thanks for Tien for setting up this awesome UYE! Minus the fact late for his own UYE. Lol! Also BIG time shout out too Kevin for following his lead with sushi tasting menu or who knows like having whatever he stay having!  Reason why Kevin duke and just another yelper that secret spot is out. Mahalo for letting rest of us yelpers in.\n\nIt been long time since went for sushi a la carte. AYCE is just the way too go get little bit of everything and keep going until one tummy is happy in life. Yummy talk about Sushi change up in life!!! Sometimes in life or food not about quantity but quality. OMG! Everything the quality was unreal. The sushi chef Eric showing us some of the fish just got in since was tuesday. He had this amazing looking needlefish or sayari. I never had before but said that few times. They have boards with different fish gets in every week everyone talks about the uni. Unfortunately they did not have it. =( The sayari sashimi style knowing literally cut fresh off the bone. It served with quail egg mixed together was perfect balance. It same came too sweet shrimp. Deep fry the head good stuff dipped in the sauce. Sayari bones too! Every sushi was amazing flavors, depth, and stuff like scallops never had in sushi restaurant. Scallops that blew my mind! Fresh Oysters combine with the sauce like slurp of sea heaven. Every sushi was more and more amazing. We ended it with american kobe beef roll that by far best speciality rolls EVER! Me more about the nigiri style sushi. It true sushi for me all about the quality of the fish and rice. Sushi in its truest form. Desserts we had the deep fried plum and black sesame seed ice cream. The plum had much more flavor then I could ever imagine. The crispy goodness outside mixed with the plum ice cream very nice. The black sesame seed honestly not fan of. I think that sesame seed in ice cream not meant too be just weird flavor. \n\nThe whole time thinking of Jiro \""dreams of sushi\"".  I did have one roll. The whole presentation of just one nigiri, few course of sashimi style fish, and the presentations was truly artwork. Too the little details on the oysters it christmas assortment of toppings, sweet shrimp looked like gold flakes on top, sayari tight presentation with the head standing straight up and the quail egg placed perfect on top of the sashimi fish, and go on and on. Tell the passion sushi chef Eric has in every piece of fish. It really refreshing style too see non AYCE cares about the finer details. Once again thanks too Kevin the sushi chef Eric hooked us up with bottle of sake. Yay.\n\nThe service is awesome! Never empty glass and just on it. Without doubt I will be coming back here again!"
"2","The best sushi spot in Vegas! They have the FRESHEST fish you can get despite being in the middle of a desert, haha. The staff is very friendly and attentive and watching the precision the chefs take when making rolls and dishes is amazing. Definitely my new favorite sushi spot."
"1","nah. my friends did not like the poke/seafood salad...and i tasted it, it was not GOOD."
"2","The owners were really nice. Jeff meticulously took his time applying my gel polish. I am a stickler for edge to edge coverage, sealed tips, zero run off on the cuticle. Jeff did a fabulous job. While my nails grew, the gel didnt budge for 3 weeks. This is a definite go-to if you like getting a quality job. Call and make an appointment before you head over."
"2","Always make a 7 AM appointment (for fasting tests) and usually get called in within 5 minutes of appointment time. Consistently good. We always go to the location at Lake Mead and Buffalo. Staff is pleasant and competent.\nOf course, today I called to get the results and was told that one test was still \""pending\"". The lab didn't receive the specimen until after midnight today despite the fact that the blood draw was taken at 7 AM yesterday. That's the last time I make an appointment for a Friday :-).\nOtherwise, I recommend this location highly."
"1","I've been in this place a handful of times, and I guess I never reviewed them.  I was going to go in again tonight for late night happy hour so I could refresh myself, so I called in to make sure that still exists.  The girl that answered the phone told me there is no happy hour, late night or regular, and there never was.  REALLY?  I swore I went there with friends and ate $1 sliders.  Maybe the food is just always cheap?  I dunno, not sure if I want to go back to a bar that doesn't do a happy hour."
"2","Hubby wanted some kind of brunch today with a view.  After about 10 minutes of burning some brain cells, I finally remembered this restaurant by a pond or lake off of Buffalo.\nIf you are in need of a nice sit down, take your time brunch with a view, this is the place to be.\nI ordered 3 poached eggs in this wine reduction sauce of mushrooms, ham bits and shallots.  My taste buds were in heaven!  Hubby ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes which were just as tasty.\nAnd of course we had apple crumb with vanilla ice cream for dessert.\nThis bistro has many different types of wine, (I had an Italian Pinot Grigio with my meal).\nIt was over 100 degrees but very comfortable in the outside seating under the shade with mist spraying.  Beautiful big lake with swans, carp and these cute little turtles.\nThe food, ambiance, and waiter all made it a 5 star restaurant!"
"1","We've been there three times, trying to square its stellar reputation with our experience;  last night was for supper.  \n\nSERVICE: It took an hour for the food to arrive;  we'd ordered easy appetizers, a burger and a baked chicken dish.  Trop Tarde!\n\nSTAFF: We've found them to be engaging, but distracted.  The restaurant doesn't deign to put out salt and pepper shakers; I asked two waiters in succession to get those for me.  Nothing happened after about 10 minutes, so I got up and went for them myself;  lots of confusion and hand-waving to get them, only to find they were not functional.  Merde!\n\nAMBIENCE:  Nice;  the lake, the swans, plausible pseudo-French accents, a neat guy handling the music.  C'est bon!\n\nFOOD:  The broiled shrimp, cheese grits & remoulade appetizer was execrable.  I'm from New Orleans;  we board up and condemn restaurants that massacre simple dishes like that.  My wife liked the burger, but it didn't like her;  it entertained her for 24 hours ;-(  My broiled chicken was meh exemplified.  Any Albertson's rotisserie can beat it;  \u00e9crasez l'inf\u00e2me!\n\nPRICE PERFORMANCE:  All this mediocrity for a tipped bill of ~$83?\nScandale!\n\nOVERALL:  Alright, kindergarten's over.  No more March\u00e9 for me.\nC'est Fini!"
"1","Not kid friendly! We arrived around 5 pm, knowing that we did not have a RSVP and expecting a little wait. Upon arriving with our 12 year old daughter the Host stated it would be a little wait. There were 3 more groups of adults that were sat without a RSVP prior to the Host telling us they could not serve us and we had to leave. I have eaten there plenty of times, the food is poor and over priced by sitting by the water is what we go for. That being said go to Garfields next door. Way nicer employees, better food and kid friendly!"
"2","This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again."
"1","Awful costumer service!!! I felt like I was being rushed even though there weren't any people behind me. I'm assuming the woman who \""assisted\"" me was a manger because she was the only one I saw in a red shirt. But she needs a course on costumer service. She was very short and acted as if I was wasting her time. I don't care how badly we want bagels we will never return to this location."
"1","These guys are thieves!  \nI accompanied my wife to the store one day to have a headlight bulb installed.  I tried but was afraid I'd break something, so we let them do it.  The $25 installation charge wasn't the problem; the problem occurred when the service technician approached my wife and told her she needed a new set of tires and her AT fluid flushed, along with an oil change.\nOur oil is full synthetic and was just changed 2 months prior and only accumulated 3,000 miles since then.  The AT has absolutely no issues and shouldn't be flushed so soon; absolutely no reason.  The tires had tons of available tread on them, so we went around the corner to discount tires, where they told us we didn't need tires for at least another 20,000 miles!  Go figure.  Pep Boys Technicians have little honesty."
"1","Just wanted a trim, got a quick perfunctory cut.  Grumpy hairdresser."
"1","So after gambling $120 at the bar with full bets I was told that I didn't gamble enough to have my three beers and shot of whisky comped. Then the bartender comped the guys drinks next me who only gambled $20 and ordered $50 in drinks. This place sucks, especially the staff. Never going there again."
"1","This shop overcharges for parts, and they will sell service that is not necessary. Shop manager Mike will lie to your face and call you \""bro.\"" This is no longer a reputable shop, and they do sloppy work.\n\nI had a front brake job done in the Summer. Within 6 months/4,000 miles, I have brake chatter, and the rear brakes are leaking/locking up, despite checking out fine during the previous inspection. This first brake job was quoted at over $400. After some debate with \""Scotty,\"" I was able to get the price reduced, but evidently at the cost of mechanical sabotage. Current repair estimate for the rear is (surprise) over $400.\n\nI paid $40 for an oil change using my own oil. During the change, oil was spilled all over the place, making the motor smoke and stink. \n\nThe shop was more than happy to charge me for a brake bleed that I did not need.\n\nThe manager \""Mike\"" does not care about customer service in the least, and when I told him he had lost a customer, he hung up on me. Very unsatisfactory."
"1","Seriously the worse food for Mexican food. Food was either too salty or too bland. Order the \""Wet Bean/Cheese Burrito\"" and 12 rolled tacos. Burrito was horrible assembled and the red sauce was way too salty. The tolled tacos we bland and the guacamole was watered down. I know I don't come here for the service cause it sucks. Lady who took my order was rude, horribly representing service. Food was priced OK but they charge extra to use your credit card and if you want refills on your drinks. \nFor this type of food place, I would totally recommend to go to Don Tortaco or Tacos el Gordo. Way better price, service, and quality."
"1","Small skinny sandwiches with high price-tried it once never again.  And openning up across from subway wasn't to smart."
"1","If you want good Mexican food do not go here. It's the Mexican version of mcdonalds and I will never have it again."
"1","Needed to replace a dead battery previously purchased at this Auto Zone. Technician was not helpful in any way and resistant to anything my husband had to say regarding the battery not holding a charge. I understand that AZ has a policy about testing the battery prior to replacement and that's fine. The problem was this guy insisted that they HAD charge the battery before they could replace it. My husband had already had it on the charger and it wouldn't hold a charge. We told him this, but that's not good enough, apparently. Charging the battery takes one hour and we didn't have that much time. He should have swapped out the battery based on his test and the fact that we already charged it. \n\nLong story short, we left and went to another AZ where the battery was promptly replaced. Customer service is lacking at the Jones AZ."
"1","I found the food here to be positively awful.  I went because I saw a Food Channel show on BBQ culture in the South, and it gave me a craving that this place cured, but did not satisfy. Yuck."
"2","I have been coming her for a LONG time. They have the best lumpia shanghai! Chicken adobes amazing! A lot of other places have it but this one has a one of a kind taste. Marisa, the owner is a sweetheart. She is always so friendly. I like her turon. Every time I come here It seriously brings back memories of the Philippines. Oh how would love to go back."
"1","Fiesta, with a name like that, you'd think this place would be more of a blast. It should be renamed Siesta. \n\nThis place is gross. No other way to put it. A casino that looks well past it's age. The Fiesta is home to a stagnant, stale scent of cigarettes, a buffet (which may be the grossest place you'll ever eat in your life), a Denny's, Club Tequila, a Mexican restaurant, and an ice skating rink.\n\nPart of Station Casinos, this place must be the blacksheep of their properties. I don't recommend staying here, playing here, or eating here. There are decent acts playing at Club Tequila and who doesn't like making a fool of themselves on the ice."
"1","This is my first 1-star review, after roughly 30 reviews.\nAlthough reviews are subjective in nature, I think that Yelp reviews have an air of objectivity, which is why their reputation is what it is. I follow that credo. \nSince I've lived in Las Vegas, for one reason or another (mainly to play penny slots), I've been to practically every major casino in town, at all times of day: 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, and most recently 2 AM.  \nThis is my review of the atmosphere of the Fiesta Rancho casino. I've never stayed in one of their rooms (because I'm a local), I can't remember eating at any of their restaurants, I've never skated on their rink, and I've never gone into any of their nightclubs.\nI'm still scratching my head, regarding reviews written by other locals who live in the NW, yet have stayed in Fiesta rooms (and have checked-in multiple times). Can anyone clear that up for me?\nIn any event, I've not gambled at the Fiesta Rancho more than I have at any other casino.\nHowever, I've personally heard or have been in close proximity to 3 disturbing incidents at this casino, whereas I've not seen 1 at all the other casinos combined.\nWhile playing there, I've heard gun shots coming from the other side of the casino. Many years ago, my car was vandalized in their parking lot. At the time, I didn't pay it a second thought. Last night, a woman's purse was stolen, and the robbers escaped without a security guard in sight. In fact, the woman screamed for a security guard, and one didn't come over for 2 or 3 minutes.\nMaybe this is just a coincidence, but I really don't believe in coincidences.\nLike I said...Even though my own property was vandalized years ago, I continued to play there through last night, so this review is not biased from that event.\nBut, after last night, I'll never play there again. I don't want to worry about potential wrong-doings.\nI'll gamble with money, but I don't wish to gamble with anything more precious.\nSorry."
"1","I give it 2 stars because I love Dr. Roach: he is an amazing vet and individual. However, I will never return because they gouge you big time. Unless you are made of money and live nearby, I can't see any reason for coming here.\n\nFor instance, I just got my cat's teeth cleaned for $149 after a Living Social discount. The place I took her to normally charges $300. Craig Road quoted me a price of $550 for the exact same procedure.\n\nI have blown so much money at this place for being too lazy to seek out alternatives. Don't be a sucker like me.\n\nOne more thing, I was expecting to also pay for a tooth extraction because one of the doctors at Craig Road told me a fang needed to be removed. I was pleasantly surprised when the new place told me the fang was fine.\n\nI forgot to mention several things previously, and I will rectify the situation now. CRAH is dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to bleed you as much as they can; they care about nothing but money.\n\nOn my last visit to this place, my cat was undergoing a procedure that put her under anesthesia, so I thought this would be an opportune time to get her shaved. Stupid me, one of those brilliant technicians they employ cut her during the process. I could have done that myself, which was why I thought i was doing the right thing by having them do it in the first place. You would think that with those usurious prices they charge they could afford to hire more competent staff. \n\nAnother thing that always bothered me about this place is the way they always take your animal in back to do anything, so you never actually know if they are actually doing what they are charging you for. After visiting other vets my eyes have been opened. I was shocked when another vet actually brought in x-rays and showed them to me. Craig Road never does this, the doctor just comes back in and will say something like everything looked fine and they just want you to take their word for it, while they lighten your wallet by another 140 dollars.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask to see any x-rays, and always ask what a procedure will cost before they perform it, so you don't suffer from sticker shock. Ask what medications will cost before they prescribe them and read up a little beforehand to see if the medication is needed for it could be just another one of their up sells to fatten their bottom line, or better yet, do not go there at all.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned the high staff turnover. I imagine this could very well be due to a doctor not meeting their upsell quota, since they all recommend as many superfluous procedures as possible. Mike F., the man who responded to my post so sanctimoniously and so shamelessly probably tosses them out on their ear if they are not screwing every customer over to his satisfaction. Mike F. is completely full of shit and like this clip joint he runs, he stinks to high heaven. I wish I could remove those stars.\n\nAnother reviewer asked \""are all vets crooks?\"" in her review and I can answer with a definitive no.  Do not compare other operations to this place. True, lots of vets will play on your emotions, your love for your animal to separate you from your money but nothing in my experience compares to Craig Road. The culture that is instilled there is almost sociopathic in its callus greed. If my review seems bitter it is because I am angry at myself for having patronized this place too many times. I am to blame more than they are.\n\nIt is sort of like the old parable about the good woman who found a frozen rattlesnake by the side of the road and took it home and nursed it back to health. When the snake recovered it bit her and as she lay dying she asked the snake why it repaid her in such fashion after all she had done for it, and the snake said in reply, \""look bitch, you knew I was a snake.\"" \n\nI feel like that gullible woman, or like the idiot who went back to the 3-card Monty game after having already been burned. So again, heed my advice, I implore you, stay away from the snake."
"1","After seeing this place on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, I decided to give it a try.  Guy F. was raving about the place.   Ask any BBQ pro about boiling ribs and they will look at you like you just stole their elderly mother's life savings.  John Mull's boils their ribs before finishing on the grill but Guy stated \""this is competition meat\"".\n\nSo I make the trip there, really strange looking neighborhood and place.  Tiny on the inside, luckily it was not crowded.  I ordered a 2 meat combo.  Ribs and links, I told the young man preparing my plate that I wanted my sauce on the side, he said they don't put sauce on the meat, sauce is over on the counter.  Good sign.   I looked around as he was preparing my plate then went over to put some sauce in the little containers.   All set, got my food and headed out the door.  Not really any place to eat there except for some picnic benches outside but it was far too hot to be outside so I decided to head to the nearest covered lot and eat in my car.    Finally got to a hotel parking structure and was ready to feast!\n\nOpened my tray and found that this idiot kid covered my ribs with the links that were swimming in sauce!!!!  I literally wanted to scream!  I told the idiot I didn't want sauce on my ribs yet he proceeded to put the cut links and sauce on top of my ribs.\n\nAnyway, started on the ribs and they were not very good at all, tender but no flavor at  and the sauce sucked!   The links tasted like hot dogs.   Overall not good Q.\n\nThanks Guy!!!   I was at another restaurant and the owner claimed that Triple D requests a fee for them to visit your restaurant.   I believe that.  Have you ever seen Guy say \""that place was just OK'??"
"2","Best non-Southern BBQ I've had, thinking of it makes my molars sweat."
"2","Awesome!!!\nI will start with the big negative part of my review: \nLONG ASS WAIT TIME ! only reason 4 and not 5 stars-\nthat is all for the negative.\nPositives:\nMac N Cheese is the best in our solar system. If that is all you get from there you will be pleased.\nThey offer briskett, pork, chicken-pulled/quarters, links. \nThere cold sides are sort of commercial- nothing special though. The cobbler is BOMB as well.\nYou can call in your order but it still takes a bit to get it. \nThe employees are the same for the past 2 years I have been going there which tells me he treats his folks RIGHT!"
"2","Ok, so it may not have the posh as some of the restaurants on the strip may have, but Bob Taylors ranch house does offer a great steak meal with a budget in mind.  I was just there a couple of days ago, and I must say the \""Diamond Jim Brady\"" strip was excellent!  Now I won't go as far to say that Bob Taylor's has the best steak, in my opinion you have to go to Chicago for that, but I will say say this place has very good food while keeping the pocket book in mind.  By they way, the appitizer chicken livers are exceptional.  Anyway, the service is very good and the food is excellent when considering the price.  I must say to all new Vegas residents, that Bob Taylor's is a must visit!"
"2","This has to be my Favorite restaurant in vegas. Probably the best meal I've ever had in Vegas. Our first time coming here. I thought there was something wrong with my gps when I came here. Its in the middle of no where. Theres a lit walkway to the entrance. When you walk in it feels like your in a time warp in the 1960's, I love places like this that don't change there d\u00e9cor it gives the place charisma and have a lot of history to it.. The Rib-Eye steak was probably the best Rib-Eye I've had and the service was outstanding."
"1","The food was good. Prime rib was the best there. But, as the other reviewers mentioned this place lacks management. The lady behind the bar, Katelynn was VERY unprofessional. She had what appeared to be multiple groups of friends come and go as we ate. She gave them all unlimited drinks and seemed to be joining in the drinking with them. She flirted with men and I also heard her talking of going out after work with them. The cook was in view the entire time and seemed to be great at his job. Get rid of the corruption there and it would be perfect! Prices are decent too."
"2","Absolutely one of the best steaks in town.  Not a big fan of the sides that came with it but I ordered the 22oz. porterhouse and it was amazing.  Service was excellent!!  Waitress was very friendly and the food was delivered quick!  Maybe a little too quick lol.  I didn't get to finish my salad.  It's ok because it was mediocre like the rest of the sides.  The steak is why you're here though and well worth it!!"
"2","Love it, love it, love it!\n\nBy far, the best brewery in Vegas. Their Holy Cow Pale Ale usually has me saying \""Holy Cow\"" by the time I leave! They have a standard 4-5 of their brews, plus seasonal fare on tap at all times. Try the sampler to get a taste of all of them.\n\nThe food menu is diversified. Everything from cheese curds to meatloaf and everything in between. Have never had a bad meal here over the years. \n\nFood is excellent, service is excellent whether you're sitting up at the bar, in the bar area or seated in the restaurant. \n\nI'm dying to give this place 5 stars, but until they bring the phenomenal taco pizza and taco quesadilla  back, I have to hold out on the 5th star.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you're a local, drop by. If you're from out of town, make the trip over here. You won't be disappointed!!"
"1","90 minutes for 3 people to get breakfast... It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and an hour for our food. The beers we tried were good and the food was solid but based on the service I definitely won't be back to this location. It was not super busy and there was plenty of staff and we couldn't see what the extreme delay was all about."
"2","Well, this place is extremely chill on a Saturday evening, and though we didn't get to try the food, well the beers are real good! IPA, lake mead monster, even Pilsner, so good!"
"1","We arrived at 8:20 for the all you can eat shrimp. When we approached the hostess, she informed us that she would seat us, but they are closing the dining room and we'd be the last customers. I'm unsure why this was relevant, it only made me feel like an inconvenience and that she was doing us a favor. My son got the shrimp those were good. These rest of our meals were awful. I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check. After we received our food we did not see anyone until that point, once the 3 of us had to stare down the staff to get attention."
"2","Great lunch,  microbrews and service. Sheila was great! The first time I went in it was just for drinks on a Tuesday night and the service was dreadful. Today more than made up for it. I will certainly be back."
"1","I called this particular Pep Boys and asked how much it would cost for an oil change.. They said $32.95. So I went and dropped my car off, returned to pick it back up, only to get charged an additional $20 for LABOR! Ridiculous. They should've disclosed ALL costs that I was going to be charged over the phone. I would go somewhere else if you're looking for an oil change. That was an extremely shady tactic, not disclosing everything I would've been charged."
"1","This place sucks. The customer service is horrible. They dont serve food unless you order a pizza from a neighboring restaurant. Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was \""busy\"" celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER."
"1","I used to come here for years, maybe about a year back.. the best weekend drinkfests back then: Fridays were ladies night (dollar well, wines and domestics, $2 you call its, and no cover). Saturdays were free beer night (draft bud light, coors light and pbr til they gave out 1,000 of each.. again, no cover). Was always packed and played a decent variety of music; pitchers for beer pong were also always dirt cheap. And despite,  the bartenders were way personable and fun.\nI'm not trying to sound like a cheapskate, as I am in the service industry myself.. but there must've been a change of ownership since my prior experiences. This is all feels like a place that you would come to die. All old fogies glued to their video poker, nothing bud old, terrible country music via jukebox, versus the dj that once kept the party rockin. \n I tried a little experiment tonightis with said jukebox, and put on some of my flavor music.. within seconds all the older crowded started fussing, and after a couple songs literally took my music off... really. \nAlso, it seems absolutely painful for swift service. And once i finally got my cocktail, both times, the garnish was not replenished. The barmaid would much rather go on with certain guests about her hooligan daughter who is apparently gonna end up pregnant or in jail sometime soon, rather than make sure the drinks are kept full... I tend bar myself,  and the way i see it is i don't need to be encouraged to make money. Guess with the older crowd, tips must be a bit shorter than back then too, but I also don't see any familiar faces. Guess they cleaned house, bonehead move.\nLong story short, i miss the old Hideaway."
"2","Long drive from Las Vegas but a breathtaking view once you get there...it's worth the trip. :)"
"2","Been coming here for a few years now & wouldn't trade it for the world!! Awesome service but most importantly AWESOME ICE-CREAM"
"1","it has one star, because its required before i can tell you how HORRIBLE this location is.\nOH MY GOD!\nits like they went to fremont and hired any possible preson who was desperate for a job. a couple of the associates smelled, thats right SMELLED. like body odor. seriously? take a shower, youre in customer service let alone the FOOD BUSINESS! the kid at the register seemed as if he just got back from smoking a blunt in the back and although my order was repeated back correctly, it was received INCORRECTLY!\nwhen i went back to get them to do it right, it took 5 minutes before i had to yell to the back to get someones attention. then the person that ended up fixing what was wrong fixed it with no gloves. god knows what she was doing before considering all staff disappeared to the back. the people behind us waiting for food even said they had terrible customer service. at one point i got so tired of waiting i climbed over the counter for ketchup. on top of all that, when my boyfriend got his food, it looked like the person who made the sandwich got hungry and gouged a piece of chicken right out of the center THEN proceeded to put it on the bun. food looked old, overcooked, dry, disgusting! \ni ended up handing everything back and demanding a refund.\nabsolutely ridiculous staff!\nstart hiring people with educations and people that show respect to those around them by BATHING. this place needs to be start over from scratch. from building to employees.\nworst KFC, ever!"
"1","Do not eat here if you like Chinese food.  Flies in the restaurant.  The food was okay, but the service wasn't great at all.  Although the portions are large, they aren't worth eating. AT ALL. \n\nNo no no no no no no."
"2","This is a really great place to buy all your liquior needs! Its cheap and most definitely a spot if your friends are out in vegas and need to pre game before heading out of the hotel. Theres a bunch located in vegas!"
"1","Service was very friendly. But this location needs a deep cleaning. It is very dirty with dirty bathrooms. Cleanliness is not a priority for this location"
"2","I like this place! It's quiet, the place is big and laid out well.. the slot selection is awesome to boot, and hell I visited the little Grand Cafe to grab lunch and the waitress was nice enough to offer me the $9.99 special for a steak with mashed potatoes and greens.. gotta say was the best steak I ever had at $10 seriously topping other places that charge double.. On top of it being a nice place I won $75 easily paying for my lunch and dinner later on that night! Station's are great casinos they don't try to be anyone else but themselves and treat you right."
"2","Good sandwiches.  Can't really explain it, but it's not the same as any other sandwich joint (like Subway or Blimplies).  My recommendation is that someone make a good business move and open one of these places out here.  MMMM...."
"2","My cat Tootsie got very sick a couple of weeks ago (completely out of the blue) and we were in a bit of a panic as it was later in the day but we called ahead and rushed her here as we had heard great things. Sadly, after running a couple of tests, we found that there wasn't anything that really could be done to help her and we had to make the hardest decision a pet parent can make, but they were so incredibly helpful in our moment of sadness and Creature Comforts is certainly an appropriate name. We will be bringing our other two furbabies there in the future."
"1","We took the short tour and I'ma tell you the truth, while our tour guide was entertaining, the most interesting part was the 10 minute movie before the tour. I think you get access to parts of the dam that you wouldn't normally if you're just visiting the dam without a tour, but I'm still not sure that it's worth it."
"2","I have taken this tour two different times. Some parts of it seem a little dated, mostly the dialogue in the beginning video, but the facts are still very interesting and the tour is amazing because of the structures. I would recommend this tour to anyone that is not claustrophobic because at one point in the tour, you take an elevator to the lower levels and it can be a bit much for people with those sensitivities."
"1","The best feeling is coming out of a nail spa and admiring your freshly done nails...this was not the case. Costumer service was non existing, felt I unwelcome and service was rushed. I will not be returning."
"1","I'm only giving this one star because I can't give it less on the review site.  This is the WORST salon service I've ever gotten. I purchased a Groupon for a mani/pedi combo.  I went with a group of friends while we were on vacation in Vegas.  We weren't greeted at the door and no one offered us anything to drink at all. Weird for a salon. The woman doing the nails arrived late to the appointment for one of us, and then didn't know how to remove her gel nail polish. After she couldn't do it, she made my friend remove it herself. And at the end she tried to charge her an extra 10 dollars for it. While she was doing another of my friends nails she kept popping chocolate into her mouth. How unsanitary is that? Gross. She finally told us we could help ourselves to their awesome espresso machine but it was two dollars, and if we wanted soda, it'd also cost us. First time someone at a salon has ever tried to charge me for a drink. Well, after she was done stuffing her face with bon bons she got around to actually doing my friends nails. She told us we couldn't do boring colors because it wasn't \""VEGAS\"" enough. Um, last time I checked, WE were paying YOU for the SERVICE. Not your decision. My friend had a hangnail and the bon-bon tech lady decided to put superglue on it, but she didn't want to stick a pin in the top of the superglue spout to clear it out because she \""didn't want to hurt herself\"" so she made one of us do it. Classy. Then she stuck superglue all over my friends cuticle, which she spent the rest of the night removing. During the pedicure portion for my friend, she actually made her legs bleed with the scrubbing she did. Yikes. And when my friend told her she'd bought a dress for a grey dress for a night out, the bon-bon lady told her that grey is an ugly color. Professional all the way. When one of my friends complimented my purse the bon-bon lady said \""That's a grandma purse\"". Excuse me? Who asked you? My appointment with her started half an hour late. She cut my cuticles so bad that one of my fingers bled the rest of the night. I didn't even get the full pedicure because we didn't have time because we had tickets to see a show that night, which we weren't able to make on time anyway. \n\nSome other fun things from our posare salon visit: Bon-bon lady kept answering her phone during our nail services.  Complained that her son, though really, really good-looking, kept bringing home \""one fat girl after another\"". Bon-bon lady wasn't exactly supermodel weight herself... The equipment wasnt nice either. The pedicure chairs were old and dirty and the manicure tables looked like they needed a good wipe down with a disinfectant.\n\nTo sum it up, this was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a salon. SuperCuts is classier than this place was. This place needs Tabatha Coffey to visit it, because that's the only way I'd EVER visit it again."
"2","Great executive course.  You can use your driver on about 7 holes, the other 11 will be starting with an iron.  So, it is a standard par 60 executive course.  The fairway, green, and the tee were all perfect green grass even in the middle of winter.  The carts worked great.  We went on a friday morning and there were very few other golfers.  So we took our time and really enjoyed ourselves.  \n\nThe view of Las Vegas on the back nine of this course is breath taking."
"1","I have had a few \""okay\"" experiences with this florist in the past.  On Valentines Day 2013 my husband purchased their largest red rose arrangement for $300.  The presentation was nice, if a little dated, but sadly within just a couple days the flowers died.  Every other time I have received flowers from this company they have not lasted as long as other florists or even the cheap flowers from the supermarket.  I would rate the quality of the arrangements from this florist as 3/5.\n\nMost recently, my husband attempted to place a last minute balloon order at 3:30 pm from this company over the phone.  Their website states they are open until 5pm so he thought that may be enough time to pick up the balloons.  He was advised by the person who took his order that the balloons would be ready for pick up the same day.  When he arrived to the shop at 3:50 pm the shop was closed early and the store door hours stated they closed at 4pm.\n\nHow did this miscommunication happen?  Well, anyone who is thinking about ordering from this florist should be aware that the phone number they advertise actually goes to an off site call center that represents themselves as in-house.  My husband was lied to that he could get the balloons the same day when the florist closed early that day without informing their call center ordering team.  When my husband called the phone number (that they list on their website and on the door of their shop) as he stood outside the CLOSED shop, the person on the phone still tried to represent themselves as a florist on site and that the store was indeed open.  This was very frustrating and the miscommunication and outright lying wasted his time\n\nI understand that sometimes last minute orders cannot be filled but this business needs to update their website with their ACTUAL hours and make sure that whatever ordering service they use is updated with any exceptions to their hours. The call center ordering team that their phone number directs to also needs to be honest about the fact they are not on site."
"1","Dr. Adams is a wonderful doctor.  She is extremely caring, attentive and knowledgeable.  If this review were just for her adequacy as a physician, I would have given her 5 stars. Carly, Dr. Adams' admin, is also a joy to speak with.  She goes above and beyond her call of duty and will to try to help you in every way possible.  \n\nThe two main points that deserve a negative (yes, extremely subpar) rating are:\n\n1. The wait time.  I'm not sure how her staff books her patients; however, I have never had to wait any less than an hour for any of my SCHEDULED appointments.  I once had an appointment at 9:30 and did not get called back for my vitals until 11:40...absolutely ridiculous.\n\n2. Her nurse, Yolanda.  Let me preface this by saying that I am an RN.  I fully understand just how hectic and chaotic a busy physician's office can get at times.  Yolanda has an extremely poor attitude...I'm honestly shocked as to why she ever considered employment in the medical field.  Yolanda is rude, uncaring/unsympathetic and lazy.  I am on various medications, so I have to come into contact with this \""nurse\"" a great deal and every single time, she is extremely rude and uncaring.  It is to the point where as much as I love Dr. Adams, I am considering switching primary care physicians due to Yolanda.\n\nAs I stated earlier, if this review were just for Dr. Adams herself, I would give her a 5-star rating; however the wait time and her nurse Yolanda really bring her practice down."
"1","Mediocre at best.  My fiance and I ordered our old favorite, chicken fajitas.  The peppers were colorful, but not cooked all the way.  The rice and beans were adequate.\n\nThe chips and salsa were not homemade.. AT ALL.  The chips looked like they came from a bag and the salsa was definitely from a jar.  No flavor and nothing special.  \n\nAll in all I have yet to experience good Mexican food out here in Vegas and have had better luck back in NY where I came from."
"2","I've been coming to El Burrito since I was in Middle School and it's still one of my favorite homegrown Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nI've never really had a bad experience or bad food at this place because I pretty much stick to three things on the menu because each of those items are so good that I just never decided to branch out and try anything else.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal. I usually follow that up with the Noodle Soup. It's pretty salty, but it'll warm you up on a cool night and it tastes great.\n\nI usually get one of three entree plates every time I go, which comes with the aforementioned soup.\n\n1) Two Chicken Burritos w/ Red Sauce\n2) Two Tamales\n3) Carne Asada\n\nEach of the items comes with the typical fixings, rice and beans and whatnot. Each of the items are equally tasty, and if you get the two burrito plate you will DEFINITELY have leftovers!\n\nI usually cap the meal off with the sopapillas, which are cinnamon-sugar covered pieces of dough that are absolutely delicious. \n\n:) I highly recommend this place, as a loyal customer for most of my life."
"2","It's been nearly forever since I've been in a Hallmark.  Very nice store and helpful staff but I was surprised to see a small section of the store for greeting cards and a whole lot of other stuff.  Fortunately, I was looking for \""other stuff\""   Found some beautiful packages of not cards although not the traditionally embossed kind I wanted but still cool.  \n\nI was kind of in a rush so didn't look around but really want a new fountain pen!  (yup, I still use them when I actually write!)"
"1","Convenient Gym , lots of equipment and some good classes . A lot of turnover in trainers , rarely see anyone for more than a few months . Equipment is a little worn and they don't clean as much as they should , members leave towels , newspapers around ( not me!) and they stay around a while. Friendly reception desk , kids club is good . They used to sell clothing , no more . Overall the place is tired , there is a brand new club opening on W. Charleston soon , when I join I think I will not be alone."
"2","I LOVE this place. Everyone is really friendly and very comforting. Has wisdom teeth taken out and experienced NO pain or discomfort. I was not put under and did not need to, everything went smooth and painless. Every time I have gone there, it has been enjoyable and the best dentist experience. Dr. Devore is a really great dentist and even better person."
"1","I used to frequent Sultan's Grill a lot in high school. I drove by it last night with a friend and we decided we'd try it out again. I'm not sure if the management has switched over or what but the food was absolutely terrible compared to what it used to be. \n\nWe ordered a gyro sandwich, side of hummus and a falafel plate for dinner. This all totaled up to about $27 and it was definitely not worth it. The falafel was quite possibly the worst falafel I've had. They were tiny, overcooked and severely lacking in flavor. The hummus was bland and boring. It tasted like they threw some garbanzo beans in a food processor and considered that hummus, no spices or anything. The rice was mediocre, the tahini sauce was extremely salty and the fries were ok. The pita bread was hard and dry. \n\nAs someone who's Middle Eastern I know what quality Middle Eastern food should taste like and this is definitely not it. I will not be returning. I'd rather pay the same prices somewhere else where I know the food will taste edible."
"1","This is purely a car wash review, as I have never been inside the convenience store.\n\nThe car wash is fine, but the high-pressure sales tactics they implemented at this and the Rampart location have left me and my husband with a very bad taste in our mouths.  We go to Fab Freddy's because they are water-saving car washes.  We just want the least expensive exterior wash, and have been made to feel extremely guilty for not getting the full detail.  When we reply that we want the $7.99 wash, they act like it isn't an option.  And no, I am no interested in their \""discount\"" card, where you have to give them your personal information in order to save a few cents off your gas with a wash.\n\nNo thanks!!  They are going to lose customers if they don't back off."
"2","I went as far as creating a Yelp account  after being informed of all the negative comments being made. I've been coming to this location for years, I've always enjoyed the pre-wash conversations that Rachel and I have. I told her yesterday that she is by far the sweetest young lady that works here. Then, once I bring my car into the garage, I'm always on the look out for Shakyra or Daniel. They both are such wonderful supervisors. I've spoken to the new manager on a few accounts, he seems like a wonderful person to work for as well. There is a new supervisor as well who I have yet to speak with, but over all, this is my absolute favorite location. Even the cashiers in the store make my experience enjoyable. So, Thank You all! I appreciate your services."
"1","Allow me to justify the 1-Star rating I've awarded Fabulous Freddy's:\n\nI haven't brought my car to a full-service wash for several years now; I have a modified vehicle and not only is it sensitive, but it's delicate when not handled correctly.\nEvery person that worked there seemed to crowd around my car and helped with the cleaning...all 35 minutes of it!\n\n-They cleaned it once, some kid brought it around to be picked up then brought it right back under cover for him and his buddies to once again clean for an additional 15 minutes.  \n-When all was said and done he started my car, and what was to follow nearly gave me a heart attack.  He starts my car and lets it idle for 5 minutes, for whatever reason.  My car is not designed to sit and idle...especially without anyone feathering the throttle!  Then I hear the little bastard revving it!  Really.....a car wash is going to allow their employees to rev customer's cars?  This is crazy poor management.\n\nHe drove it around the corner...I smiled politely (all while driving my teeth up into my skull out of anger), gave no tip, got in and drove off."
"1","They're open until 8 PM for summer, so I showed up around 7:20 and it took an hour. I understand showing up right before a place closes to expect that, but it was 40 minutes before closing! One guy started cleaning the floors instead of working on my car and the guy who was at the beginning of the car wash finally came and cleaned my car at 7:56 PM... four minutes before they were suppose to close. Don't really see the point in staying open late when you care more about going home than finishing cleaning my car. The wash was fine but I always feel like I'm waiting on the workers at Freddies, rather than just waiting for my car to be clean in a timely manner. Maybe you need managers on site or something?"
"1","I only come here to get my eyebrows waxed. This is the place i'll go to if I don't want to drive to far to get my eyebrows done. They usually do a great job for $8, but recently they have been doing horrible. I do not recommend you coming here for your eyebrows\n\nI also came here with a friend who wanted to get stiletto nails (pointy nails). They looked horrible, she had to go to her usual spot and get the nails removed and redone."
"1","Yesterday, two co-workers and I got $18 tee times at Desert Rose, which we had deemed a steal. We'd never been, but I knew that it was the oldest course in Las Vegas. It's also in a dire state of emergency; frankly I'm surprised it's still operating. I live on the east side near UNLV, which is no utopian paradise by any means. So when I say that the neighborhood surrounding the course is sketchy, I mean bombed out and on the verge of being condemned. There were more boarded-up houses on the entrance road than I could easily count. Somewhere around the 7th hole a kid in a neighboring house was yelling at us while we were teeing-off in an attempt to distract us. I believe it was the 16th hole where a gentleman in front of us intentionally drove a ball into another neigboring house (we assumed for similar circumstances). And, not sure which hole it was where someone had their home stereo cranked to 11 blasting some sort of favela crunk. \n\nEnough of the fun stuff, let's talk about the course:  There is a dry wash that cuts through Desert Rose, which is literally a trash dumping site. See my photos. This starts at the first hole, and continues through most of the course. There is also a creek with actual water running through it (a flowing trash heap), and dozens of ducks hanging around the first two holes (duck crap covers the greens). The fairways have a 20-foot wide swath of live grass leading up to the greens, everything else is brown, dead, dusty mess. My bag literally emanated a dust cloud when I smacked it at the end of the day. There are two areas where the golf cart goes through concrete flash flood sewer areas covered with grafitti. It looks and feels like the inspiration behind a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. \n\nThere are two holes where the signs have been stolen, most of the bunkers don't have rakes either (assumed they were also stolen). I believe it was the 13th or 14th hole that was literally a construction site (tractors, caution tape, sewer pipes) which required driving the cart \""off road\"" into the drainage ditch. One bonus was that whenever I sliced and lost a ball in the drainage ditch abyss, I usually found 2-3 other lost balls to replace it. We chatted with an older gentleman looking for his ball on the other side of the ditch; he said \""I think it may have landed in this trash heap\"". When was the last time you said that at a golf course?  \n\nOnto the positive part of the review. The clubhouse was fairly comfortable, had some great deals on gear (we bought some balls and tees), and had great food in my opinion. The bartender/server was professional and attentive. I'm a fan of \""vintage Vegas\"" which is why I wanted to try this course (I also want to try National; I hope it's better) but in this case it's fallen into neglect. For another 10-12 bucks you can find tee-times at Boulder City muni or an exec course like Desert Willow."
"1","The service was good but the course not so good.  Wouldnt play here again."
"2","Great course.  Well maintained.  The staff is great from the moment you drive up. When in Las Vegas a must play for the price."
"1","A big disappointment. Greens were aerated a few weeks ago and were in terrible shape. Had we been told about this, would have played elsewhere.  Course play management was non existent which slowed us down. Overall, a forgettable course. Much better places to play when in Las Vegas."
"1","Worst McDonalds EVER!!!!!!!!!! They are unable to get an order correct, Went through the drive through last night got home and no Fries in my bag. Got to the window and the woman running the window was talking about her personal life with a co worker laughing it up with her back t us making us wait instead of giving us our ice coffee. Then she seemed to remember she was working and brought us our coffee. Last time I went there I ordered something with no mayo which my tix said... got home and covered in mayo. called up to complain and the response...What do u want me to do about it??? If I get the craving for Mcdonald's I will drive out of my way.. I hope this one goes out of business....  This location is good for nothing"
"1","This review is for the Emergency Room. (I wonder whether my review will be \""filtered\"" just like the 25+ other 1-star reviews... )\n\nI honestly hope that neither you nor your loved ones would ever need to go to the ER but if you do, avoid this place like the plague.\n\nThis is the WORST medical establishment I've ever been to, staffed and run by incompetent clowns. Everyone with whom I encountered from the check-in staff through the nurses to the PA was grossly unprofessional. \n\nThe wait is also horrible, 4.5+ hours before being seen by a doctor? Seriously?? And \""being seen\"" means his glancing at you for 5 seconds??? In fact, the wait was so long that by the time I was finally seen by the doctor, they had managed to loose my test sample they collected upon my arrival.\n\nOh, and do not expect privacy - it's non-existent there. Also, do not expect to be treated like a human being at Summerlin Hospital. What you can expect is overhearing nurses discussing their meal preferences at Chipotle as well as gossiping and making fun of patients after their departure (but still in front of other patients that are still there.) You can also hear nurses mocking patients that are in pain or loudly counting down the remaining time of their shift or complaining about their job. They also act offended if they are called to the patient's room. What a joke. Even the doctor was complaining that he needs to deal with 17-20 patients at a time. Whose fault is that??? Mine??? Not really but I was certainly paying for that with my time.\n\nTo top it off, I also had to witness one of the nurses complain about how \""nothing works here\"", which surely didn't help me re-establish trust in this facility. When I asked the nurse about the necessity of a certain procedure, she just shrugged her shoulder and answer: \""This is what he [the doctor] orders for everyone.\""\n\nDo not go to the ER at Summerlin Hospital unless you do not mind being robbed off your time, your money and your dignity."
"1","Took my little one to see Dr. Laura today, after waiting for 1 hour in the waiting room and another one in the examination room, I decided to open the door because the room was getting hot a rude nurse told me that I needed to keep the door closed, so I asked her if Dr. Laura was going to take longer? She replied that she had 2 more kids to see before us, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that we had been waiting for a long time or at least said Dr. will be here shortly, nothing... Plain rude lady, so after 2 hours and 23 minutes the dr. finally comes in the room and spent a  total of 9 minutes with us!!! She didn't give us any medicine, just the good ole' Tylenol over the counter, I went to the check out desk to deal with another no-manners-whatsoever employee, but at this point didn't even surprise me. We don't need this, for the money that they charge and the amount of employees they have the customer service should be pristine, and from the doctor, after waiting for her for 2+ hours, she should show at least a little interest on the little patient. Kids are kids and is hard to keep them entertained for that long of a time, especially when they are not feeling great. If I could give this place a minus star rating, I would have done it in a heartbeat. As a parent I can only recommend you to stay clear from this place."
"1","My girlfriend wanted to eat here since we've seen the commercials down in So Cal. Now I have eaten at a Ruby Tuesday before in Cleveland, OH, and I thought this one would be the same as its midwestern counterpart. Wow, this Ruby Tuesday was completely different. From the outside it looked like a Cocos or Sizzler. The Ruby Tuesday in Cleveland looked and felt like an upscale Chilis but with a better menu. They even had Stella Artois (my favorite beer) on tap!\n\nThe service here was okay at best, but the food was disappointing, especially after having an amazing experience at another RT. If you want to eat at a Ruby Tuesday, you might as well go to one in the midwest. Stay away from this one."
"1","This used to be one of my favorite places until the last time I ordered a submarino and I found a piece of kitchen sponge in my sandwich \nI will try again soon because I have always had good experiences with Fazolis"
"1","First impression of the place: walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights. No one at the reception desk to greet you, no where to really sit. Once inside, the massage areas were dark, cool and clean which was a relief and the massage I received was good but its still an odd place. I added a body scrub to my massage service and strangely enough, there was no shower to rinse off afterwards. Body scrubs should be done in a wet room, not a dry massage room. So I left feeling little bits of scrub on me and sticky for the rest of the day."
"2","We are now addicted to rock fish. The first bite leaves your mouth swimming in a silky fish in a light soy sauce.  Ok so we ate 5 hours ago and are jonesing for more. On a more traditional taste\nChow fun noodles with black beans sauce and beef. Or the salt and pepper pork chops. Wonder how they will reheat!!"
"2","The staff is a hit or miss which is awesome for a Chinese restaurant! \n\nMost recently I had a nice female server who returned often and was very sweet. \n\nThe complimentary bitter melon soup is delicious to start.\n\nI'm a big fan of their honey walnut shrimp and their crispy pan fried egg noodles is my favorite in town.\n\nThe seating is very close to each other. \n\nThe pricing is average for non Americanized Chinese food around china town."
"1","Upon reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to bring my parents here for lunch when we arrived in Vegas the first day - my parents are the type that only likes to eat Asian food - actually Chinese food to be exact and so I was obliged to find a good Chinese place in Vegas. It was about 2pm when I got here and they were still busy so I took it as a good sign.\n\nHowever, it didn't quite live up to what I expected.. I didn't have that high of expectations to begin with since I know we are in Vegas and it's not like they are known for Chinese food...but I didn't expect that poor of quality either.\n\nTo begin with - the service was okay - I mean I didn't expect much from an Asian place - and they only had like two waitress/waiter and it was busy - so you can imagine that they would forget to bring you things you asked for until you asked about 7-8 times. \n\nThe food was ehhh - I was kind of disappointed because on their online menu they offered Deer meat but they didn't have that on their menu when we got there - only the ordinary stuff - I really did wanted to try Deer meat with mushroom and sacha sauce but they didn't have any dish that offered deer meat so not sure what that's about.\n\nSo instead we order three dishes: Salt and pepper fried shrimp, clay pot chicken and pork crispy chow mein noodles. \n\nThe salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried. The clay pot chicken - didn't have a lot of chicken and the chicken was chopped up in very little pieces it was difficult to eat - there was more mushrooms than chicken. The only dish I thought was fairly decent was the pork crispy chow mein noodles - but then again it wasn't very crispy - they slathered the sauce all over it so it became soggy instead but at least the flavor was okay.\n\nOverall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
"1","This used to be my go to for all things chinese food but unfortunately this place has really fallen apart.  I went here a few months ago and waited 1 1/2 hours for my food to come out (which it never did).  After 2 hours i got up, told the server who said \""sorry you just came at bad time\"" and I left in absolute disgust.\n\nService: There is none.   All the servers aren't kind at all anymore and I don't feel like a guest.  They treat people like second class citizens instead of welcoming them into their restaurant and ensuring quality experience.\n\nFood: Took forever and wasn't able to try it since it never came out.\n\n*No more discount after 10pm :(\n\nOverall: I won't be coming back.  Chinatown is lined up with chinese restaurants and i found my new go to which will be in my next review so stay tuned!"
"2","Loved the Peking Duck, wonderful flavor and they do an excellent table service. I had to ask for napkins and rice both times I've gone, waitstaff is pretty inattentive. Got the Kung Pao Chicken the second time and it gave me a pretty severe case of upset stomach ... but the duck was so good I'd go back. The tea was tasty.\n\nWhat I would consider traditional Chinese atmosphere, they put me next to the water feature when I was dining alone. Incredible amount of white noise, would probably not be good for parties unless you are making some kind of mobster deal."
"1","So disappoint... We ordered a live lobster but It turned out to be a dead one. Ruining my taste."
"2","Every time my fRiend and I have gone here it has been quite good.  We usually would take lunch at her lunch hour, which is 11.  This is about the time they open up.  This means we were the first to be served whatever they had (read: fresh) and without much of a wait.\n\nThe food here is fairly good, comparable to many of the other thai restaurants in town.  I am addicted to Tom Ka Gai soup and they have an excellent soup here that I almost could have without ordering anything else.\n\nI do not like that they serve soda in cans.  However, the overall price of most items here including drinks is very affordable.  It is a very small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend much more than bringing a few people here.  \n\nHrmm...think I'm going there for lunch...writing this is making me crave..."
"2","This is one of the better places to go for curry!\n\nI like the hole-in-wall family owned feel.  Everything I've had here has been good, but they truly shine when it comes to curry.  There are other Thai places I like more, but if I may emphasize just one more time, there are none that I like more in town for curry.\n\nA few of my friends that lived in Thailand or have Thai parents will only eat here...that says something good i my book."
"2","Love it. Near my house and always end up going here twice a month for dinner on my way back from my shop. Its fast its easy and the flavors are spot on. I normally get the spicy eggplant 6* rating. My wife will get the prik king or the chicken fried rice. The spice eggplant is done on point. There is no soggy about it. Other places over cook the eggplant and it tastes bad. This reminds me of being back home in Hawaii at a little thai shop there. The owner is a little thai lady who is very nice and laid back. I also like their curries. I haven't really tried much else other than the pad thai but really wasn't a fan of the way it was done.  either way good little thai joint to try out."
"1","Don't give this place your business!!! Buying my wedding dress was supposed to be a special & memorable experience. Instead, I was treated like crap, ignored, and even hung up on by the owner!! My dress came in missing accessories, and when I asked when I can expect the missing pieces to be delivered, he gave me a deep sigh, rolled his eyes, and said \""I'll let you know!\""  All in all, the entire experience was a nightmare, and the staff was rude & extremely unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
"1","My experience was terrible!!! \n\nI have to buy a bridesmaid dress for a wedding back east.\nThe style was carried at this store. I went there and 4 girls were standing behind the cash register. No one wanted to help. Then I asked where I could find the dress the girl told me a department # and told me to find it. The dept # ended up wrong and I had to ask someone else for help! She told me it would take 4 months to get it in and I needed to buy now. She didn't even know the wedding date! I was so annoyed bc I didn't end up finding any dress and  had terrible help. Id rather order online and take a chance before I went back there to search for a dept # on each tag!"
"1","Drink this. Turn to the left. Swallow. Get out.\n\nThe visit was extremely rushed. Nobody made any attempt to answer questions about the procedure or what was going on. Or why I was getting tests done in the first place. They just rushed through the entire thing. I felt like nothing but a piece of meat.\n\nThe whole experience made what should have been a routine visit for a simple procedure into an utter nightmare.\n\nThe front desk couldn't explain what was needed for the procedure without asking specific questions. They got downright angry when I asked for the address.\n\""It's on Rainbow\"" is a pretty lousy answer. Rainbow is a long road.\n\nEquipment looked like it hadn't been sanitized since the late 80s. I'm pretty sure an X-ray machine shouldn't be covered with the yellow crust like the bottom of a toilet seat."
"2","Great Mac-and-Cheese for the kid.... Mom and Dad were happy too!"
"2","Everything we ate was fabulous!! One in our party is gluten free and her pizza was fantastic (mushroom and truffle oil). I had the borrata and pesto pizza and another had arugula and pear. Our waiter, Matt, was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine. I'm originally from Austin and am used to a wider selection of beers but other than that, top notch!"
"2","Great friendly vibe. Its a chain but the food and service does not reflect that. Very fresh ingredients, creative choices and amazing service. Great everyday dining due to quality, prices and healthy options."
"2","Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae."
"1","I can not speak of their stylist ability as they decided to close early. I knocked at the door, that they locked 35 mins early. Locked. The Manicurist chose to ignore my knocking, but the customer there said something to her, and looked my direction. I obtained their phone number and called. The woman who answered apologized for locking the door and said she would come let me in. However, as she opened the door for me, she smiled and said, \""We closed for the day. Sorry.\"" o.O Outstanding service."
"2","On Monday, March 25, we called our home warranty and they sent out NIck from Quality. He was courteous, friendly, and very knowledgeable. He answered all our questions because our garage door was inoperable after it was serviced by Anytime Garage Doors. (Do not use this company). He replaced the gear box and informed us that the garage door motor is still good. The only problem was the worn out gear box which he replaced. Service and labor cost us $60.00. This company is punctual, honest, and fair prices....I will continue to use these guys. I wish everyone else does too...Great company....great technicians !!!"
"1","this place has no business sense. just made a $1000 of purchases today and they wouldn't let me leave the store with by cart full of items. instead, they made me make 5 trips to my car citing a cart theft problem. GARBAGE. Go to TJ Maxx Marshalls instead. better deals and they let you take you stuff to your car."
"1","I don't really have a great frame of reference to rate this place. I haven't really been in another Burlington Coat Factory except one in my small home town. \n\nThis place was pretty mobbed, and kind of trashy. Many of the areas had crap everywhere, and it just looked pretty run down. Now...I think that Burlington Coat Factory's may just look like this, but I think this one was particularly bad. \n\nIn the changing room, you get a distinct  \""who gives a shit\"" feeling from the staff. Also check out was painfully slow, even though there were a million registers open. I actually don't remember the last time I waited in line as long as I did there. Well, that a least makes me appreciate every other place that has apparently figured out lines.\n\nThat being said, there are some very good deals here, we're talking some rock bottom prices. I recommend it if you are hunting for a great deal, and willing to put up with a lot of people, digging through stuff, and waiting forever to fork over your money. Worth it? Maybe. Depends on the deal you found."
"1","Pricey for a very limited menu which gives a lot of rice for sushi and rolls.\n\nWent here for AYCE.  The service was pretty good, it was fast.  The server automatically split the bill for my group, so that earned them an extra star.  The sushi was nice and big, but so was the amount of rice underneath it.  \n  \nThe AYCE menu is very limited for $22.95 for lunch.  There was no sea urchin/uni they said it was only available for dinner, but it wasn't even on the menu.  Mochi ice cream for desert was not included either.  Desert was plum ice cream, mochi ice cream, red bean ice cream, and orange slices.  I mean, really?  Not even a 1 piece limit on mochi ice cream?\n\nThe rolls that were ordered had a lot of rice.  not too much filling.  at least the fried oysters and shrimp tempura was pretty good.  The ahipoke was more like cucumber and seaweed salad with a couple pieces of ahipoke.  That dish definitely did not capture the essence of what ahipoke is.  \n\nEven though this  place is a convenient location near my side of town, the best all you can eat sushi is still Sushi Mon on Maryland Parkway in the south part of las vegas.  They have the best variety and stay true to sushi."
"2","Sushi suggested by the server, Natsuya (?), were excellent. We did the AYCE and the service was very nice; Suggestive- but never imposing nor aggressive.  It's a small place with good energy and the sushi chefs had a great attitude.\n\nThe price was very decent too. I have already been a repeat customer and will continue to be. =D"
"2","Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting d\u00e9cor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.\n\nWhen I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. \n\nShogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a \""secret menu\"" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. \n\nUnlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  \n\nIf you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.\n\nThere used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. \n\nKyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.\n\nI love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in \""Goodfellas\"" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is \""Omakase\"" and they take care of everything for me. \n\nI've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world."
"2","I went to this restaurant yesterday looking for a reasonably priced sushi restaurant and I found one! I had the spider rolls and the crunchy rolls, both were great and both were under $10. Service is quick, and don't let the outside intimidate you! It's a hole-in-the-wall and is family owned so if you support small business I recommend you check this place out."
"1","BOOBIES + HOT WINGS = PARADISE!!!!!\n\nTheoretically, the above equation rings true.  Not so much at the Hooter's in Vegas.  From a dining standpoint, it sucked.  The service was very slow (how does it take 45 minutes to fry up wings!?), the coffee was served in styrofoam cups, the \""plates\"" were wet (ewwwww).  The wings were pretty good, but not spectacular.\n\nWell...since the food sucked, BRING ON THE BOOBIES!  Again, disappointment.  Even the main attraction, the so-called \""Hooter's Girls\"" were meh.  Lots of skinny legs, flat asses and fake hootie-hoos. \n\nI dunno. I just didn't get it.  Maybe cause our party consisted of two straight girls and a gay man, but I just wasn't terribly impressed with Hooters."
"1","The one and only reason why we stayed here.....25 dollars a night for a room? Yeah....I'm a Hooters Girl somewhere else and we get a fat discount.\nNever again I'm going on vacation to a place where your room looks like your work....aahhH!!!! I came back more stressed out than I left!\nNightmare.\nThe only good thing, it's next to the strip so that's a plus...and the company I brought with me was the best.\nAnd to whoever said the \""self-respect\"" thing....we actually wear more clothes than a lot of restaurants! If you are from LA....go to Saddle Ranch, you'll see what I mean!\nAnd how could I forget! The girls....OH   MY   GOD. Horrid....Hideous? Whichever you prefer! They looked like 35 year old single moms....ex coke heads... seriously.....no thanks"
"1","Hmmm, how to start this one off. Nasty, dirty, smelly, sleazy, grimy, ugly, depressing,..Not sure. Did I mention dirty? I'll start with that. We could tell from the tiny garage that this place was not frequented for a reason. It is just the epitome of sleaziness. But it's not even up to sleazy Vegas standards. In fact, I'll go ahead and say it, this place should be on the lower end of Fremont st. We got in the elevator and a friend had to hold her nose and breath into her hand so she didn't throw up. And this was on the way to get some of their \""world famous chicken wings\"". Needless to say, we never got those wings (see previous review of restaurant). This place was so depressing and just drained our spirits. We had to escape. There is a reason they are off the strip and nobody goes there. Just stay away. For the price there are so much better things. BTW, In N Out down past UNLV or in the other direction across the 15!"
"1","This place is a Dump and closing its doors forever is imminent."
"2","I only reccommend going here after midnight because the wings are 25 cents each! \n\nYou cannot go wrong with that, but expect to wait at least 30 minutes. Yeah, it sounds like a long time, but if you're drunk enough and you can send someone to put your name on the list, it is definitely worth it."
"1","Saw the 25 cent wings advertisement while walking on the Strip with some friends, so we trekked it over at 2 in the morning. \n\n Bottom line: they taste way better when you reheat them in the morning!!"
"1","Okay I have to give it two stars just because it really isn't much more than a nice Motel 6 or Best Western that is in Las Vegas.  With that said though I was completely shocked with my stay.  My wife and I stayed one night just to catch some sleep before me moved over to one of the other hotels on the strip, and I was fearing the worst.\n\nWe paid $20 for one night, and I closed my eyes while opening the door to my room, half expecting to find a room that would make me wish my wife would let us sleep in the car.\n\nThe room was quite clean, surprisingly decent sized, and the bed was even somewhat comfortable.  I would definitely NEVER stay here for more than one night, but if you need a place for a one night layover or looking for an incredibly cheap place to stay, you may want to check it out."
"1","I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in. \n\nIt's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. \n\nThe drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. \n\nThey sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. \n\nIt wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... \n\nEvery shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.\n\nSadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.\n\nIn the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. \n\nI paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. \n\nIf you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.\n\nFuck this place."
"1","I have stayed here many times, but I will now find somewhere else to stay.\n\nThe front desk people are never very friendly.  \n\nOur first room of this last visit was nasty.  The bathroom tile was coming up and the door hinges were rusty and the paint was coming off the wall near the tub.  The tub had grout coming off.  No continuing maintenance is going on.  \nOur A/C did not work and we had to be transferred at 11:30 pm to another room.  This means that the maid did not report it not working or that they did not fix it.\n\nOur second room was almost as bad.  The bathroom was in the same sorry shape, but the room was nicer.  \n\nThe Casino is always fun and great priced for being small and off the strip.  The pool can get a little crowded, but the pool bar and hooters restaurant overlooking the pool are fun.\n\nI won't be back until some remodel is done.  Going to try the \""New\"" Tropicana."
"1","On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. \n\nMy feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. \n\nI'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings."
"1","As far as casino hotels go, this one isn't the best and surprisingly the majority of the hooter's girls here aren't even that special or sexy.\n\nI keep coming back for the guaranteed 24/7 $3 blackjack tables that are always fun for me to play at.  I swear I could play for days on end if people don't pry me away."
"1","I know, I know - what would you expect?  Still, no matter how trashy the theme I do expect to get what I paid for.  True, the Hooters casino is as poorly cleaned and maintained as one of their restaurants, but the rooms were not quite so bad as the typical Hooters restroom and one has to expect a certain griminess to go with the low room costs - that could potentially be some of the fun of the aesthetic that Hooters touts, I suppose.\n\nWe came to the Hooters casino because some friends were already booked here and we wanted to spend some time with them after we had rested some, and enjoy exploring Las Vegas.  They, my partner, and I had just spent a week first on a grueling 1900 mile road trip from Austin to northern Nevada and then camping in a barren desert for the Burning Man art festival - and figured it would be nice to spend some time with each other just decompressing.  So we decided we would pay ahead for a room with a bed big enough for both of us, knowing that it would take all day to drive through Nevada from Black Rock Desert to Las Vegas.\n\nWe paid ahead for a room with a King size bed for three nights, got up at 7:30 am and drove all day from Burning Man in North Nevada, got in around 11 pm exhausted and haggard, looking forward to nothing more than just crawling into a clean comfortable bed with each other and relaxing, before spending  - and they tell us that they will only put us in a room with two doubles and told us in a bored voice, \""too bad, even though you paid ahead for a king room, it is first come first served.  Tough, there is nothing we can do, that's policy.\"" In effect, you can only get what you paid for if you come at checkin time - paying for the room ahead of time does not actually secure it.  \n\nOur friends were, of course, screwed over by the same policy and were no happier about it.\n\nAvoid any business that does not deal honestly with its customers like this - this is worse than what you would reasonably expect from Hooters and Las Vegas combined.  I expect trashiness from Hooters and sleazy business practices from Las Vegas - but bait and switch is outside the bounds of any business claiming to be reputable."
"1","Bad #1 Check-in.  had no idea how to enter our reservations in computer,  so we could get our vouchers for free breakfast and so we never got it.   #2 Dirty halls and unmaintained guest rooms. #3 Different drink prices thru same hotel all run by hooters. #4 No free internet. #5 One pool is ice cold. #6 Does not follow up on complaints. #7 No one wins at slot machines. #8 Ghetto towels for pool so you don't steal them. #9. Parking garage is just filthy. #10.  There is no manager it just runs itself!\n\nGood #1 Security.  #2 Price of room when on special. # 3 Good music outside at the one heated pool. #4 Lots of Hooter girls #5 Onion restaurant specials and service  Note: Will probably never go back. Worth the extra money to go elsewhere."
"2","got a great deal online. $20 a night for one room and free steak dinner for two (no purchase necessary, not like other offer that buy one get one free) plus other free slot and table match play. It's like staying for free! \nso no complaints from me.\nroom size is decent and clean , parking is easy, and $3 black jack table for a small time gambler like me is perfect!\nwant to come back here every weekend for this deal!"
"1","For the price I'd say what can one expect. Most cities don't have hotels for as cheap as this one so with that said it's pretty good for that.\n\nI was there for work at night so I didn't do much gambling or walking around. I did end up eating at hooters nearly everyday for not being sure where else to eat and not wanting to be late for work... plus it's not bad so why not :)\n\nSome of the girls weren't very nice... others were super nice and very efficient in their jobs and had actual boobs. Perhaps boobs make one nicer to others? Perhaps some felt they didn't have to be nice because I'm a girl and I'm not drinking so it doesn't matter?\n\nRoom service was fine with cleaning the room until one day a lady came in while I was eating and didn't clean anything else for the rest of my my stay there. I put the please clean sign on the outside of the door before leaving to work at night and when I returned in the morning the sign was gone.\n\nI do understand why ppl might pay a little more though if I do come again with other ppl I'll probably hardly be in my room anyway. Though honestly I probably would've been better off staying at circus circus with all the kids since all I wanted to do in my spare time was visit the arcades any way lol"
"1","Holes in bedroom walls dirty bathrooms. Fun to visit, not to stay! With so many casinos to stay in Vegas, it won't cost much to stay somewhere else."
"1","Hooters should stick to making wings and even that comes into question. They screwed up my food order both nights I was there. The rooms are old and dingy and feels like your sleeping in the restaurant, and the hallways remind me of old, questionable Bates hotel fronts. Honestly, you would be better off staying at the Motel 6 next door. \n\nThe front desk ladies are rude like they hate working there too but have no choice.  The kicker was they cancelled my room after the 1st night even though I was scheduled for three days ---and already had someone booked before I realized my key card didn't work and had to go back to front desk to remind them I'm still in the room. \n\nSave your time and money and please extinguish all options before choosing to stay here."
"1","Hooters. Really? First I did not stay by choice, a special friend booked on priceline and messed it up and got this place for the ever awful price of $80 a night. Epic fail. Parking is a mess, there's a shady lot across the street that is also open for guests. \n\nWe got a double room, went up, it smelled like mildew and the carpet was wet in spots. Seriously? Tile around toilet was multi-colored, not in the good way. It looked like pee stain around the base of the toilet, but it was the messed up tile color. Hole/crack in the sink, way ghetto. We complained, they \""upgraded\"" us to the 15th floor, same room, and gave us some drink coupons for the pool. Tiny beds, halfway between twin and full. Two small Asians in the bed was uncomfortable. Tub/shower clogged and took forever to drain. Cheap tv, no flat screen. But the carpet was better.\n\nFirst time going out we were going down the elevator and this two white trash guys get in with us holding a blunt. Reeked of weed, they start harassing my friend who's on the phone with her family. I tell them to back off and chill and all I remember was them yelling \""Merica.\"" Really? Nice clientele. As we were walking out of the casino behind them, one of these classy gentlemen mooned us bare ass and all. Nice. \n\nThe only saving grace about this place was the pool. Surprisingly nice, and the free drink we got helped. Get the rum frozen drink. Nice and strong. I'd probably give a better review if I didn't pay a ridiculous price, maybe $25 a night and I'd understand. But $80? Hell no. Never again."
"1","This is a review for the restaurant inside of the casino. \n\nI've always been a fan of hooters wings and curly fries. So, after seeing a show we stopped here to eat. My husband and I both got wings. They were cold. Cold enough that they could have been cooked and put in the fridge. \n\nThis is the only hooters that hasn't been spot on with the wings. \n\nService wasn't great either. We got our food and no one came to check on us for 20 minutes and I clearly wasn't eating my food. \n\nAt least the curly fries were good, and warm. \n\nOverall cold food and bad service, and they weren't even busy!"
"1","This place is depressing. They certainly do not live up to their name. And I'm willing to look past that (well, maybe not) but there was just no energy in this place. I twas a Thursday night, and the casino area was dead. It was worse than casinos in Reno. The only reason we came here is because we were staying at the Tropicana and wanted a change. \n\nThe only reason we stayed was because we were hungry and wanted a cheap dinner...wings. We got an assortment of wings, and they were just okay. The waitress was nice, but completely forgettable. It was one of our friend's bday, and all the waitresses were about to sing, but the \""main\"" waitress forgot the song, so they had to go back, teach her, and they came back 20 minutes later. Really??\n\nWe went to a bar which, again on a Thu night, had maybe 10 people in it. And we roll in with our group of 8 and pretty much take over. Again, no fault of the bartender, as he was cool, but the vibe is just sad. \n\nWhen there are so many choices on the strip, I don't think you need to bother with this one."
"1","Really would be a one star, except it has it's bright points (staff who try).  \n\nThe good:  Cheap.  The bad:  Old dirty, smells like a fraternity after a beer brawl.\n\nCould be a five star if you like cheap beer..."
"1","This hotel is so outdated. so you know the saying \""you get what you pay for?\"" We'll that's definitely Hooters guidelines. \nWent with friends for a quick gateway and decided to go cheap on our rooms. Big mistake. Minutes after getting settled we had to request a new room. Bathroom sink was so backed up it smelt like a broken sewage pipe. *barf* \n\""sorry for the inconvenient but we're going to have to give you an evening shitty room\"".. Is basically what happened. \nAfter traveling for 4hours this was the last thing I wanted to deal with. \nNo refrigerators in rooms. That's an extra $25 p/n. AC is really loud and rattles. Old school tube television. My friend even got stuck in the elevator. Lol that was actually funny because she was totally buzzed and had a Final Destination moment. \nRUNDOWN hotel. For sure. \n24 hour pool hours but mainley occupied by kids. \nCustomer service: horrible! Staff at the front desk are extremely rude. In short: Don't do it!!!!!! If you have afford paying a few more dollars, do so!\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
"1","HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! I booked a king strip view room and although the view of the MGM and Tropicana was nice, the room wasn't. Carpets stains, toilet ghost flushing and running constantly all night and A/C kept waking me up when it shut off. This property blows! The analog TV was fuzzy and the bed was too firm for my liking.  The Hooters girls look bored when dealing and don't even smile. The Hooters restaurant also has a poor staff and manager. I wait to be seated and nobody tells me anything, so I seated myself. I order boneless and I get traditional. To top it all off....I booked my room through a popular third party website and at checkout I ask for the total and I am billed a higher price. I tell the employee at the front desk that INCLUDING A RESORT FEE it should be lower (RESORT FEE???? This is no resort) and she just smirks. I ask her to please find out why I'm being billed a higher price and after she kept me waiting forever and she finally comes back and says there was an \""error.\"" No apology. Again this is the Las Vegas of today. Poor customer service. I will never in my life go back to that horrible Hooters hotel in Vegas. It needs to be imploded like many others have been before it. I don't care how cheap it is or close to the strip it is. Stay away!!!!"
"1","Terrible service,  wings are not good and the girls aren't even that hot. Would highly recommend not coming here. I personally will never come back"
"1","I should have read the yelp review before booking, not sure how this place can get away with charging a daily \""resort fee\"" of $14.95. This Motel is far from resort quality with terrible customer service from check in to the Bait Shop and the bartenders and waitresses. Not to mention we were there from thurs-Sunday and the smell of vomit never left the bar area, it didn't smell fresh it smelled like it had soaked into the carpet to remain soiled forever. The rooms are extremely out of date which could have been forgiven do to the low cost of the first two nights and the fact that you aren't in your room very much when in Vegas however when considering the rest of the poor experience we will never return."
"1","I could stand the shit hotel rooms and the even shittier service, like running out of baileys. But when I apparently accidentally put my money on the wrong like in craps, after putting it on the same one a ton of times in a row, and lost? I draw the line there. Such BS. Do not come here if you wanna keep your money."
"2","The food was decent.  I didn't expect to get good Vietnamese food in Las Vegas... This place totally surprised us.  I came here with a large group including some of my uncles and aunts.  You know how Vietnamese elderlies are, they are picky.  And yet, they were happy with the food here.  They love it.  We had pho, hu tieu, bun rieu, bun bo hue, Korean short ribs over tomato rice.  All of them were good."
"1","(-) A \""large\"" bowl of pho looks like a regular bowl of pho to me\n(-) Pricey for the amount you get\n(-) It was an almost-satisfying amount of pho in the large bowl. I'm going to be looking for food in an hour or two\n(-) The Che 3 Mau dessert I got had green jelly that was still slightly frozen -___-\n\nThis place is meh. Nothing too spectacular."
"2","Pretty good pho in considerations of where it is geographically on the US map.\nBeen coming here for years every time I go to Vegas and the best spot for a hangover cure.\n\nService is quick all around from entering to exiting."
"2","Pretty damn good vietnamese food i must say.  Been coming here alot actually this past year and some occasions we'll visit twice in our trip.\n\nPho broth is VERY tasty, meats are fresh.  Mi soup broth is great as well, they give u so many wontons.  2 sizes but both bowls are massive.  Favorite dish there is Com Tam Bi Cha Suong Nuong.  The pork chop is tender/great flavor compared to other spots and their egg cha is superb.  I normally am unimpressed with egg cha at other places even tho i love it, so its awesome that I'm able to enjoy it again.  And their Bi is not overly dry which is great.  \n\nThe restaurant is big and their turn around time for tables are quick even though they get busy alot.\n\nService is a hit or miss.  I mean its a vietnamese restaurant, ur not gonna be catered in royalty.  Just expect your first requests for items to not come and be patient to flag them or someone else down for it again."
"1","NOT RECOMMENDED. \nThe pho was cold and they charged 15% for service without even notifying the customers!!! We didn't even know until the check came out. The ONLY thing the servers did was bring out water and our pho. NOTHING ELSE and they charged 15% for service. NEVER COMING BACK EVER!"
"1","Over- priced for filipino food.  $17 for crispy pata, $2 for a BBQ stick."
"1","mediocre . . . . at best!!!"
"1","Unfortunately, the problem with this restaurant is that everything is precooked.  Went for dinner around 5:30 pm and the pancit was starting to dry out and the pork skewers were so hard and dry we had to wrestle them by hand trying to get them off the skewer.  Those were the only two things we had and we were very disappointed.  This place could be a lot better if dishes were made to order and unless they change we will not go back."
"1","Got a truck off them. Got a car fax. \nPaid for title fee. They fuck that up. Now I have to pay NV DMV to fix it. Now the paper work is late to the bank and the bank up the payment for late. \n\nSlow service. Didn't have paper work ready when they called me to come pick it up.\nThe lady in the front desk was on the phone the whole time I was there taking personal phone calls. Mechs where in the waiting room watching TV. \n\nThey were okay to talk to before giving them a check after that there died to you and service just goes to shit. \n\nI thought I would get better service coming back after a deployment from Afgan. \nNope."
"1","Disappointed is the key word. I was out looking for a new car, really unsure of exactly what I wanted. I know I was looking for a sedan that would be good on cross country trips something comfortable. The young sales person that I was speaking it with suggested maybe a lacrosse or a regal could meet my needs. I told him I would like to test drive one that is regular gas trippin and one that is a crossover since I've never driven a crossover vehicle. It was 105 degrees outside and he took me over to look at SUvs after we had already decided on a sedan. Once we got to the sedan I had to stand outside while he tried to find keys. I walked into the showroom and he was still looking for someone to give him keys to a couple of different vehicles we had picked out. After a few minutes I gave up and walked out, told the young man I would try another day when it was cooler.\n\n I believe some of the young newer sales person should be teamed with a more experienced person looking better answer questions. I don't know anything about the product because I never drove one."
"1","They told me they could fix my car, but when they were done, they found more wrong with it.  A fifth grader could have done better."
"1","They were okay service-wise but they are not sanitary.  Yuck! I don't think they sanitized their tools and if they did it would be an alcohol rinse.  Its too iffy and in retrospect I will not go back.  This is an unwanted nail infection waiting to happen."
"1","I can't believe I'm giving Polish Deli two stars.  I used to love this place.  Alas, something has gone horribly wrong.  Rows and rows of empty shelves.  Diminished selection.  What happened??\n\nI used to stop by Polish Deli regularly.  Then, I got lazy, and ended up just going to Euro Delicacies because it was closer to my house.  In the interim, however, Euro Delicacies has surpassed them with selection of Polish goods.  Polish Deli still has the biggest selection of pierogi and Polish meats in town, but that's not saying much.\n \nYou can also pick up Polish teas, over-the-counter drugs, and Wedel chocolates, something I haven't seen elsewhere in town (which are in the refrigerators because it's like 90 degrees in the store).  I'll still stop by for my blueberry pierogi and kapusta czerwona (red cabbage salad) but, then again, maybe I won't.  Seriously depressing."
"2","Great breakfast food at OPH.  Had the Belgin Waffles with a side of bacon.  The bacon was thick & delicious.  Ok, I don't get bacon often.  The Belgin Waffle was light and had a good taste.\n\nIf you are a grandparent or grandchild (55+, 12 & under) they have a good deal.  Under $5 for 3 pancakes, eggs & meat.\n\nI recommend eating here vs. the breakfast buffet ($8).  The food tastes better."
"1","My husband and I used to eat at this restaurant all the time.  We always loved the food.  However, the last time we were there , the manager disagreed with where we asked to be seated based on the placement of our highchair.  We did not realize that it was a problem.  Afterall, the hostess sat us there.\n\nWhen the manager saw what happened, he aggressively approached our table, rapped his knuckles on the table, and loudly imformed us that \""this was never happening again\"".  You betcha, Buddy, because after being chewed out by this manager like I was a tardy dishwasher, we weren't coming back.  I was angry and embarassed as this manager was loud enough that people at other tables were staring at us, so I emailed the restaurant's corporate offices right there from my phone.\n\nA few days later, I received a phone call from the restaurant's general manager.  I think that her name was Lisa. At first, I thought that Lisa was going to work this out with me, perhaps apologize for her underling's poor behavior. That just wasn't going to happen.  What Lisa gave me was a second butt chewing.  She interrupted me time and again, and even accused me of being a bad mother because the placement of the highchair was dangerous and against city code, that she was more concerned about the safety of my child than I was.  Had she stopped talking over me for 2 seconds, she would have learned that my husband is an architect and has forgotten more about building and city codes than some diner manager would ever know.  What she didn't know that my husband did know was that the placement of the highchair was well within city egress requirements.\n\nShe then claimed to have reviewed the tape of the manager approaching our table and she that the table rapping never happened.  She was lying.  It did happen.  I saw it.  My husband saw it, and my baby jumped when he did it.  She either did not review the tape or there was no tape to review.  I seriously doubt that they have cameras trained on every table in any restaurant, much less a pancake diner.  \n\nDuring this entire conversation, I kept trying to get a word in edgewise to complain about the way the first manager all but yelled at us.  It was awful, and soon as she was done verbally abusing me, she said goodbye and HUNG UP on me.  I was shocked.  She never had any intention of working this out.  Her intention was to bully me for daring to complain about one of her co-workers.  And sadly, we have lost one of our favorite breakfast spots because I will not contribute a nickel to that woman's salary.\n\nI had heard, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that several restaurants in casinos had recently closed their doors.  If this is how they allow their manager to speak to people, I am not the least bit surprised.  I have since told everyone I know about the abuse that I suffered at this woman's hands and will continue to bad mouth this restaurant every opportunity I get."
"2","Tried many Chinese buffets in town and this one is the best of the dozen or so in Vegas. They do have pretty fresh ingredients. They do switch some of their lunch dishes out during dinner so you don't feel like your paying more for only lunch items. For dinner you get more of the seafood dishes like, shrimps, mussels, lobsters, crabs and fish.  Overall taste of all the dishes is consistent. We've been dining at this buffet from time and time again for the past two years and haven't been disappointed. They do have a good selection of dishes, with a decent sushi, fresh fruits, dessert and a Mongolian BBQ station. It's more of a locals buffet so don't expect it to be like a fancy buffet at one of the strip's hotel. The food is good and the price is reasonable, what more can you ask for."
"1","Negative stars for this place!!! This use to be one of mine and best friend's spot to eat. On one of our regular trips (we love the crab legs...) needless to say, the eyeball on my crab was still there looking at me and my friend found what looked to be a nose hair in her won ton soup. \n\nWe both left in a hurry and made sure no one saw us because we still had full plates of food and were afraid to be charged extra. We proceeded to throw up in front of the restaurant. \n\nNEVER AGAIN. We are very sadden by the fact that one of our favorite spots is RUINED for us."
"1","I don't know why they're always so busy, the food was horrible! They make you pay on the way in and then you're stuck! Do not recommend!"
"2","Out of all the Asian buffets I Love Buffet at Asia the best, they have good quality food that's fresh and delicious. Their food actually has flavor, not bland like most of your food at the buffets. Buffets usually go for quantity not quality but here at Buffet at Asia they go for quality and they have a pretty good selection of food too. My favorite thing about this restaurant is one of their selections they offer for their beverages, and that is that they have Thai Iced Tea. Everybody knows that this beverage usually goes for about $4-$5 dollars for a small glass and at Buffet at Asia it's unlimited, how great is that??? well it's great for people who enjoy this beverage.\n\nAnyways, I think this place is pretty good especially for being a buffet and an Asian one at that so give it a try next time your near one of their locations. BTW, I don't recommend going to the one at Flamingo near Maryland, IDK why but I just personally don't care for that location."
"1","So once every few years I think to myself \""hey maybe I should go to a cheap Chinese buffet\"" and then more often than not I regret my decision. This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back."
"2","Most amazing school! Teachers care... Staff is amazing & professional.... The level of care is incomparable to any other school in NV... Have 2 kids here. Blessed! Highly reccomend. My kid absolutely love school!!"
"1","(This happened in August of 2013, I was hesitant to post because I believe justice needs to happen in this case, but my honey is just glad to be alive and hasn't pursued the issue any further, so I must respect his wishes.  Dr.  Yee's mistake needs to be out there for future patients to know!  Oh and not to mention the $500 & $1200 hospital bills we've had to pay because this doctor rushed thru his SURGERY!). \n\nWow!  I received a reply from the \""owner\"" of Westfield and he didn't even apologize for the life threatening mistake that happened in his building by one of his doctors!  At least Dr Yee did show a bit of compassion for cutting too deep and hitting an artery and called to see how he was feeling the next day.  You sir should be a shamed of yourself.  \n\nWorst experience ever.  My fianc\u00e9 went in yesterday for a chalazion removal surgery on his left upper eyelid.  The appt was for 4pm, obviously Dr. Yee's last appt of the day, a we were the last ones in the waiting room.  Our kids were with us so my fianc\u00e9 went back to the surgery room alone.  The procedure was done quickly and he was done within 10-15 min.  We were given no discharge papers or explanation of what to and not to expect an care for the wound after surgery.  We were told \""it's a very simple procedure\"".  \nDriving home from Westfield about 5 minutes in, blood started dripping heavily out of my fiance's eyepatch.  We immediately called the office, which was now closed, and told the operator the situation and asked for the doctors immediate response.  Operator said he'd have the doc call.  So we continued driving.  We live across the street from Summerlin hospital and once we got near it we knew the blood leakage was not normal and we stopped in to the emergency room.  He was immediately taken in to the ER and they tried to stop the blood flow.  20 minutes after speaking to Westfield's operator I received the call back and spoke to Dr Yee who said to me \""you're wasting your time going to the ER, you just need to put pressure on it for a few minutes.\""\nI was livid.  The nurses put pressure on his eye for 5 hours!  Yes 5 hours ad having blood & blood clots pour out of his eyelid.  The ER doctors didn't know what to do and attempted to contact Dr Yee for help.  We arrived at the ER at 5:15pm, Dr Yee didn't show up until 9pm.  After a short period of prepping to do surgery Dr Yee went to work trying to fix the problem he created.  It took an hour and 30 minutes of excruciating pain and suffering for the doc to stop the bleeding.  I am grateful that my fianc\u00e9 was finally fixed and is home resting, but I am so upset and disturbed by the lack of care Dr Yee presented during the initial surgery.  He must have had a long day and rushed through the chalazion removal, which caused him to cut too deep and rupture an artery.  \nThis has not only caused physical pain, but also mental and emotional suffering for our whole family, especially my fianc\u00e9.\nThanks for reading this, I hope you choose to take care of your eyes at a more upstanding caring and professional eye center."
"2","If you are uptight and bitchy, don't come here! Go to a place that charges a cover and $12 for a well drink.  If you can relax and enjoy yourself without worrying if someone's LOOKING at you, this is a fun place to go to. Wed nights are biker nights. If you have a bike, then you know what to expect. I go on Tues nights, which is Hot Rod Tues brought to you by one of the main Mutts at Mutt & Jeff's Classics. The parking lot gets packed with classics, rat rods, and even some bikes. So what if the chick behind the bar wears her underwear to work??? What ever makes her the extra cash. And it's not like she's a beast! She's very nice. And don't complain about the owner being a skirt chaser. Take it as a compliment! You can say 'no thank you' and he'll be fine, and so will you, geez! Like I said, if  it's easy for you to get your panties in a bunch, don't go. Simple. Their food is delicious and on Tuesday nights, it's the best $1 tacos short of making your own at home, and even then I think you've got some competition!!! Full bar, sports on the flat screens, rockin juke box. Hey, ever since The Cooler Lounge closed, this is pretty darn close to the good times we had there!!! Everyone is super nice."
"1","Its been a year since my last review, this location is doing as good job as they can but the new menu is falling flat.  Bring the classics back.  Please."
"1","Everytime I visit there I wait at least 45 minutes before I make it through the waiting room door. Dr. Arnold has removed cancer from me twice. This last time I waited for 90 minutes and never made it through the door. Three other people who were there before me were still waiting. He gets high marks in skill. His office staff rates a zero for overbooking and rudeness. His bedside manner could use improving but his skill level outweighs that. His skill level does not excuse the length of time waiting. Doctor you are Fired!"
"2","Needed coveralls for last minute Halloween costume and staff was very helpful and let me know they had item I was looking for over the phone. They even held it for me at the front of the store so I was in and out in under 5 min!!! Great customer service!!!"
"1","Update: This Winchells that I reviewed  on N. Decatur  has now closed and is now Dulce Donuts.    I hope to go over to Dulce Donuts soon and try them.  (the two stars are for the Winchells that was here. I just wanted to update so everyone knows that it is now closed)"
"2","Dr. Singel and his staff did a wonderful job!  I went to see him about a bone cyst and pathalogical fracture and he was in the room with me within 10 minutes of my appt time and he had already reviewed my info and checked out the MRI films I brought.  He knew exactly what I needed and referred me to an excellent orthopedic surgeon to get my foot taken care of.  His office was super quick in putting in the referral to my insurance company.  They were polite, knowledgeable, and professional and didn't keep me sitting around.  Thanks, Dr. Singel!"
"1","Find another loan officer, quickly.\n\nMy loan officer not only was condescending and rude (at lunch I'd have her on speakerphone so I had witnesses to her attitude, her interruptions, and her inconsistencies), but forgot several key elements that held up my close.  She did not order the appraiser who mandated repairs be made to come back, she never let me know the charges of the appraisals until after my card was charged without my permission, she sent me to the underwriter without ever reading the report that stated that several documents were missing and then blamed it on someone else, then finally was so rude with me I hung up on her, called my realtor, and told him if she contacted me again I was reporting her to the board.\n\nToday, I get notice that my homeowner's policy she arranged with an insurance company CANCELED my policy (a condition of my mortgage) and is sending me the refund of the difference.  Apparently my loan officer dropped that ball, too.\n\nI was told several times that without her, I'd be \""dead in the water\"" due to a bankruptcy eight years ago and a late student loan payment four years after that (due to a divorce and frozen assets), and that without her, I wouldn't have a loan.  Odd--I then talked to two other loan officers at two other places who couldnt understand why the loan officer had me pay $30 for court docs NONE of them needed b/c it was EIGHT years ago, and after seven, no one really looks at it.  \n\nShe was incompetent, I still continue to have to deal with the pieces from her dropping the ball, she was rude, she cost me money and time.  Oh--and even after the delay of escrow, where I did not get occupancy, guess who didn't adjust the interest??  You guessed it.  When your realtor has to go down to the office to try to fix things, you know you have a bad deal.  \n\nGo elsewhere. Anywhere."
"1","came here after dinner with some friends. \n\nmain issue is:\n\ni think the owner (an asian dude) was wearing crocs without socks while making and serving food.\n\n\n\nthe portions were generous, my blizzard was overflowing. awesome. but then while we were eating we all got this whiff of ASS. i looked at my friends and they looked at me like \""did you do it?\"" finally we looked over at the only other people who were an old couple a few tables away from us and they looked over at us like \""do you smell that?\"" finally we all started laughing and said it must be their sewer pipe or something. we already finished our stuff but overheard the wife of the elderly couple say \""ugh... how can you eat that with that smell?\"" hahaha we all got up and left. everyone was laughing while we walked out the door."
"1","This place is the definition of repugnant. I understand when a mistake happens once or twice when it is busy, but I have gone here multiple times and during those multiple times, my order and the service have been not at it's best. For example, I have ordered fries and they told me it was going to be a few minutes because they make everything fresh, but when I got the fries, they were cold and undercooked. Secondly, when I order a blizzard, the amount of toppings in very light. Thirdly, filthy filthy filthy. I am not surprised that I saw a C rating in their lobby. Overall, I will no longer go out of my way to this place is to eat."
"1","Tuesday night sweet tooth went unsatisfied as we started to order some frozen desserts.  Only to be shot down with, \""I'm sorry but we're out of ice cream tonight\"". WHAT?  Are you kidding me?  Plenty of other spots to go for dessert and we will not be coming back here."

"1","I have been to this school a few times to take tests and they way they do things is very old fashion I must say for Vegas. Computers I thought were taking over the world? Well I hope so since that is where my career lies.\n\nSo you do your paperwork at the front which is filled with young adults that don't really know what they are doing. They sit there and ask each other for help. I don't know what that is all about. Do they get paid or this is for credits? \n\nThey make you fill out paperwork and then send you over to the cashier. The cashier knows what they are doing at least. Then the cashier gives you a piece of paper, saying you paid for your test and then you walk back over to the front desk to show them the piece of paper. Is anyone following how time consuming and old fashion this is? \n\nOk so I move to a different address. I know I have to be there early so I can change my address before my test. I give proof of address with a bill in hand but they say I don't need that. So then I give my I.D. to them which also has my new address on it. He takes it and goes scans it, I guess to put it in my file. They make me filled out new paperwork. Then once that is all done I head to the testing room, and even tell the teacher I have a new address. She writes it down. On my test, it asks if I had any changes since my last test, and there's a option for new address. I check it. I even filled it out on the test. Now I am pretty confident my results will get to my new address.\n\nOne month later, I still haven't gotten my results in the mail yet. I was patient enough and decided to call to see what was going on. The young male adult that answered the phone kept putting me on hold to look for my test and when I took it. \n\nSo he finds my paperwork and starts reading off my old address. I started laughing in frustration. I explained what I went through, that morning to make sure everything was going to be sent to me. I wasn't mean or nasty with him.  laughed a lot thought because I couldn't believe this was happening. I asked if he could changed it over the phone and that was of course no. I must go back to the school and change my address and also get my test results there too. \n\nSo my scanning of my I.D. was missing, and all the new sheets I filled out were just gone? He also tells me that he would of remember scanning my I.D. because he was there that day of the test. \n\nI hung up on him. I couldn't take it anymore. He made me look like I was lying. How frustrating is that. \n\nSo I am still in the unknown about my results. I haven't been able to make it down to the school since I don't have a car. It's really not easy to get to in my situation. \n\nI am finding another school quickly. Will not give them anymore of my money!!  \n\nThanks CSN for all the drama."
"1","Hoo boy... if you're looking for the tool section Crowbar is for you.  Somewhere between a gas station and tattoo shop in a strip mall in northwest las vegas is where you'll find this magnet for fauxhawks and lower back tattoos.  I haven't been here in years and don't plan on changing that anytime soon.  Parking is not a problem, the venue is large enough and has the same selection of booze you'll find at any neighborhood bar.  However, it's the clientele that earns this place a lonely star."
"2","My favorite place outside of my house!! Check it out, youll understand why!!"
"2","Great food! Best wings in town. Ohio State football? This is the place to be to watch the game."
"2","Just left this office and I've never been so impressed by a dental visit before!\nNew patient paperwork was minimal, wait time was barely enough to read 2 pages of my book, and I was introduced to Anita- the cheerful, friendly, and professional dental assistant with who I would spend the majority of my visit. \n\nAnita was downright bubbly and made an effort to get to know me as a person while also maintaining professionalism, explaining every procedure she was going to do, and giving additional dental info tidbits to help keep my teeth as healthy and attractive as possible. Dr. Ozaki was also super professional and made sure to go over my concerns before moving on, making it very clear that he could always be reached in the event of an emergency. Anita mentioned she has worked for Dr. Ozaki for decades, which I think speaks volumes about their level of professionalism and patient care.\n\nUltimately spent just over an hour here including xrays, cleaning, and scheduling additional work for a chipped tooth. Front desk staff were super helpful at answering some questions about my dental insurance coverage and went out of their way to look up pricing to replace a retainer. Super impressed with the staff here, and that's what will keep me coming back."
"2","Love the food and the staff are always nice. The garlic knots are great, the rolls are great and a great price for the amount of food. We have never had an issue with delivery. Never been to NY, but the pizza is thin and good sized slices. The caprese salad is excellent."
"1","I give it 2 stars for bring open on Sunday, but it's really only worth 1 star.  The employees are nice, but everything is computerized and it makes me think that they work on commission.  They tried to sell me things I had previously purchased and they kept lowering the price by a dollar and saying \""so now do you want it?\""  I just came for an oil change.  I expected to be told about what else needs to be done, but other places which actually care about the user experience will print you a list of needs and their prices.  That would have been respectable instead of trying to intimidate you with a computer.  Hahaha, don't even try it buddy:/\nI ended up waiting about an hour and a half to even be seen, but when I called the girl told me I could get an oil change right away:/. When I called I asked to make an appointment.  This place is like a snake.  I. Wouldn't necessarily blame it in the employees, I'd blame it on jiffy lube.  I do NOT recommend coming here unless like me, ur oil is in sure need of change on a Sunday:("
"2","Welcome to Italy or at least our own little slice of it. Forget the Venetian and it faux decor. This is the real thing. This shop has a vibe unlike any other Italian restaurant I have been in. Doubling as an Italian deli the restaurant itself sells quality Italian food at wallet friendly prices. The food here is what I'd expect a home cooked meal to taste like... If I was an Italian... In Italy. The portions are very generous, and the food itself is always freshly cooked and delicious. \n\nFurthermore, the service is top notch. You feel as though you've stepped once again into an Italian household invited to dinner. The workers due their utmost in providing the best service with a smile and a few jokes at that. \n\nThe deli serves some of the best Italian cold cuts from various types of prosciutto and capicolla. They also serve a delicious assortment of cheeses and cold dishes. \n\nComing here you are welcomed into the heart of Italy. From food at the table to the food sold at the deli you can't go wrong. The service is top notch and the restaurant is very clean. So if your looking for some great Italian food, you don't have to look so far."
"2","I reeeeeeally needed new tires. Despite being fully aware of this, I took a 50-mile bumpy-ass dirt road into the middle of Death Valley to a remote hot springs. There was no cell service, and I carried no spare -- what can I say, I like to live on the edge :)\n\nSure enough, I hadn't been back in town more than a few days when I blew out a tire. Thank dog it didn't happen in the middle of Death Valley! I went over to the Big O on Jones & Desert Inn, where I've been going for years...but unfortunately the place was closed, because the cool-ass man who ran it had passed away :(\n\nSo I went to another Big O, which shall remain nameless...and after upselling me on needless services (transmission fluid, power steering fluid and brake fluid flushes), the guy had the chutzpah to call me up the next day and ask me out on a date!!\n\nNow I can't fault the guy for asking me out -- after all, my usual m.o. when going in for automotive work is to wear skimpy clothes in order to wangle the best deal from the grease monkeys. But to rip me off and THEN have the balls to ask me out?! Inconceivable!\n\nI know they ripped me off, because my regular oil-change guy later told me he'd just changed my power steering fluid a few months prior...so it DEFINITELY did not need flushing. Lesson learned: check records before agreeing to services!\n\nAnyhoo, now I decided to get a full set of new tires, just in case. But I sure as hell wasn't going back to Big O! Someone recommended Discount Tire, so I went and checked it out.\n\nThe staff was courteous, the waiting room was airy, clean, and stocked with lots of magazines, and one of the grease monkeys offered me a bottle of water while I waited. The total cost for all the tires only came to $340, and I was in and out within 30 minutes.\n\nThis all just happened today, so I'm still waiting to see if these insanely cheap tires blow up prematurely. I'm also waiting to see if anyone calls to ask me out! \n\nBarring those eventualities...this place rocks!"
"2","Thanks to yelp! Otherwise I would have not found this place. The service here is great and fair prices. I watched two other customers pay for their service and they both seemed happy when they finished. As soon as I walked in, another customer asked if I had been there before (no) and immediately started saying how fair the prices were and how great the service was. This is NOT a franchise. The owner is there everyday at the front desk and most of the time you deal with him direct. Incredible place and they deserve all the support and great reviews they have."
"2","I am 84 and have been retired from Ford Motor Company  for 30 years, after spending 30 years in several management positions, this past Friday (2-28-14), I had my 2008 Mercury Grand Marquis brakes serviced at Mr. Brake. I must say that the Owner/Manager and his Service Staff are the most honest and trustworthy people I have ever encountered at any service shop. I highly recommend that anyone needing brake service would be well served to have your work done at this location.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by Bill, he immediately took my vehicle into the shop, checked out the problem, gave me a very reasonable estimate, made the required repairs on a very timely basis, gave me the final bill which was exactly as the  estimate, and I was on my way within an hour, it just does not get any better than at Mr Brake...  Russ D"
"2","I do a lot of driving.  This was further compounded by a few cross-country roadtrips over the last few months (A man's gotta travel).  I certainly put the mileage on my brakes and rotors, and there comes that time that your car will remind you of that.\n\nThere's no gentle way of putting this: Car repairs suck, but I am glad that I found Mr. Brake.\n\nI made an appointment with Mark, who was a really nice guy over the phone.  I did an early morning appointment, brought my car in, and let them do their thing.\n\nIt cost  A little more than I was expected, but it was due to me putting my car through more of its paces than I should have.  The team made sure that I saw everything, explained why it was, and they really made sure that I understood what they were doing before affecting any repairs.  I am not a huge car-minded guy, so I do appreciate someone laying out everything in a very direct manner.  Best of all, they fixed everything (front and back brakes and rotors) within 30 minutes.\n\nThe car is running fine, and I am happy with my service.  I consider their work thorough and honest, in addition to their polite and friendly manner.\n\nI can see why this brake place is a wall of 5 Stars.  I would gladly use their service again."
"1","Nothing remarkable about this place. \n\nThe foot quality was good, but our food wasn't all that well prepared.  I ordered a spicy chicken dish, and I didn't taste much spice above and beyond the sweet and sour sauce with some dried red chilis.\n\nThe service was good here, but we were one of 3 tables..."
"2","has a lot of variety of dim sum if you go early. One thing i hate about this place and prevent me from giving it a 5 stars because those ladies who pushed the carts, they're so pushy in trying to put food on your table, there are a lot of things i don't like to eat, and they just placed those plates on my table even though i said i don't want its. Give me time to pick out the dishes i want to order, will ya???"
"1","I hate to give bad reviews but this place was definitely NOT GOOD.\nThe food here wasn't very flavorful and I'm not super picky on flavor. The chicken looked and tasted like it maybe wasn't chicken... There was a fish tank full of dead fish on display for the diners to see, gross. \n\nThere's millions of places to get Chinese food in Chinatown so I would not recommend this one. \n\nAlso I got sick to my stomach almost instantly after we finished eating. I usually prefer food that doesn't make me sick."
"2","First time going to this place, the food was great ordered the lo mein and beef with strawberry sauce.  Also ordered a couple of dim sum dishes - shu mai and hargow.  Definitely a place to come back again, the dim sum I think is a bit pricey imho."
"1","[Review for DIMSUM only]\n\nI'm sure you've needed to buy a car - a brand-spanking-new one OR a semi-whored-out-used version - at one point in your life and have experienced a nagging-dying-to-complete-a-sale-to-take-out-a-chick-salesperson. It wasn't the greatest of experiences right?\n\nWell, meet the DIMSUM version.\n\nI really wonder if these ladies work here on a full commission basis OR have been set STRICT ASIAN QUOTAS (those having worked overseas OR know someone who does may have learnt at some point how some retail outlets staff actually have DAILY quotas to meet...OR else ADIOS bish). They sure fly around in their dimsum carts like the establishment is a go-cart-track...and pushing for sales a LOT more aggressively than I would say a carsalesperson would at the end of the month.\n\nBest part? The moment they knew I spoke Chinese...they went gung-ho-YOU-need-MORE-meat-on-you-SON-\""YOUTOOSKINNNNNNNNNNNNNY\"" on me. (Bish, please...you look anoxeric! Maybe?) Well, they still WON...since I tend to be a pushover with asian-aunties-battling-menopause and their dimsum carts...and found my small table for 2 with food for at least 5 gargantuan eaters.\n\nYet, this place, which was recommended by locals (asian ladies that you'd find working at the hotels and casinos that I randomly started conversations with to ask for tips on LOCAL food joints), isn't that great. (I think I got trolled.)\n\nOilier dimsum...below average quality (just seems like the food sat out a little too long as well as tasting rather bland...)...and ISN'T PIPING HOT...meh\n\nBut what really killed it for me was this ever present sour taste that wasn't vinegar...and if you know your dimsum (OR even any other food in general)...this ISN'T A GOOD SIGN. Maybe, the health department might have to come over for an (S)INspection...before, as comedian Russel Peters imitates his dad, \""Somebody Gonna Get a Hurt Real Bad\"".\n\nIf you're craving dimsum, I'd say...just wait until you get out of Vegas and hit a real spot instead. And if you HAVE to be here, please don't order the dimsum BUT order ala carte dishes instead - at least if the food isn't that fresh, the raging fire under the wok will fudgingly kill everything in it.\n\nIt may just save you a trip to the porcelain throne of shame. (Don't ask)."
"1","So many better places on Spring Mountain.  One dish tastes likes the next at this joint.  The \""white\"" chicken is anything but.  Cathay was once one of the best in town.  Not any more.  As they say, \""no more business from me to you!\"""
"1","\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" \nFrom the Cathay House of about 2 or 3 years ago, no less. I wonder what happened? Cathay House used to be a go-to for my friends and family, but somehow the overall quality has been declining, and this last visit made us realize that. \n\nThe dishes now have simple, fundamental issues with them, like very thick dumpling skin that sticks to the dish, and vegetables that are not very fresh and crisp. The tea was clearly oversteeped. The highlight of the meal was actually the tripe, which was very clean and had great texture. Have prices creeped up over the years? We racked up a $70 bill for what didn't seem like very much food, especially in between all the limp veggies and half-filled dishes.\n\nThe service and cleanliness have also gone downhill; where I feel like Cathay House used to clearly be the nicest dim sum place in Chinatown, I can no longer say the same. While the servers are fairly patient and accommodating as usual, one of our party observed that some of kitchen staff don't perform the required hand wash after a bathroom visit, and that they were talking on their cellphones in the kitchen! I'm not sure what to think, between being disappointed, and being hopeful that Cathay would return to its former glory, but I do know that for the first time we'll be looking for a new dim sum place."
"2","This is my go to place when I crave semi good cheap junk food.  They have specials through out the week I do enjoy their sundaes its similar to McDonald's chili cheese fries are not bad and the chili cheese burger is pretty decent.  So if you're craving your once in a while junk food lol check out.  Xoxo. Your fellow yelpie"

The warm sourdough type bread with the warm ham... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good. \n\nThis place is old and run down.  The service sucks.  But if you want some Schlotzcky's this is it!"
"1","Cheap food and quality. Nice counter help. It is just another fast food place."
"2","Brought my dually ranch truck in today and they did a great job!  It was full of hay, dog and horse hair dirt and grime! It cost $160 but they worked on it for 4 hours!! They didn't get it perfect but so close and for as bad as it was I will give it to them!  Will be back and it will be way cheaper if I don't let it get so out of hand....."
"1","After a positive experience with Dr. Davis and his office, I brought my expensive Calvin Klein sunglasses in to get a new set of lenses. When I got them back, the lenses didn't seem right. I asked the optician to look at them and she did something with the right arm and she broke it! Her attitude was, you signed a release and your screwed! We're not responsible even though the glasses broke when she was working with them. I was very upset with the lack of s caring attitude and hiding behind a release form. I am left with the opinion that once they get their money from VSP, game over. I had to take my broken sunglasses to a frame repair place and pay $65 cash to get them fixed. VSP did reimburse the $65 to me because they do care about their customers, unlike Dr. Davis and his staff. The take away from this experience is that Dr. Davis is a good eye doctor but his business practices leave a bit to be desired! Definitely do not use his office to get new lenses on your exiting frames. He will not stand by them if anything happens! Unfortunately in today's world, good customer service is hard to find. It's all about the $$$ and not the customer."
"1","I used to LOVE this place. I mean \""go there several times a week\"" kind of love but lately it seems deals have decreased as well as portion sizes. I was addicted to their wings and would stock up on them regularly. The sad little party wings they serve now (For the same price mind you!) are actually kind of insulting."
"1","Decided to try this place today since it was new in the neighborhood....It was terrible!  I ordered the chicken avocado wrap and I personally do not eat avocado or carrots so I asked for it without avocados or carrots. As I was walking out of the store I looked around and noticed that two of the what I have to assume owners cars were parked directly in front of the restaurant taking up guest parking including a spot that isn't even parking. When I got home sat down to eat and opened my food up I was totally disappointed, they got my order wrong, I was hungry so I started to eat around what I didn't like the chicken was dry and had very little flavor. So I gave the other half of my wrap to my husband who isn't picky at all and he didn't even like it. I definitely will not go back! Not to mention I paid $13 for the wrap and a soda...which is wayyyyy to pricey for the quality."
"1","mmmmm...,,,,mmm... bad! This place was definitely not what a majority of my co-workers had described it.  How can you burn chicken that bad? Here are my ratings for their service:\n\nCustomer Service - 5 Stars\nChicken Pasta - 1 Star (only because the chicken wasn't burnt)\nMashed Potatoes - 1/2 Star (only for the effort)\n\nI ordered the family 4 meal and it was terrible.  I was hoping to write a good review, but the chicken pasta was soaked in thousand island dressing.  Not a huge fan of thousand island sauce unless i can use it on my \""In & Out\"" burger.  \n\nMashed Potatoes? Sooooooo disappointed, they covered my mashed potatoes with gravy for me so when i got home it had all blended in together.  Husband was not happy.  \n\nChicken was very bland in seasoning, but thanks to the charred areas, there was a burnt taste at least.  \n\nI wish I could say more about the place, but unfortunately \""this is all she wrote\""."
"2","mark & mercedes are a must listen to in the morning."
"1","Worst Starbucks I have EVER been in! I walked in at 7:10am. There were 6 employees behind the counter and I was the only customer in the building. I walk up to the register area and one employee starts wiping down the espresso machine. She makes eye contact with me then looks away! No hello or anything. Another employee had her back to me the entire time talking to the girl that ignored me, never once turned around! The other 4 employees were playing some kind of game running around laughing and tagging or touching each other behind the counter. After standing there for 2 minutes, (felt like 20!) I asked if I could order a coffee. The girl with her back to me walks to the back room, the girl wiping down the machine turns her back to me, 3 of the 4 playing grab ass start acting like they are putting things away. Finally one of them asks for my order. I order my coffee and move over to the pick up window. The girl puts my coffee up after a few minutes and doesn't say a word. I ask, \""is this mine\"", to which she replies \"" I guess\"".\nIf I didn't need that coffee, I would have just walked out! Avoid this crap box at all costs!!"
"1","Not enough employees at this location. Had to wait 30,min for an employee to assist me in the fabric department, if Hobby Lobby was open on Sundays I would have went there. Not my normal location."
"1","The only reason we used to come here every week was for the food. Needless to say the got rid of the best menu items they had again. They used to serve pizza - gone! Chicken avacado club sandwich ?  gone too! The only decent salad they had on the menu the chicken avacado with garlic...took it off the menu This place sux now & we certainly will not be back ever!"
"1","These two stars are basically for ambiance and fantastic food.  Service is average at best, pool is free but the only thing more broken than the pool sticks is the pool tables themselves.  The beer selection is the worst for someone who values good beer, thank you but if my elite choice is a magic hat #9...  Even being with in walking distance to my house and the choice for my gambling induced friends, I would never go here and rarely do."
"2","While this is no Pebble Beach, this course is beautiful and the pricing is very competitive!  When I am not golfing, I walk this course almost nightly with my dog because it is a beautiful oasis in the Las Vegas desert (the exercise is nice too!).  The course tours the player through the entire Rhodes Ranch residential development with recurrent water features beginning on the 3rd hole.  \n\nThe greens are challenging with hazards and roughs found on every hole, but also with wide open fairways to keep the newer player's morale up.  The pro staff are incredibly friendly and almost every golf package includes 2 free draft beers- you can never go wrong with that!\n\nThe course was looking unusually ragged this summer, but it reopens from over seeding tomorrow and is a crisp, rich green again.  If you are a golfer, the membership cannot be beat.  Around $30/month with free range use and cart fee only greens fees in the mornings and afternoons!\n\nThis is a great course and I doubt anyone who plays it will be disappointed!"
"2","I've been frequenting Panera Bread locations around Vegas for YEARS. In my opinion, this location stands out as the cleanest and most consistently delicious with the most friendly staff! The staff are always smiling and eager to take your order, speaking to you like you're an old friend! \n\nI stopped in here this morning to grab a quick bagel and coffee before work. I rarely eat bagels, but have been craving one for weeks. I ordered Asiago Cheese, toasted, with cream cheese and a large coffee. Coffee is self serve (unless you order a latte) and I really enjoy their Hazelnut brew! I also ordered a pumpkin spice latte for my girlfriend. \n\nBagels were ready in just a few minutes and always taste fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that the cream cheese comes in a small container and you have to put it on your bagel yourself. This is a bit inconvenient for me as I prefer the grab and go style quickie breakfast. \n\nWhen I drop in for a quick lunch/dinner, I always go for the \""you pick two\"" option because I can never decide between soup or sandwich/panini. I don't think I've ever not enjoyed a sandwich from here. Everything is always made fresh with quality ingredients (meats, cheese, veggies). Also, you CANNOT go wrong w/ the broccoli cheese soup - yummy!!!!\n\nALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order a side of french baguette. Trust me, it tastes like heaven!"
"1","Came in for a quick to go order the staff was talking amongst them selves and yelling across the restaurant jokingly. \n\nI tried to order the a bread bowl but they were out of the bowls. The girl offered to comp me extra prices of bread to go with it so it so I ordered. I get my order and \""the entire store is out of bread\"". It was kind of like oh well we are out. I came later so I kind of understand the lack of bowls but they offered something they couldn't follow through with which was annoying. The store overall just had a very unprofessional atmosphere which was irritating. I feel like I paid $6 for a small cup of soup from a bunch of kids which wasn't the experience I anticipated. Will probably continue to go to the boca park location from now on."
"2","This place is like a way better version of the circus circus steak house. Not cheap but less expensive than most and a good selection of dry aged prime steaks grilled perfect.  They are not reinventing anything here, they have the typical sides and salads but they are executed very well.  We also had a particularly friendly waiter and good service. \n\nBelieve it or not it is hard to find a place in Vegas that serves multiple cuts of dry aged prime steaks, most have one or two signature cuts and the rest are \""wet aged\"" (especially filets) or they want to charge you ridiculous by the ounce prices for some specialty beef, not here.  The menu says all the steaks are prime and dry aged (I asked when I made the reservation too).   \n\nI had the bone in rib eye 20oz, it had a nice mild aged beef flavor and was 44 bucks.  My guest had the surf and turf, 6oz filet with half a butter poached lobster tail on top for 46 bucks, good deal.  The lobster was cooked absolutely perfectly and was especially delicious. The sides were real tasty but nothing revolutionary, however the creamed spinach was delicious and probably the best I have ever had. All the sides were 7 bucks which is cheap when compared and big enough to share.   \n\n I didn't give then 5 stars because nothing blew my mind, there are some great, albeit more expensive, steakhouses out there that are doing some real interesting things. If you want a great cut of meat with some great traditional sides and no nonsense go here for sure."
"1","Meh, my filet was overcooked, service was slow. Ambiance was nice but ..nothing really special. The sides were a la carte. If you're looking for a good steakhouse, look elsewhere."
"2","Very tasty filet. Service was good...others enjoyed their prime rib and short ribs. Only complaint was too much dressing on the Caesar. Would recommend if you're in Vegas."
"2","At the end of this review, I will share a tip on how to save 50% off your entrees.\n\nThe night before I was booked for The Range, I had the most horrible experience for dinner at another steakhouse so I was hoping (maybe praying) for a better experience.\n\nLocated on the third floor in Harrah's, you first approch an exclusive double elevator in the Casino where a hostess confirms your reservation and summons an elevator for you.\n\nWhen you step off into the foyer, you can see that Harrah's has spared no expense to make sure the cutomer knows they are in a fine dining restaurant.  Beautiful woods and tile throughout and floor to cieling windows surround this restaurant which is in a half-circle overlooking the Strip.\n\nBehind the glass elevators is a lounge with a piano player.  At the second hostess station, I was greeted by name and escorted to my table which was windowside.\n\nI sat down, and seconds later my waiter introduced homself (Chas, prnounced Chaz), gave me the menu and specials, and took my drink order.  A bread basket was immediately delivered with butter in a cup which had been piped through a pastry bag unlike the night before where I recieved butter in gold foil in the other fine dining place.\n\nI ordered French Onion soup ($8), a Caesar Salad ($8), and a NY Strip Bone-In ($42) for my entree.\n\nThe soup was delivered hot and served in a huge cored-out onion.  I thought the soup was absoltely delicious and was actually a Cream of French Onion which was quite unique, but I thought the portion could have been bigger.\n\nThe Caesar Salad dressing was absolutely one of the best I have ever had and anchovies were delivered on the salad as ordered.\n\nThe steak was absolutely cooked perfect and was butter soft.\n\nHaving had three perfect courses with such great service, I decided to try one of their desserts.  I am not a sweets person, but I had 3 choices from 12 on the menu.  I chose the Tiramisu, Cheescake, and Creme Brulee.  I asked the waiter of my 3 choices, which he recommended.  He suggested the Creme Brulee which was my first choice, but it was served as a trio--Raspberry, Chocolate, and Vanilla.  I asked if I could just get the vanilla and was told that many customers had that request, and the chef prepares larger portions of just vanilla, although that option was not on the menu, but available.\n\nFrom that point on, I have to say that the Creme Brulee was THE BEST I have ever tasted from Paris, New Orleans, Montreal or anywhere!\n\nThe meal, restaurant, and service were so impeccable, that I did something I have never done in 25 years of travelling---I repeated the restaurant a second time the next night with a different menu!\n\nNow for the good news.  If you stop at any of the 11 Tix4Tonight locations in Las Vegas, you can buy a coupon for 50% off an Entree for The Range for $3.00.  So for 2, you spend $6.00 up front for a savings of about $45 for a couple.  Be sure to make reservations in advance--even on a weeknight, and be sure to ask for a window table."
"1","This is my first semester at UNLV and this review is mainly based on my experience with Bob Ain, a math professor at UNLV. \n\nI originally had Professor Choi as my math teacher but thought it was in my best interest to switch classes because there was a slight language barrier. I ended up switching into Bob Ain's college algebra class. During the second week of class he handed back an assignment and gave me an 8/10. After class I asked for an explanation and he said I should have written it in essay format. I then said you never specified the format and he said do your English teachers tell you the format they want it in. I said yes and he said that's bullshit and he told me to get out of his class multiple times. I could not believe the way he reacted to me and decided to speak with the associate math chair Malwane Ananda. He put blame on me for the altercation because I threw out the assignment on the way out of the classroom. This was completely irrelevant because this happened after he spoke to me in an unprofessional manner. After speaking with Malwane I felt like no one was on my side so I decided to let it go. \n\nWeeks later he disrespected me again in front of the entire class. He was writing a problem on the overhead projector and no one could see it so I told him and then he called me a \""smart ass\"". After this incident I could not let it go. I set up a meeting with the Associate Dean of Life Sciences Javier Rodriguez. I discussed my concerns with him at length and he seemed to take my experiences seriously but then never reached out to me weeks after we had spoken. He had told me he would call me or email me to confirm he had taken action even though he could not tell me exactly what type of action was taken. I decided to reach out to him and when he answered the phone he acted like he almost didn't remember me. I told him I was calling to see if action was taken and he said I told you I couldn't tell you. Then I told him what he said and he said he didn't say any of that. The fact that he couldn't even reach out to me showed his real lack of concern for the treatment I experienced. I will continue to fight this until I feel adequate action is taken. Bob is not only disrespectful and a terrible role model for students but his teaching methods are ineffective. \n\nIt is very unfortunate that the faculty that is supposed to stick up for students is doing the exact opposite."
"1","My 1 star rating is for after having driven all the way down to the bookstore from the outskirts of town and having had to pay for parking, I was not permitted to swap my brand new sweatshirt for one a size larger. I was told that I needed a receipt. The sweatshirt still has the price tag attached. All they needed to do was scan it into their system to see that it did indeed come from their inventory. For those of you making purchases, make sure you keep the receipt."
"1","Didn't understand I wanted the lunch special and not the lunch plate. Mostly vegetables in the Kungpow chicken. Place is run down. Large portions."
"2","Friend found this place for our yearly trip to Lake Mead.   We have rented from other local places and these guys are very nice and informal.  No long video to watch and we're not overly suspicious of us.  Skis were in good shape and ran well all weekend. They worked with us on return time.   Easy transaction.  I left $300 which I got back the same 3 hundred bills I left.   Chris and Joe are great and plan on using them on all our future trips."
"2","Well priced for large portions. The carne asada tacos and burritos are good. The staff is nice although usually they don't speak english. \n\nThe nachos are good too. :)"
"2","I have been going here for 3 years always a delight.. Food is fantastic full of flavor and very friendly. I would recommend this for anyone looking for good food. It is just a small family place.."
"1","On several occasion I have stopped at this location to refuel, and for the past five months every time I try and use my Chevron credit to save money, the automatic credit card for Chevron is unable to authorize purchase. Recently I drive an additional 2 miles on Durango and I have no problem at all using my Chevron credit card. \n\nUn doubly Terrible herbst has a scam going with all of there location.\n\nBEWARE"
"1","Don't join this service. And if you decide to use their \""One on One\"" training, think again. It ruined my financially. The contract is extremely one sided and literally destroyed me financially. Mike Ferry is the devil and doesn't really care about his clients. He would stab them all if he knew he could gain 1 penny from them. \n\nIt's a lie and a hoax. Don't drink the punch. You will end up losing. \n\nThat is why he makes you sign a 1year agreement. He just wants your money and doesn't care about your success."
"1","The company is a rouse!  Mike Ferry pays his sales staff a little above minimum wage...hourly.Some of these individuals have backgrounds like waitressing and internet gambling. Less than one percent are college educated!  Many clients request to get out of their coaching contracts because it DOES NOT WORK!!  It is a TOTALLY unprofessional business environment with male members of the call center sales team making BLATANT lude and sexual comments.\n\nAs a result, a formal complaint has been made with the EEO."
"1","All those people that claim Mike Ferry is hard ass about taking your money are right. He is old school flim flam man. Gets you to sign a contract and takes your blood. Stay away IMO."
"2","Until recently the last time I had been here was about 10 years ago. I recall that they have some really talented acts coming through and that the Thunderbird was the beacon of Butler Street. \n\nNow that Lawrencevile is seeing a revitalization (yay!!) it's good to see that the Thunderbird is still a fixture. \n\nWe visited for a post-family much needed nightcap in thanksgiving day. A few regulars were there but no bands performing. In all honesty I was surprised by the drink prices that are higher than some of my other favorites in the area. However, I would definitely return the next time I'm in the hood."
"2","Wow. Awesome food.counter service only wed-Fri. Super friendly staff. Great grocery selection."
"2","I first found Vince's on an emergency situation. Note to all readers don't let your inspection and emissions lapse near a cop. I called as soon as they opened and they had me in that very day. They were also more than accommodating in the fact that my paperwork wasn't all in order but since I was able to prove that insurance and registration were current they were able to finagle some magic within the system to get me cleared and through. The check itself was done quickly and thoroughly to boot. When I was told I needed an new part to pass the inspection (exterior mirror, damn hooligans with bats) they told me they would pass me if I paid parts and labor that day as the new mirror needed to be ordered. I completely understand this. If you are going to put your reputation and possibly your state license on the line you need a guarantee I am coming back. What really shocked me was the bill. Emissions, inspection, parts and labor all came to... a hair over $200. I almost felt like I was robbing THEM! When the part was in they called me to inform me promptly and when I was finally able to get my car in the fix was done before I could get back from the quick stop a block away for my daily caffeine fix. Customer service is top of the mark here. These guys do it right. The only thing that might put a visitor off is the fact that since these are hard working guys who work in a primarily open air/open door garage they do smoke. I don't mind because that is one of my own personal vices (sorry mom) but a non smoker might be put off. I say forget the second hand stuff and go anyway cause these guys are tops at providing great work and some of the best customer service I have ever had at a mechanics place. 5 stars all the way."
"2","You really cant beat frankies for fast cheap food.you can smell them cooking atleast 2 blocks away . a staple of butler street in my opinion. hot dogs ,sauage, meatball what ever you get its good. its a dive of a place... bar on one side food on the other with a small back room to eat 'and where the hell else in pittsburgh are you going to find pineapple pop?!?"
"2","Good Beer and Good Pirogies, what else could a connoisseur want? Having this all in an old church makes it that much better. Whenever I'm in da Burgh I make it a point to stop here. \n\nJust go there, you won't be disappointed."
"1","Its an Interesting location. The food was quite average. the service was good and friendly. They also had their own brew. I tried the sampler and I thought the stout sucked.\n\nIts an ok place."
"2","Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.\n\nWe started with the \""Nontraditional Pierogies\"" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.\n\nWe also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.\n\nFor an entree we had the \""Cinco Formaggio\"" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.\n\nWe also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!"
"2","I LOVE CHURCH! I heard a lot of good things about this brewery. Granted that I am not a beer drinker, i decided to check it out since the food critics on here made it seem good. I'm happy that I listened. The decor is kind of shocking because it is a church indeed w/ beer everywhere BUT once you try the food, all of that goes out the window. One word: AMAZING! Church is a place that is cool to hang out on a Weekend night w/ friends to just kick back & relax. I will definitely be a returning customer."
"2","Restaurant/brewery in an old church you say? I'm intrigued.\n\nChurch Brew Works gives you some really good food in a cool atmosphere. I'm not a drinker so I can't report on the brews. Had a pasta dish with shrimp. It was very good. I think all of us really liked our dishes except for maybe the couscous salad. Didn't try the pizza but some of those looked really good.\n\nWe had to wait about 30-45 minutes for a seat but in part because we didn't mind waiting and didn't feel like hovering in the half of the restaurant with open seating. They take reservations for groups of 8 or larger. Prices are a little on the higher end, but so is the food. Main dishes are in the 15-25 range but they are filling and taste great. Good, knowledgeable servers.\n\nMy only real complaint, the very poorly marked front entrance. FYI, it is the center door at the front of the church, which seems logical but when you are there, it is not easy to tell."
"1","The interior is gorgeous; a high-ceilinged church with the stained glass and mason work in tact. However, the hummus was just average and both of our side order of fries were SO salty that it honestly made our mouths wrinkly like when you swim in the ocean for an hour; disgusting.\n\nI had the pulled pork and it was dry, so either it was not slow cooked or it was slow cooked and sat as the juices evaporated around it.\n\nIt's a shame that such a cool building has such crappy food. Since it's a brewery I kept feeling like they should serve German delicacies but the menu is a hodge podge of pseudo pub food and not very good. A shame."
"2","Hit this place up on a weekend trip to PA. First off, let me explain that up until 1996, this place was a church and a beautiful one at that. Even though they brew their own been on the former alter, store their liquor in the old confessionals, and make their pizza pies where the old organ used to play, they kept all the stained glass, high ceilings, and rose window from this place. While I did feel somewhat sinful eating and drinking there, my experience here was excellent. \n\nWe had been drinking all day, so that did not stop there. Nice mix of homemade beers from pilsner to stout. GF ordered a french onion soup that was delicious. Table ordered a white pizza with chicken and spinach which was decent. Customer service was excellent here. I joked with the server that for working at a place like this, her penance would be that she had to carry around the extra heavy menus. She agreed on commented how it was tough with 10 toppers. The mgr, Phil, saw I was wearing a Chicago Bears shirt and start making fun of it with another employee. Of course, I started jawing back and forth with him. He came over to the table and was very friendly. He comped a round of drinks and I asked him where I could buy some of their pint glasses (see photo, glass says on the 8th day man created beer). He came back with 4 glasses for our table on the house. Saved me the trouble of having to steal them. haha. \n\nIf you can get past the place that this place used to be a church, you are in for a treat at this place. I would recommend it to all."
"2","For a place known for its beer, the food is shockingly amazing"
"2","I don't know about what some of these other reviewers have had to say, but we went on a weekend at 4:00pm, there was no wait for either the dining area or bar seating area. Our waiter was nice, I don't believe he ever mentioned his name. \n\nI have got to say that the beer selections was on point, the food was delicious. I had the Cinco Formaggio Pizza which was excellent, the wife had the Cubano Sandwich which was very good. \n\nWe will be back very soon!"
"2","this place.\n\nthis place is just..  well its just awesome.\n\nwent there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i'm sorry that i'm just now writing this review, because i can't remember the name of the bartender, but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible.  he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him, we will most definitely be going back.  I didnt eat any food, but the 2 people i were with got pizzas, and they seemed to enjoy them.  then of course, there's the beer.  now, i'm not a huge beer drinker, but if i was, this place would be my go to.  sure there are other great places to grab a local (or not-so-local) beer, but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church?  The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.  \n\nThis place is just a really great, different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food, and, if your lucky, arguably the best bartender in PGH."
"1","I pull up to the Unique Autowash and pay $21 dollars to get the car washed, towel dried ($2), and vacuumed ($6).   \n\nThe car runs through the autowash--it's nothing to write home about--and at the end, there are three teenagers drying and vacuuming.  Lackluster would be an overstatement.  One kid never took his eyes off his phone and texted the entire time.  The other two did a mediocre job vacuuming and barely dried the car.  There were streaks all over. Pathetic.\n\nI would have given the place two stars, but at that price point, it's verging on a rip-off.  Let me note that in both Chicago and San Diego, I got the same exact service for about $10 and they actually did a good job. \n\nMy car is still dirty.  Any recommendations out there?"
"2","Came in here three times during a week long trip because they are a devoted football (soccer) bar.  I was very excited to see multiple Spurs fans in attendance, although losing 4 to nil stung a bit.  \n\nOn a more serious note, this is a very good bar.   The only food I had was a delicious and gargantuan boxty that was easily sharable between fifteen people.  All three bartenders that served me were very cool, quick, and knowledgeable about the draft beers.  My only complaint was that they had no Power's whiskey."
"2","Stopped by while in Pittsburgh for work, and while many items on the menu caught my eye, I couldn't get past the lamb and roasted chestnut shepherd's pie. In retrospect, a huge plate of meat and potatoes wasn't the ideal meal to order on a sweltering summer evening, particularly since the dish comes straight off the broiler to you and is guaranteed to raise the temperature of your table 20 degrees. While I can't say that the chestnut flavor was strong, the entire dish was well seasoned, hearty, and completely delicious. And for under $10, it's a lot of food for your dollar. I also appreciated the beer selection and thought the atmosphere was cozy.  Great place!"
"2","Definitely my husband and I's favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. The food never disappoints and the staff is consisently amazing! Good beer selection and a cool atmosphere."
"1","This place is terrible.  It's a dive bar that stinks and it seems like a funeral home.  \n\nThe draft beer made me sick.  It tasted like they hadn't cleaned the lines in years.  \n\nMy friends like to drink and they all walked out without finishing their drinks.  \n\nAwful, close the place!!!\n\nThanks"
"1","Maybe it's a slow day...but we are here plus one other person. The guy sitting next to us had to ask for his sandwich to be microwaved...then when she brought it back he had no napkins and everyone was too busy on their cell phones in the kitchen for him to ask for a napkin. He literally had to reach in his pocket for a napkin. The cook did finally get us a beer...but waited on us with kitchen gloves on and handled our money. Not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes."
"1","No Way!!! Southside Tattoo has a terrible city-wide reputation and for a GOOD REASON. \n\n#1 - most of the artists are just so/so. \n#2 - they way over charge for work. \n\nHell, one time - a friend of mine and myself walked in to get some small, cheap, quick work done. Seriously, a 20 minute tattoo that we already with us. We talked to the guy at the desk, who was rude and said \""Let me talk to an artist\"" - the tattooist never came back out, we waited for 30 minutes, no one ever said another word to us, and we left. \n\nBack when I was really young and just started getting tattooed, I got my first 2 tattoos there - both scarred, were un-even, and had a TON of fallout. I ended up having to go elsewhere to get the one touched up because southside tattoo would not re-do the tattoo (poor professionalism for a tattoo artist) because of the high volume, 2 weeks later, the artist did not recognize me at all... and the other tattoo was so bad I had to get a full cover-up. \n\nThere are so many other good shops in the city - don't waste your money going to a flash-tattoo mill."
"1","Southside Tattoo has some really talented artists that churn out some great work. I am sympathetic to how busy the receptionist is, but every time I am in there, he is always rude and never particularly helpful or prompt.\n\nThe other day, my friend was hoping to get a tattoo walk-in, and Randy, the receptionist, told her she would have to make an appointment. We exited the shop, and my boyfriend was calling other tattoo parlors. He accidentally called Southside Tattoo, and Randy said they weren't busy. What? I don't understand."
"2","I LOVE MARIO'S! I visit Pittsburgh at least once a year and I make sure to visit this spot every time! \n\nThe staff are awesome and personable! Even when it's super busy, you can still get a drink in reasonable time! \n\nI like how there are levels that welcome smoking and other ones that do not. (I'm a non-smoker and appreciate this quality!) \n\nIt gets rowdy there, but that's part of the South Side fun!"
"1","\""This world needs a new plague\"" - Dwight K. Schrutte\n\n\nThat's how I felt after my last trip to Mario's. Perhaps it was because I was the only sober person on Carson Street at 1 am on Halloween but I have never been angrier at a bar ever. To start the doorman was an ass. I can't blame him all that much because I would be pissed too with the amount of \""21\"" year old asshats coming through the doors but at least TRY to maintain some professionalism. Same with the bartenders. Ok I get it you are busy. But you are going to make a grand tonight so suck it up cupcake. Also use you head. Don't spend so much time on the drunk sluts who order 10 drinks one at a time and don't tip. My biggest complaint however was the clientele. So many assholes that for the first time I honestly hoped a place would spontaneously combust with everyone inside just for the good of humanity. I wish I could say that this was unusual but this seems to be the same story song and dance every weekend at Mario's. \n\nYou may ask why this review is getting a 2 star. I must grudgingly say that Mario's does have some redeeming qualities, just earlier in the day. The decor is almost \""Cheers\""-like. Lots of wood and stained glass. The service, when the bar is about empty, has always been at least pleasant. The food is ok too. Nothing great; standard greasy bar food. \n\nAll in all this place is a passable bar prior to about 10 pm. Otherwise avoid Mario's like it was giving out free Ebola injections with every admittance."
"1","over rated, over priced and always crowded."
"1","I can't actually comment on the food.  The place looked nice relative to a lot of neighboring establishments and was recommended by our lunch-time server @ Nola (very good Creole) and our concierge.  My low rating comes from the fact that I called twice to make a reservation and no one answered.  After taking a cab from downtown we learned there was a private party and we wouldn't be able to take in the Jersey Shore fist pumping scene (thanks Callan W for the visual).  Simply disappointed in the lack of basic customer service.\n\nWe ended up down the street at the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  Not sushi but the gorgonzola filet melts in your mouth!!"
"1","5 people. No booze. $200. Was the food remarkable? No. Was it acceptable? Yes. Was it difficult to see in the low-light ambiance? Yes. Are there alternatives? Certainly. Do I think this place is a bit over rated? Sorta, kinda, yes."
"1","It's good. The rolls are better than the sashimi although one time we had some really nice(and surprising) maguro. We always get the hamachi jalape\u00f1o roll and some sashimi so don't get me wrong when I say the rolls are better than the sashimi. It's still enjoyable. Good atmosphere and my girl likes the martinis. Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.\n\n4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone"
"1","Don't go here if you are gluten free. Our server was pretty clueless and they couldn't prepare gf sushi. My food was cooked in the back, came out cold and I had half of what everyone else had. Had a reaction to my food. Def got glutened.\n\nAlso had to ask several times for water. My friend got the complete wrong sushi order. \n\nNot a great time at all."
"1","Ugh this place is so overrated! It's cool that they cook in front of you and everything but the quality of the food is not great!!! I've been here twice for friends birthday dinners and I don't know why they like it here so much. The service is awful and everything is so overpriced!!! If I never go here again I would be fine with it but I bet one of my girlfriends will drag me here again"
"1","Ive been a V.I.P. customer and frequent lover of Nakama for over 6 yrs now. I have spent a lot of $$ at this place. Ive always loved their service and food...Until now. My Finace and i were there for my Birthday dinner last night, i ordered my regular meal the way ive ordered it the past 6 yrs. The waitress informs me that i cant order my fried rice without the veggies anymore. I asked to speak with a Manager and a gentlemen named Chris comes to speak with us. (10 min later busy playing online poker) he saus he gets too many complaints from the Chefs that prepare the food about things like this?  I said arent the chefs paid to do what you tell them?  I even offered to pay addtional to have my meal the way i wanted it. I told Chris it was my Birthday and ive spent thousands of dollars here at his establishment.  He didnt care he said its a new rule although its NOT online and not posted anywhere on the menu. We ended up staying and eating my Birthday dinner the way Chris wanted it not me. But this is the last time we will ever be back. Waste of 2 hours driving waste of time ruined.my Birthday dinner. Bad customer service bad business ethics Mr. Chris."
"2","Pizza and wings were good, staff was very friendly. We didn't order any of the calzones but they looked really good, will try them next visit."
"1","I dread coming to this Starbucks. Have you ever walked into a place and felt totally uncomfortable? I get that feeling whenever I step into this Starbucks. Unless you walk here, forget finding a parking space. Carson street is very busy, and it's hard to park."
"2","Psssst! Hey you...have you heard about South Seas Thursdays at Tiki Lounge in the Southside yet? No?! Well, let me clue you in to one of the best kept secrets in the Tiki underground of the 'Burgh. \n\nLucky the Painproof Man...yes, THAT Lucky, the one who Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museums have determined to the the #1 sideshow act in the world...AND the lovely grass-skirted Greta concoct and create AUTHENTIC tiki drinks made with top shelf rums and many other of only the best-of-the-best liquors, housemade AUTHENTIC falernum, orgeat and other tiki syrups and liqueurs and fresh-squeezed juices. Nope, these aren't the overly sweet, garishly hued cocktails that you used to THINK were tiki, these exotic cocktails are made from the recipes of none other than Trader Vic and Beachbum Berry and from various classic 40's, 50's and 60's tiki bars that created the laid-back, liquid lifestyle that is tiki.\n\nOn a recent Thursday my cocktail of choice was Planter's Punch - and yes, it certainly packed one. A punch, that is. I've also enjoyed a Hurricane - nope, not the Hawaiian punch-colored (and, unfortunately, flavored, too) sort, but a REAL Hurricane made with fresh-squeezed juices; a lovely Mai Tai; a Lucky original with coconut, coffee, rums and I'm not sure what else - amazing; a Jet Pilot; Grog...and so, SO many others. \n\nWhether your choice of poison is a Sufferin' Bastard, a Zombie (enjoyed by many on Halloween, no less!),  Singapore Sling, or a Mai Tai...whether it comes in a tiki mug or a glass adorned with colorful paper umbrellas, cherries, wheels and wedges of citrus, fancy straws or even a tall, spiky pineapple leaf...whether you come with a group or all by your lonesome, you WILL enjoy the cocktails and the company of fellow tiki-philes.  \n\nMaking Thursday evenings even more special are the exotic sounds of DJ Dr. Zombo who sets the tiki mood with South Seas sounds and surf rock. Gotta love those marimbas and jungle bird calls! And if you're REALLY fortunate, you might hit on a night when Dr. Zombo breaks out the guitar and joins fellow musicians for surf rock sounds by Vertigo Go!\n\nYou can get tiki drinks at the Tiki Lounge any day of the week, but ONLY on Thursdays from 4-9 pm can you get the best of the best of tiki cocktails made by masters. Need a get away? This is it! Sigh...I only wish EVERY night was a South Seas night."
"1","Late at night and hungry, I discovered the Cambodian place down the street is a cash-only business. I chose this place because it was the only restaurant on the block with an open kitchen (many kitchens close at 10PM). Desperate times called for desperate measures, and I really should have taken the time to research a better restaurant.\n\nI ordered a seafood deluxe pasta dinner and chicken noodle soup. I was told it would take 10 minutes but it really took 30 minutes. I had planned on eating inside, but since it took so long, I asked for the meal to-go instead. By the time I got my food, I was pretty exasperated. The knot tying the bag was too tight, so I was unable to check the food; this meant I left without ensuring a fork was inside.\n\nThe food was very bad. I have no other way to put it. The pasta was completely tasteless. I know there was imitation crab in the pasta dish, but I can't decipher what else there was; I ate less than 10 bites. The soup was terrible, and I only had a few sips. The broth looked like Campbell's chicken noodle soup (except it looked like the same noodle as the pasta), but tasted saltier. The salad looked quite plain (seen better salads in an airport), but without a fork, I was unable to eat. The soup, salad, and pasta (with tip and tax) cost about $16, so I expect a decent meal at this price.\n\nI realize this is a pizza place and I should have ordered pizza, but I didn't want pizza. I also think if you're going to have a full menu, you should be able to properly present what's on the menu. I would've been better off ordering pasta from Pizza Hut. Attempting to eat pasta with a spoon didn't help either. Next time you're in the area, just skip this place."
"1","meh, decent venue.  the music is a wide range to accommodate all types of listeners.  the ventilation system, if there is one, is pretty bad.  it's gets very, very stuffy in there.  good thing there is a smoking ban but the smell sometimes gets a little rough since there is a lack of flowing air.  beer and drink selection is standard as are the mixing capabilities of the bartenders.  i've had better, i've had worse.  your drink wait time can vary from quick to AA meeting.  good thing the color changing bar is there to keep you occupied while your sobering up.  their sound system is great but their sound guy is less than the pittsburgh standard; as always, you get what you pay for.  gets a little crowded in there sometimes but lately, what place doesn't.  never had the door person or a bartender give me attitude; they're always very cool.  but that's where it ends as i've met everyone that's involved with the place.  overall i would say there are much better places to go on the south side."
"2","I passed by this place and just decided to try it. I tried their burger. Man..it was so good. Best bang for the buck. Especially if you're a student.. I had plenty of fries. Completely stuffed. =) Definitely coming back here again."
"1","I've only been here once and according to my friend, when he was here earlier in the year it was waaaaaaay better but I found the food very bland and warm, friendly service and cute atmosphere couldn't make up for it. \n\nWe tried the crab and artichoke dip and for dinner, inspired by Kitchen Confidential, I had one of their specials, a flounder filet with polenta. I'm usually expecting polenta to be this creamy, mushy puddle of heaven but here it was more like a quiche. So there was the flounder and a slice of polenta on their opposite sides of a plate, they didn't seem to go together. I wonder if it has anything to do with skipping out on the salsa that was supposed to go on top of the fish but I can't see how some chopped tomatoes would've made this any better. The dip was also plain and largely unmemorable. \n\nI did like the decor and the format, they have a smaller, quieter back room with just a few tables and a nice-looking, dark bar and more seating in the front. It's really romantic and I wish the food was tastier."
"1","My first review!\n\nI specifically asked the guy before they started if they would be able to mount 2 tires without scratching my nearly pristine wheels and they said, \""Yes, the machine doesn't touch the rim.\"" Obviously they were lying or took zero care when mounting the tires because there were multiple deep scratches around the edge of the rim once the tires were installed. Whenever I pointed it out to them, they denied that they put the scratches there, even though it was obvious the scratches were fresh.\n \nCall me a sucker, but I paid the $60 bill in full (cash), which I don't consider cheap, considering that all they did was mount 2 tires and dispose of 2 tires. I should have refused to pay anything given that they did a hell of a lot more than $60 in damage.\n \nI went to Duke's because it's 2 blocks from my house and I like to support local, small businesses, but I will absolutely, positively never go back there or recommend anyone go there. If you don't mind getting your wheels scratched when getting new tires, by all means, go to Duke's."
"2","TERRIFIC !!!!  My husband and I, along with our son and daughter-in-law, driving home from a trip to Cleveland, decided to stop in Pittsburg for lunch.  My son remembered seeing a place on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives that was to die for... so, we looked up the address and made a bee-line for Nadines.  TOTALLY worth the trip!!! Even better that we bargained for! The physical location was as described by previous reviewers and shown on DDD, not much to look at, small, etc... but WOW the food shines and the friendliness and service of the staff is FIRST RATE.  Each of us ordered something different so that we could sample each others fare.  We couldn't decide on what to vote the best dish because they were all DELICIOUS!  The burger was amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy and abundant, the Fried Bologna was killer, the grilled hot dog was incredible.  The Reuben was outstanding... Nadines perfectly sliced meat (razor thin) tasted so very good with the perfect amount of sauerkraut and dressing... can't say enough about it.  The Philly Steak was amazing along with the Fried Zucchini.  Guy Fieri was right on the mark with this one... OUTSTANDING and worth a visit.  Oh, and did I mention how incredibly reasonable the prices are... love it."
"2","I am pleasantly surprised; Who can beat $10 all you can eat buffet, with tasty food. I enjoyed it much. The coffee was weak, but the tea was awesome, the blueberry pancakes was not that great, but everything else was , I even enjoyed the desserts, I was pleasantly surprised for sure.  I read many of the reviews here and I am just floored at how unbelievable people are, this is a ten dollar brunch on a Sunday, what do you expect,  well I did not expect the food to be so good, but it was..."
"1","I don't go here often. Occasionally, I get a craving to go there, and am quickly reminded why. The crew is slow, surly, and rude. They frequently mess up my order, and the dining room is often an outright MESS!"
"1","This is the worst place you could possibly go to get food. Place is run by convicts who were placed here to have a job. You can tell they really don't care how fast they get your food out.\n\nThey are constantly out of Whoppers especially on SUNDAYS AT LUNCHTIME. Part of me thinks they just don't want to serve people. Whoever is in change of this place needs to be fired. They don't even clean the place."
"1","The service here on a Saturday morning was ridiculously slow.  We were seated and it then took 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our order.  Even then, the waitress only initially took our drinks orders until we summoned her back to take the food order as well.  Oddly enough, 15 minutes was just right to decide what we wanted.\n\nThe coffee kept coming reasonably regularly but the food took another 45 minutes to appear, which is just amazing.  It's diner food not gourmet a la carte.  The food wasn't bad though, although I would have liked my Corned Beef Hash to be a bit bigger.  It felt like someone was trying to dress it up as a fancy new style, when it should just have been served in the classic way.\n\nCan't really recommend this place but I can see the appeal of diner food 24 hours a day.  If only they can improve the service."
"1","tastiest food poisoning ever"
"1","Although the hotel was nice & very modern, it was definitely utilized by the 20-30 something crowd who wanted to party on Carson & have somewhere to crash close by. In addition, they charge $14/night to park & there was not enough parking spots for all the cars. They provide a hang tag, but when you can't find a parking spot & there are numerous (we counted at least 10) cars that do not have a hang tag, it is extremely frustrating! The bathroom was pretty dirty & the shelves had not been wiped down for quite some time, and the toilet had quite the ring as well. I will stay somewhere else when we come in the next time, preferably on the other side of Carson or possibly the North Side."
"1","Came to the Beehive for a bite and looking for a place to get some work done. \n\nFood: Okay selection of food. Mostly light meal oriented w/ panini and sandwiches. Lots of cakes and baklava.I got spinach pies- which are decent.Beehive roasts their own beans and coffee is pretty good.\n\nAtmosphere: ranges from eclectic to careless and haphazard. I wish  I hadn't come here to work. There are very few places set up for a single person and way too many mismatched, klunky chairs in this place. I almost never say something like \""I wish I had gone to Starbucks\"" but that's the lash back response I'm having to the overly quirky set up of this place.\n\nPrice: reasonable. I bought two spinach pies and a cup of coffee for $4.70.\n\nPayment Method: watch out! Cash only.\n\nOn the scale of one to ten (ten being way too much quirk) of coffee house chaotic-ness this place earns a 9. If you're ten years younger than me (I'm 27) you might get into it though. it seems like a reasonable place to go after you've bought some punk gear, had an underage-beer, and need to spend that last 5 bucks of your allowance."
"2","The Beehive is one of my favorite coffee houses in Pittsburgh.  Such a relief to come here - so unique and quirky compared to Char-bucks.  Great place to get work done.  Today I got a small house coffee (dark roast) and one of the best chocolate chip cookies that I have had in a long time.  Current renovations are going on - this place is huge with big mulitple rooms.  Pinball machines and board games and interesting lamps are scattered throughout the place.  Great music also.  Thanks for the buzz, Beehive."
"2","The Exchange has the biggest inventory of used CDs and movies in the city, so even if one location doesn't have what you're looking for, another location might. I bought a bunch of CDs here before I started downloading everything, and I still occasionally purchase a PS2 game or DVD here. The prices could stand to be a couple bucks cheaper, but otherwise it's all good."
"2","Love this little gem of a restaurant! Come here for the ambiance and enjoy a special dining experience. The food is excellent. BYOB places are the best. Just bring cash and an empty tummy. Take a look at the pics to imagine what you could be savoring! Yum!"
"2","This is definitely my go-to for best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It is always super high quality ingredients and great specials.  We went in on New Year's Eve which was a great idea with their BYOB policy.  We brought beer, wine and champagne and settled in for a fantastic meal. \n\nJ&B started with the infamous spinach dip.  Served with a whole loaf of their bread, it oozed gooiness.  J&I started with the special - lamb crepes.  Unbelieveable.  This should become a staple of the menu.  We also split a bowl of crab soup.  Spicy and filled with crab - delicious!  J had the scallops as his main course and was blown away by both the quality of the scallops as well as the extremely fresh veggies.  I had the salmon which is one of my favorites.  It's one of the few meals where you will feel completely full afterwards, but also very healthy.  J had the eggplant parm which is not normal eggplant parm, but is a much healthier, yet delicious alternative.  B had the steak which I believe is the best thing on the menu.  An awesome piece of meat covered with blue cheese butter.  Heaven.  \n\nWe ordered the chocolate flourless cake and the raspberry brown butter tort.  To say that these were good would be an understatement.  J&I ordered 3 desserts - 3.  We could have ordered more.  The raspberry tort was insane - buttery and sweet and mouth-watering.  \n\nGo!  Go now!   You won't be disappointed!\n\nOh, also cash only!  Be aware!"
"2","This place was just great. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable and the service was professional. \n\nAs already mentioned,  the food was just delicious - especially if you like mushrooms, lots of options for great mushroom dishes; wild mushroom consumme, mushroom and brie crostini, spinach salad  - add mushrooms,  a stuffed chicken with mushrooms entree...clearly, I'm a fan of mushrooms.\n\nBYOB - fabulous. Corkage fee was only two dollars a glass. I love a good BYOB, these restaurants aren't concerned with the profit of alcohol - they are in it to make really, really good food. That's awesome. \n\nThe space is small, probably only five or six tables - though in the summer I hear they have a gorgeous back patio - and there is an open kitchen. The service was...leisurely - due to the small kitchen. It was fine for our evening - girls night out with holiday grab bag gifts, a bottle of Prosecco (where we had asked them for champagne glasses which they washed and gave to us) and two bottles of wine. The place is made for dining, not for a quick dinner. \n\nCould have been a little cleaner , waitress could have been a little friendlier -  she was professional, but just a hint cold. Ultimately though, very satisfied. A must go for foodies in Pittsburgh.\n\nBe sure to make a reservation!"
"1","This place might be nice in the warmer weather but the restaurant was freezing and we had our coats on the whole meal. They also left the door open a crack to get the steam out from the kitchen. The service was slow the server was unpleasant and she didn't get us out on time for our show (which we mentioned several times including when we made our reservation). The food wasn't bad but a little overpriced."
"1","Overall this place is the definition of \""Just okay\"". The food is actually pretty cheap and on the whole is not that bad, toss in free popcorn and there are worse places to eat when you want bar food. The wings are my favorite thing to get but they are only good (I.e. Not dry and overcooked) about half of the time so it's a toss up whether or not you will enjoy them.\n\nThe real draw back is the service. The waitresses are uninterested at best and downright rude at worst. They always seem like it is an inconvenience that you are there. One time a waitress just stared at us with a scowl on her face from the other room because we had sat down at a table with a group of friends on a Saturday night (at like midnight) and so she couldn't leave as long as someone was sitting at a table. We weren't there to eat, the kitchen was closed, and we found out that she didn't have to stay at all after all so she was rude to us for no reason.\n\nThe service is bad, the food is okay, avoid if you can,"
"1","Out of business. For some reason, I have to write a whole paragraph about this. So, I will say that they are really, really, really, really, really out of business. Doors locked. Signs gone. Paint peeling off."
"1","This place screwed me on the on the check and refused to do anything to take care of it. I have never in my history of dining out been to a place that did that and didn't care about their customers."
"1","Good prices, nice decor, tasteless food.  I only ate here once, traveling from California.  Got the fresh spring rolls and Moarn Chha Kyei (vegetables in a \""spicy\"" ginger sauce).  The spring rolls were OK, but nothing to rave about.  The ginger dish was the blandest concoction I've ever had in a SE Asian restaurant.  I mean, there wasn't a hint of spice or heat, and there was only the faintest trace of ginger!\n\nI am hesitant to hazard a guess as to how a well reviewed Cambodian/Thai restaurant can serve such bland fare; maybe folks around Pittsburgh don't \""do\"" spice.  Maybe my palette has been spoiled in the Bay Area by real Thai cuisine.  Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this place based on the one meal I had there."
"1","Oh my ...dont like the food here. Tried the Pad thai and the chicken fried rice ...the pad thai was disgusting and the fried rice was not enticing either ...wont be going back ...ugh"
"1","Since I have family that lives down the street, I have been coming to Big Jim's for over 20 years. I used to really enjoy coming here but stopped visiting several years ago. Although the food was always good, the place was getting dirtier every time I was there.\n\nYesterday my wife and I decided to stop for lunch. I figured that the place was probably cleaned up since the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode. After being seated, I wanted to leave. To be honest, I don't know why I stayed. Nothing had changed. In fact I think it got worse.\n\nThe floor was filthy. There was food under tables that looked like it was there for days. Remember, I was here for lunch and they just opened. The tables and chairs in the dining room looked as though they were purchased at a yard sale. Very old and falling apart.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the service and food was good. I had an Italian hoagie and my wife had a salad. Both tasted good but I really couldn't enjoy it.\n\nI kept thinking that if the dining room was this dirty, what is the kitchen like?"
"1","Everything is kind of sub-par, except the pizza which might be good enough to be average. Eh."
"1","Went to p&g in millvale. A very popular and bustling breakfast spot. Ordered the blueberry crepes,. There's a picture posted on this page of these crepes and don't they look yummy? But what if you bit into yours and discovered the blueberries were frozen, and there was a layer of  permafrost over them? Would you tell your waitress, \""hey! My blueberries are frozen.\"" And what if your waitress said \""that's the way we serve them.\"" ? And if you said you really didn't want ice cold crepes on a frigid winter morning, but had instead looked forward to a hot breakfast, and she said there wasn't anything she could do because that's the way we serve them, would you write this review?  I understand Pamela is over on her new Squirrel Hill Deli's yelp page telling people if they don't like the food no charge, but I couldn't even get my crepes heated up at P&G."
"1","Dirty men's room.   Manager standing, eating in front of customers.   Unsure of who our server was.  Serving staff appeared and disappeared.  No one returned to fill coffee.    Pancakes were good, the rest of the food average.   Noisy.   Disappointing after so many strong reviews. There are better options."
"2","Jean-Marc's is definitely one of the best bakeries in Pittsburgh. I like to stop here after doing some record shopping. Their pastries are out of this world. The kouign aman and creme brulee are my favorites. The prices are great and the staff is very helpful. I've been to a couple of other French bakeries around the city and none of them compare."
"1","Not too impressed with them.  I had an arrangement made for my mom and it wasn't up to par with what I was paying for.  The flowers weren't very desirable looking.  If I'm shelling out money for pretty things, I want them to be pretty!\n\nPlus, the thing that really bugged me was that the shop REEKS of smoke!  Seriously, it's disgusting!  Who wants to come into a place that's supposed to be filled with things that are supposed to be beautiful and smell nice and \""rosy\"" and instead smell like an ash tray.  Very unprofessional in my opinion.  \n\nIt's too bad because they're the only flower shop on the Mount, so I'd they get a lot of business from the two funeral homes as well as business from the city.  Maybe that's why they stay in business, people don't actually step inside the shop.  It's just weird to me, right?!  \n\nI'll stick to the flower shop on Banksville Rd were the flowers actually smell good and the shop matches that!"
"2","This has the more classic Pittsburgh view than the Monongahela Incline, also has lots of pictures and memorabilia of Pittsburgh and how it's changed inside the building. For a small fee, you can see the inner workings of the machinery - this process of paying the additional amount feels like that of a sideshow at a carnival. \n\nWhich inclines view I prefer is hard to decide - Pittsburgh is beautiful from many standpoints. I might even prefer the views from the streets. This  experience, however, is worth its price of a bus ride. \n\nIt's a tourist attraction, the kind I bet most Pittsburghers haven't enjoyed. I'd check it out though, at least once."
"2","$10 round trip for two people might seem like a bit much, but the Duquesne Incline, wrapped in so much history and legend, receives no funds from any municipal body, so it relies on ticket sales and souvenirs to stay afloat.\n\nSo if it takes that from me to keep this thing going strong from 1877-now, then so be it.\n\nBUT, I almost knocked off a star for charging for parking. Sure, it's only $1, but it's $1 on an unmaintained dirt lot. It'd also be nice if credit cards were accepted for Incline tickets, but cash-only is sort of the nature of the beast with places like this. We're just lucky some folks with cash were kind enough to give us the few dollars we needed and have us Venmo them the amount on the spot. Thank heaven for Venmo.\n\nYou can't beat the view. The whole thing is touristy, but who cares, right?"
"1","We got turned away at the door because they only accept EXACT CASH for a ride...they literally won't even give you change...AND they give you attitude about it because how dare someone ask for change?  Even public buses will give you change but they won't. To top it off, when we were digging through our purses trying to find cash, an employee told us to move because we were in the way.\n\nAND we wasted money on non-refundable parking just to leave 2 minutes later. That's probably how they make their money because how do they make any when they turn customers away? \n\nAlso the only bathroom is a Mr. John port-a-potty. In the end we just drove up the hill ourselves....at least we saved those $15."
"1","I remember the Tin Angel of the 80s and 90s. There was a chef presence there at that time. Needless to say, its gone down hill ( no pun intended as it sits on Mt. Washington). \nWe went on a Saturday evening. Hardly anyone there but us and another party. The vast majority of tables empty. That should tell you something when the place used to be exceptionally busy.  First, unfriendly wait staff  should be replaced with eager enthusiastic servers. The wedding soup was the best tasting item on the menu.\nThe vegetable boat is something that is reminescent of an antipasta tray. It could use some sprucing up. The clam dip was ho hum and terribly runny. \nWe wanted veal but they were \""out\"" of it. Really? This is a city and you are a pricey restaurant with diners expecting a certain level of service on a saturday  evening. How can you not have access to veal. We were there at 6 pm and I saw no dinner rush so that would not explain it. So, we ordered Chicken and to say the least it was dissappointing. Desserts are glorified Costco cakes ( the chocolate one was a wad of Ganache). Truly this place is overpriced and obviously not on the radar of the foodie scene in Pittsburgh. My guess is that they have a few\nLine cooks back in the kitchen. Its sad because the intimate atmosphere could really be improved upon and the restaurant be very exclusive with a top notch chef. Its obvious the place will close its doors in the next few years without a major makeover from top to bottom.\nI hope they get their act together and improve the quality of their food. Until then, I will not be back."
"1","25 years ago, this may have been a great restaurant.  I don't think the menu has changed since then. That may have also been when they prepared the \""fresh\"" vegetable boat. While the view was great, it is one that can be found in any of the upscale restaurants on mt Washington.  Unfortunately, they couldn't seat us for the 7:00 reservations that we requested.  Oddly, we were the only ones there at 7:30.  Not a good sign on a Friday night..."
"1","FYI... Although Yelp says its good for kids, it is not. There is a sign on the door at the hostess stand that says no children under the age of 6 are allowed."
"1","I took my friend there for Sunday brunch today, and it was one of the worst brunches I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.   I felt badly that this is where I celebrated my friend's birthday."
"2","Another place my dad and I hit while staying in Pittsburgh in May of 2012.  Came here on recommendation of a couple people who worked at the Sheraton Station where my dad and I were staying.  \n\nEveryone we talked to at the hotel about this place recommended the Delmonico steak sandwich.  They all said basically the same thing.  \""It's what a Philly cheese steak  aspires to be\"".   I'm not sure if this is just a Pittsburgh v Philly rivalry thing.  None the less, it was a good sandwich.\n\nI also had the Gazpacho soup.  That was just what the doctor ordered.  \n\nWe sat out on the patio on a warm sunny evening and enjoyed a beer and sandwich.  \n\nAs with every place I went in Pittsburgh, the people were awesome."
"2","I have never eaten dinner here but their brunch is off the chain! it's $15 all you can eat and includes a breakfast beverage of your choice. I'd choose the frozen mimosa! The mac and cheese is sooooo cheesy and creamy! I love that you can also have bagel,lox,and cream cheese and they have onions,capers,eggs,and tomatoes to add to the breakfast sandwich. They also have the usual-bacon,eggs,sausage,eggs benedict,waffles. I love coming here for brunch!"
"1","Too expensive for what it is....but then it's on the mt so they bump prices up for the tourists. The fries are incredibly salty almost inedible.  Good for tourists not locals"
"1","Sad experience.  Spent 60.00 sending flowers to a guest reservation, restaurant manager and general manager both told me they bungled it and were very sorry but NO they don't really care much about helping me get a refund on flowers they lost.  Can't say this was a good experience or a good way to resolve a problem on their end."
"2","Been here a total of 3 times, all for different occasions. Have been satisfied every time. Probably the best Jumbo Lump crab cakes you can find in Pittsburgh. Freshest of fish, one time I got the Halibut with a mandarin orange finish and it tasted really fresh and very well done. Most recently, I ordered the Mahi Mahi with cranberry sauce and it was also very well prepared and tasted awesome. Every time I stop by, the service is impeccable, i'm always surprised at how much the wait staff have memorized for the every changing menu. I definitely recommend ordering some side dishes, you can't go wrong with a few Oysters on a half shell to start and then some Lobster Mac & Cheese to compliment your meal. Finally, they have a great Dessert menu, twice now i've gotten the White Chocolate Macadamia Mousse, honestly there isn't much better you can do to finish off a wonderful meal. Big enough to share with 2 or 3 too."
"1","The \""chicken\"" was soggy and a little rubbery.  The ice looked like it was icicles from the side of the building (It was winter when went).  The waiter was a friendly guy and very nice, although I'm not sure what is going on with the food...I've never been there since."
"2","This is the main branch for the Carnegie Library and it is needless to say, HUGE. \n\nThe place holds more books than you can imagine, and even if they don't have it, you can bet that one of the other branches have it. They'll request a copy of anything that your heart desires and it'll be sent right away. I requested a copy of Steven King's It and it came in around 2 days (don't judge my taste in movies). \n\nI love coming here to study, relax, browse, or even just to hang out with friends.  They don't have a great selection in movies but hey, I should just go read a book anyway."
"2","This library is great! There are rooms, and rooms filled with books, movies, and CDs! Plus any books that are available at other libraries not at the library can be requested and delivered to your local library. I actually don't read a lot but I still love this library. The only problem with this library is that is is hard to find stuff."
"1","Horrible customer service! The WORST i've experienced in a long time - in fact, I don't think I've EVER been treated with such disrespect. I asked a simple question about what the person ordered who was with me and the young ladies working glared and cut eyes at me - awful attitudes. My guess is the 2 girls working must be related to same because there is no way anyone with common business sense would hire such disrespectful workers with no clue about offering acceptable, good customer service."
"2","Spent first night here and room was very hot with even hotter air blowing from a/c. Opened windows only to find you need maint to close the window. Maid never cleaned the room the first day. \n\nI give it 5 stars because Samantha, the manager and Dan, the general manager were incredibly hospitable, more than any staff we've encountered. I travel over 1/2 the month and stay in countless hotel rooms. \n\nSamantha apologized immediately, comped our stay and Dan took me from room to room until we were satisfied. He then rectified the a/c problem for the entire hotel. \n\nOur daughter lives here and we will continue to stay at this hotel in the future. \n\nThank you Marriott, especially Samantha!!:)"
"1","Good specials.\nAverage food.\nPoor service.\nVery crowded even on a weekday in the summer time."
"2","Hems...\n\nWill always like this place because of so many great memories there.\n\nThey have pretty decent food and a good selection of beers for a college bar.  Prices are very good but can get extreamly crowded at night and on weekends."
"2","Love this memorial hall that commemorates the soldiers who fought in the various wars for this country. The Gettysburg Address is inscribed on the wall right about the stage and it adds to the Hall's nostalgic feel.  \n\nI love coming here every year for the Pittsburgh Bodybuilding championships. It's a cozy and intimate theater that's extremely comfortable to watch the stage from. \n\nOn an added note, this building was used to film one of the scenes from the movie, Silence of the Lambs"
"1","Joe Mama's is just lacking too many things.  There's a lack of atmosphere, lack of great food, and lack of great drinks.  The food is decent, but don't expect too much.  Overall, look elsewhere, there are better places very, very close by.\n\nThe food is Italian, but pretty uninspired.  Olive Garden is better, and I really don't like Olive Garden.  The drinks are pretty standard cocktails, but not particularly strong or reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is ...annoying?  I'm not sure why I dislike it so much, but I do.  I think it's just weird to have a dinerish theme but be italian food."
"1","1/2 price food - Yes.\nalcohol - yes\nitalian food - yes\n\nThat's all there is to say about this place. The food here is meh.... I've tried their pizza which is ok. I usually get the spaghetti and meatballs which is a half pound meat ball. And it's just 1 which pissed me off. You could at least put like 2 half pound meatballs on my plate. Seriously."
"1","I came here during oakland restaurant week and tried their spaghetti with their house salad for $5; the pasta was obviously cooked hours in advance making the texture pretty unappealing.  I could probably cook better pasta at home so I would skip their mainly pasta dishes (pretty sad for an Italian place). \n\nI've also been there for their half off appetizers at the bar, of which the bruschetta on foccacia bread was amazinggggly good.  however, it might have made me sick the following day, maybe they use their bruschetta mix for days at a time.  It was so good that I will give it another chance.  I also order their zucchini fries which came with ranch and were tasty except extremley oily and just drenched in grease.  \nThe bartender was extremely friendly and the service was ... funny to say but heartfelt which is always a plus at any place you go.  \n\nI've also on another visit tried their eggplant parmesan which was incredibly greasy as well, I was so disappointed in it.  \n\nI find that places in Pittsburgh can stay afloat and in business in this city whereas in New York they wouldn't have a fighting chance.  This is sadly one of them where the quality doesn't live up to the Italian Deluxe I hoped it would be :(.  \n\nIt is a great place to come with parents who are visiting for students, the interior decor is like an Italian diner, it is clean and nostalgic.  \n\nI wish I could give 2.5 stars.  their bruschetta is just that good."
"1","This was the second restaurant we checked out in the Oakland/Pittsburgh area. A university event was being held there so too many people in too small a place. But not to worry, no stars taken off for that since it wasn't the restaurant's issue.\n\nA buffet was set up with green salad, pasta with an alfredo suace, and another pasta dish with a marinara sauce.everything tasted like authentic, kitchen-made talian dishes (e.g. not out of a box or bottle, but ), so that was good. There was pizza too but I did not try it.The atmosphere wasn't great and I am not sure they had air conditioning which is brutal when it is hot and muggy out.\n\nI have no idea about the prices, and didn't even talk to a server...\n\nWould I go there on my own? Eh, maybe...just to give it another try in a different situation so I can experience it as a 'normal' customer."
"2","Joe Mamas is a great place to go for comfort, home cooked Italian. I typically get the same dish, which is the Almond crusted chicken which is very filling and reasonably priced for the amount of food given. Additionally, the service is always great"
"2","I love the channel, but if you ever get the chance to check out their office, it's really cute. I grew up in Latrobe (Mr. Roger's real neighborhood) and really appreciated that most of the space was dedicated to preserving his good name.\n\nIf you get a chance to have a meeting or tour there, take it!"
"2","Sunday lunch at Lulu's - after working in Oakland for two years and eating there only during weekdays at lunch, who knew that Lulu's actually has sit-down service during the daytime? I didn't, that's for sure, so I was surprised to see a bit of a line forming near the entrance at 1:30 on a Sunday.\n\nNo problem, as we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival.\n\nNow you don't go to Lulu's for good service. You don't go to Lulu's for the dining \""experience\"" that other restaurants offer. You probably don't go expecting an \""authentic\"" menu. You go for tasty food, served quickly and hot. \n\nSpicy basil noodles with chicken, on this visit, hit the spot just as they have on every other visit I've made. In fact, I love it so much that I hate to order anything else from the menu because I'm afraid to miss out on the vermicelli noodles steaming with carrots, snow peas, red and green peppers, etc. The sauce is sweet and salty, and could be spicier but I'm afraid to doctor up the plate with the red pepper sauce they have on each table for fear of ruining the dish.\n\nThe crowd is nice on a Sunday, relaxed but not lethargic. Our server was polite, took our orders quickly, and stopped once during our meal to make sure everything was ok. \n\nA word about takeout - I've only ordered it once from Lulu's and it was a remarkable disappointment. The food took forever to come out (30 minutes or so) and the balance of noodles to sauce to veggies and chicken was off because it was prepared in the to-go container rather than on a plate. I learned my lesson and now I'll only dine in."
"2","Lu Lu's has very affordable and very tasty food that always leaves me stuffed. The service is good, but parking is a pain. A nice bonus is that nearly all entr\u00e9es can be made vegetarian."
"2","I love the pan fried noodles with chicken. The sauce is delicious and just enough of the noodles are crispy. I think it's actually the only main dish I've ever ordered there because I love it so much. The service is consistently slow and I've been there a few times when they've mixed up orders. One time, I was there with as part of a party of 4. They gave my dish to another group, gave me the wrong dish and it took them like half an hour for them to get me my food. Meanwhile, the rest of my group was finishing up by the time I got mine. It was infuriating.\nFood - consistently awesome - 5 stars\nService - sooooo sllooooowwww - 1-2 stars"
"1","Yo! These noodles fuckin suck! Plate looked like homeless man vomit! Pass!"
"1","I detest this place. It used to be amazing! Brings back fond memories of coming here with my mom. I don't know what happened in the 11 years since I last ate here but it's gone downhill. \n\nThe first part is a  review of the take out we ordered. \n\nPad Thai was wayy too sweet and oily. \n\nSoups had a thick layer of oil. \n\nCurry was bland and flavorless. We ordered this takeout once and they put the rice under the curry. I've never had curry take out that served it this way. It's usually separate. \n\nMy mom never throws food out. This was a first for me to see her throw out three entrees right away. \n\nCame here after an exam to meet with friends. Deciding to give it one more shot. The chicken with veggie dish I ordered was actually ok. What made me mad was when I ordered hot water NOT TEA the woman behind the counter brought me tea with my meal. I politely told her oh I actually just wanted hot water she sternly said they don't offer  just hot water and made no attempt to take tea away. (It was already brewed in the cup when she brought it.)  we just looked at each other for a minute.  I took the tea and vowed  in my head  that due to the customer service and bad food I would never set foot in this establishment again."
"1","Our waiter is delusional! Bad service! He filled up my drink and forgot who it belonged to in less than a minute and gave my drink to the table next to mine! Food is bland! Never coming back! What a gimmick of a place!"
"1","They forgot my order, I waited 25 minutes for my bubble tea. The worst attitude I have ever experienced."
"1","I have many fond memories at Lulu's. It was my first off campus dining experience while I was at CMU. Food was plenty and affordable. Yesterday, I went back for the first time in more than 5 years. \n\nThe positives:\n- things haven't changed\n- affordable pricing\n- generous portions\n- fast service\n- variety\n\nThe negatives:\n- things haven't changed\n- variety (see more explanation below)\n- overly-Americanized \""Asian\"" food\n- bubble tea overly sweet and artificial\n\nI stick with what I know is decent:\n- Crab Rangoons\n- Beef Chow Fun\n- Pan Fried Noodles\n- Wonton Noodle Soup\n\nThis really isn't a place where you should try something new. If you decide to dine here, check out the reviews and pick which has the most votes."
"1","LuLu's is ok when I'm feeling hungry and don't have much time. I'm glad that they finally changed their bubble tea menu that now allows you to choose options such as the kind of tea, different boba and juices that are available. You can even choose how much or little sweetener that you want in your tea. The food is sub-par. I have found that Dr. Fu's noodles are my go to dish even though the past two times I've ordered there were only five small pieces of chicken throughout the entire dish. So, go and try it but proceed with caution knowing that there are far better options out there for you."
"1","I haven't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night.  Apparently this has turned into a smoking bar.  I find this odd since they also serve food (the kitchen hadn't closed yet) and I thought that was against the law.  This place reeks of cigarette and cigar smoke, so I will not be returning.  The service wasn't that great either."
"2","Yummy!! Definitely tasty for Pittsburgh. I've been to Cape Cod nearly every summer, and the ice cream here is similiar. It's also been ranked within the top 25 in the nation, right?"
"2","Oh Dave and Andy's. I'm not sure what I could say more than handmade waffle cones but I can try. Right when you walk in, you can already smell the fresh batter throughout the small store. That is, if you can even find a time frame where it's not always out the door. I think that's a clear sign of good ice cream yes?\n\nI've gone a couple of times but yesterday was definitely the best for me since they had carmel cookie marshmallow and it was just bliss. Marshmallow in every bite and it had a creamy texture that wasn't overbearing. I've had pretty good ice cream before in New York, but Dave and Andy's definitely takes the cake."
"2","Probably the best ice cream place I've been to. These guys have been hyped up by everybody, but it's all for good reason."
"2","Oh man oh man oh man how I missed this place! Best ice cream ever. Best waffle cone ever. I can never resist the smell of waffle cones whenever I come near this place.\n\nI'm not a fan of super sticky sweet stuff, like most American sweets. I grew up with more European style pastries and Asian sweets, and they are either not too sweet, or you consume very little bits of it. D&A's ice cream is in the first category -- it's creamy, fluffy, delicious, and not overly sweetened. It's definitely one of the best ice cream I've had.\n\nGuessing the color of and finding the M&M at the end of the waffle cone is always a joy too!"
"2","Get the waffle cone! The surprise at the end is a nice surprise!\nMany flavors to pick from and the employees are always nice.\nMissing a 5th star only because they do not take cards which can be a bummer! ATM on site but it charges a fee. :("
"1","I think this is one of those restaurants for those who don't know any better. However I don't think anyone could enjoy their Moussaka. Obviously it had been reheated in the back in a microwave, bec. it wasn't warmed evenly through out the dish. If someone told me that their food came out of a can, I wouldn't at all be surprised."
"2","Nice middle-eastern place near CMU.\nI usually get the 'Vegetarian Special' which is box with rice, hummus and baba ganoush (and bread). They also have awesome 'Sleek' which is this awesome concoction of kale, onions and beans.. tried it for the first time today and loved it.\nThe owner seems to really care about his food... always reminds me to hold box the right way when I get take-out.. seems like he really knows his middle-eastern food.\nAwesome place, but a bit on the pricier end, I could get a more diverse platter of food for cheaper at the middle-eastern truck at margaret morrison st."
"1","What food I got to taste was...not optimum. I came in at 1:15PM and the place was nearly empty. I hadn't eaten all day and was ravenous- also moved recently from NY Metro area and missed having a good gyro.  It took awhile to get noticed by the waitress- in an almost empty restaurant. I had a book so I read. I noticed 2 tables who'd come in after me being served- while I also noticed my waitress heading toward the front door not to reappear for 15 minutes. During that 15 minutes I imagined my lunch under a heat lamp.  When she finally came back, she went to the station. Finally she noticed me- and went back to the kitchen. \n   After maybe 5 or 10 minutes she came out. I took one bite. My gyro had big uneven slabs of meat- which were barely warm. Cold pita- a few crumbs of feta (I ordered it extra) and some runny sauce on the bottom- and big pieces of raw onion. \n  I really think she forgot to give my ticket to the kitchen- but even for the time she was in there- who gives cold pita on a gyro? Or can't slice the meat and cook it? \n When I told her it was cold- she took it back and told me they were making a new one. At this point it had been 35 minutes- and I really only had an hour and had to go so I told her to cancel the order.  She \""apologized\"" by blaming the kitchen.\n As I left- I offered to pay for my undrunk glass of milk- and told the owner about the service.  Instead of anything close to an apology- he told me no one else had ever complained about that before. TERRIBLE service and mediocre to bad food.\n   I went across the street and got some NY pizza which had a great crust and rivaled anything I've gotten in Manhattan."
"2","For the price the Tuesday buffet is great!"
"1","My partner and I just left and were disgusted by our experience. It's not often I harshly critique a restaurant, but this restaurant deserves to have its reputation tarnished. We walked in shortly after 5 PM on a Saturday evening and were initially greeted and shown to our booth. I have never before sampled Indian fare (and never will after this experience) so I was extremely excited to try it. I was prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash to have an all-out authentic Indian cuisine experience to try to cap off an early Valentine's Day date, yet we ended up paying $24 for two half-plates of terrible food. After sitting at our booth for ten minutes (the restaurant was NOT crowded) we just assumed it was buffet-styled only and went to each grab a plate. I had no idea what anything was and just tried to sample a small bit of everything. The food was barely warm, wasn't seasoned (isn't Indian food supposed to be spicy?), and there wasn't any naan, which my partner told me was tasty bread. \n\nAfter being grossed out by our food my partner asked if there was a way we could receive menus and order food from them instead. The server proceeded to ignore his inquiry. He discussed just leaving without paying in total disgust for the lack of service and awful food, but we promptly paid and left. For what it's worth we watched as another larger group walked in behind us and were approached at their table and asked if they wanted the buffet or to see a menu. I have half a mind to suspect we were treated so rudely due to our sexual orientation. \n\nIn seeing the reviews below if THIS is what you Pittsburghers consider to be great food then you obviously lack any sense of culinary expertise. I would love to thank India Garden for ruining my first foray into Indian cuisine along with our Valentine's Day."
"1","Just no. Let's start with the service. There are 5 to 6 employees milling about at any given time, yet none of them seem interested in helping anyone. (Aside from the water guy, that dude is on it.) None of the food came out at the same time for our party of 4, when it did it ranged from cold and congealed to lava-like and inedible. The food was mediocre at best. The spice ratings they offer you at the beginning are apparently just friendly conversation, as there was no spice to be found anywhere near the food. The lamb was chewy and I found a family of tiny bones in my chicken. On top of all that, we were overcharged by about 15 dollars. So, no, I don't think we will be back here. \n\nBut man, that water guy sure was great. 2 stars for water guy."
"1","It's hard to like this place after Taj Mahal--but there were many choices and it wasn't the worst, but it really wasn't the best. Some stuff was over salted and the chicken tikka was dry."
"2","This place brings great memories to me :) Its a cute bar/restaurant place,and i guess its mostly filled with CMU kids and maybe Upitt.They have a good list of beers and i am a great fan of their food.\n   Wait for it....The world's best fried called the \""Waffle fries\"".It's just soo tatsy and out of the world.everything time i think of good food ,i still wonder if there is a place which makes waffle fries.This is the place where i first ate waffle fries and i am going back for that..pssst..i even wanted to make a trip to Pittsburgh just to eat them ;).And the last thing i wanted to do before leaving pittsburgh was...any guesses??\n   Yes!!!eat waffle fries :)They are great!!but not healthy apparently.It's a great place to go hangout with a bunch of friends,and relax.Don't miss it !\n\n-Smriti"
"2","If you live anywhere in Pittsburgh and want a decent cheap meal and good beer selection do yourself a favor and head over to fuel. It's the perfect image of a 'hole in the wall' for Oakland, so it does draw the younger college students, and the seating is usually pretty tight, if you don't mind that you'll be greatly rewarded."
"1","DO NOT GO THERE. I lost 6 inches of my hair because of this place!! I went there for the first time and had my hair done with Tee. I asked for an ombre with darker roots (my hair is dark brown) and I already had highlights on. I spent 4 hours there and my hair came out ORANGE with red roots! I looked absolutely awful and it wasn't anything close to what I asked for. I went back an hour later and asked them to fix my hair. Spent more 4 hours at the salon and left looking even worse. My hair started to fall out while I was at the salon and they did absolutely nothing! I left there with my hair falling out and looking absolutely terrible. They literally cooked my hair, and I lost 6 inches of it! I went to a different place on the next day and all the hairstylists were terrified with what happened to my hair and said they had never seen worse job in their lives. It was all damaged and the color was so ugly. I had 6 inches of my hair cut off and I used to have really long, pretty hair. Now my hair is half of its old length because of Mark and Anthony Salon. Not only that, but when I called they said it would cost $60, I ended up paying $150! I asked for a refund and they gave it to me right away, but they can never give me my hair back or all the money I had to spend at the new salon and with all the products I have to use it now to fix what they did. It's going to take about an year for my hair to grow out and not to be damaged anymore. I've never regretted something as much as going to that place. By any means, do not go there if you care about your hair. Don't make the same mistake I did."
"2","Visited Pittsburgh for a wedding and needed to get a haircut away from my regular guy in NYC.\n\nI read the reviews from searching on Enrico's so I decided to give it a try, being very timid at first since I was worried about not get my ideal haircut.\n\nEnrico was extremely professional and very knowledgeable about what I wanted. A few simple directions and he went to work right away. \n\nAfter an extremely detailed but fast haircut later I was extremely happy with my result. Its seems like its a one man shop and makes perfect sense since he is too experienced, good of a barber to be working for someone else. I highly recommend giving him a try, he just might become your \""guy\"".\n\nNotes:\nHaircut was $15 and cash only. He had the TV with the History Channel which made background viewing, but he was very amiable as well."
"2","Enrico is a great place for a quality cut. He is busy, and the phone does ring, but in all the many times I've been there he books the guy, hangs up and moves on. Seriously, it's a good hair cut, he listens to what you want, and delivers for a fair price."
"1","A bit of a run down hotel in a location convenient to CMU. Everything is clean and functional, but really doesn't stray far from functional.\n\nIt also has a few oddities. The bathrooms have full-length mirrors that face the toilet. The net connection is slow enough that it's not great for doing business (e.g., VPN). My wireless modem is as fast or faster. Service was kind of perfunctory and cool. Not a bad thing, but not something to recommend either.\n\nRooms are large. Beds tend toward the soft end of the spectrum."
"1","I love Papa John's but just not at this location.\n\nLike the others have said, the \""crust\"" is too fluffy and not crispy. I normally look forward to dipping the crust in the garlic sauce, but didn't bother this time. So very disappointed with this place."
"1","Great sausage   Wonderful spicy rich flavor obviously made with feeling.  That almost made me go to two stars or??? But my family was just so disappointed overall that I'm sticking with one star. \n\nAmbiance:  kitchy Italian knick knack filled dining room which is a little over the top but fun.  No problems\n\nService was terribly.  So slow. We arrived before 9 and it was 9:50 before anyone took our order and then only because we flagged down someone. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen in this half filled not busy restaurant.  \n\nMeal comes with salad.  Could be yummy but we can't say since ours never came. \n\nEntrees included that yummy sausage but also cold dense ricotta noodles   Other yelps raved over this dish so huh??? Maybe the chef was asleep or we were getting the final dregs of the day.  Unclear. \n\nGot the bill.  They charged us for blue cheese on the salads we never got.  Huh again?   Didn't correct the bill but offered us free tiaramusu which also NEVER came. Huh. \n\nWe called and complained and the owner seemed nice and apologetic but stilll....\n\nOne star."
"1","I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I should have waited a bit longer I suppose.  The experience I had was not stellar at all.\n\nI opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  I should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.\n\nFrom the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.\n\nOne other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion."
"1","I order from this location at least once a week. I've never had any problems with my orders but maybe that is because I order in the early afternoon and the location doesn't have such a ghetto staff working! Anyways I order the same things ever time so I know how my food should look and taste. For this order I ordered a meat lovers pizza. When I get the order as soon as I opened the box I knew it wasn't correct. A meat lovers should have ham, pepperoni, beef, italian sausage and bacon on it. It had 3 out of 5, on top of that I asked for extra sauce on the side and didn't get that either. So I called (The order was wrong and I had every right to. When you order and PAY for food to be made you expect it to be correct). The manager I spoke to, MIKE, was dismissive from the start. When i told him the pizza was missing topping like bacon, he then said the meat lover's pizza doesn't even come with bacon on it unless it is asked for (As I am looking at the website because it as up from me placing the order and on top of that I order it all the time. So he LIED and for no reason! Then he offered a credit. I thought that would be fine but then I began to eat the pizza... It was gooey and had a weird taste. Then when i peeled back the toppings it was RAW! Disgusting! I called back and again he didn't want to take responsibility for the employee who made or should I say rushed my pizza because at one point he was saying they were in a rush to leave (I placed my order at 9:35 so it wasn't like I ordered before closing) Then he said in a rude voice I can come pick up anther pizza. If I wanted to come there and could get there I wouldn't have had it delivered. And the guy was so ghetto I would not have trusted him to not do something nasty to my food. MIKE didn't speak with any type of professionalism for me to trust he would be professional enough to make me a new one. They should have a class on empathy and how to properly deal with complaints, and some training on how to follow directions when making a pizza!!! I usually wouldn't even bother to complain but I've work in the food service industry and there is no reason to treat anyone rudely or have a bad attitude. So thanks MIKE (If thats your name) the manager for ruining my appetite and night!"
"1","I just had the worst pizza I've ever tasted from this place.  Many other reviewers seem to concentrate on how good the service is.  The service is good, they delivered my pizza within 25 minutes, but I can't imagine how they could have done a worse job making it.  The chicken tasted like it was irresponsibly old.  I'm glad other people thought it was good but I will not be going back.  Me and a roommate got a pizza planning to split it.  We got about 1/3 of the way through, couldn't finish, and now he is laying on the couch with a sick stomach and I am dissatisfied enough to write my first review of any business.  My other roommate asked me to throw the remaining 2/3 of the pizza in the outside trashcan because it smelled so horrible. I would've given it zero stars if that was possible."
"2","I had a Groupon, saw the less than 3 star rating but decided to form my own opinion. I loved the food and the service was good."
"1","Service complaint. I have had this pizza before and it is the best value pizza around. However tonight I placed a pick up order and to my surprise the employee said he forgot to make my order. No sorry. No discount. I have worked in a family Italian restaurant before and this would not be tolerated. To screw up an order that bad and cause me to wait another 20 minutes without making it right is ridiculous. Time of order was 730 on a Monday."
"1","On my way home from work, I always walk by this place and I always see people walking into here.  So I decided to give it a shot and see what's up.  I'm not a health freak or a food guru nor am I picky about food but this place is just plain bad.  The $5/meal is pretty decent until they charge you an extra $2 for lo mein instead of rice.  But the biggest thing that bothers me is the huge puddle of oil that the food sits in.  Again, I'm not a health freak but eatting this food just made me feel guilty.  With every bite, I think about getting a heart attack at 27.  There's as much oil as there sauce and you see the thick oil floating above. don't expect a fantastic dining area either.  it's dark and feels icky.  \n\nI've had my fair share of cheap chinese food, and this is probably the worst I've tried."
"1","Not worth it..."
"2","Really quick, cheap and delicious! I got a tofu and rice dish. Large portion, not greasy and very delicious!"
"1","NOTE: A duplicate of a review of this place under a different name.  Just noticed that this place is listed under two different spellings: Grand Canal Cafe and Gran Canal Caffe...\n\nAt first glance, it's a charming little \""neighborhood\"" Italian restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Simple decor, even a bit cheesy but in a lovable way.  It's comfy.  It's friendly.  You feel quite welcome when you arrive.  It's like dining with friends or extended family members.  \n\nOnce inside, though, we were deflated by the decor.  There are NO windows, and an odd configuration to the two claustrophobic rooms.  The chairs aren't terribly comfortable and there are NO tablecloths.   \n\nBut I didn't let any of that bother me because I had heard the food was terrific.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers to share: cured beef and scallops. Both were delicious.  We ordered the cannelloni and veal piccata.   The cannelloni was good, but nothing special.  The veal dish was average.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment -- and a clue that attention to detail is NOT a specialty -- was the rotten lettuce in the salad.  Not one or two pieces of lettuce, but a good half-dozen in each salad were beyond wilted -- soft and brown.  \n\nWe had gelato for dessert.  It was disappointing.  \n\nThe service was reasonably attentive but ineffective.  We had to ask for water CONSTANTLY!!!!   And, after the first round of drinks before dinner, we were never asked if we'd have liked more.  \n\nOkay, but hey, it's a neighborhood restaurant, right?  Casual, family dining, right?   WAIT!  $110 for dinner for two at a \""neighborhood\"" place?  For THAT kind of tab, I would have liked tablecloths, better service and a more even quality to the food.  \n\nWe might go back, but I'm not sure..."
"1","You'd think a sloppy klutz like myself (my friends use the sweet euphemism that I'm \""good at making things looked lived in\"") would be a regular at the dry cleaners. You'd also think I wouldn't buy a light-colored winter jacket, because that would probably mean lots of stains, right? That's what you would think, right?\n\nBut no. And of course I ended up with a giant black stain on my coat. Ink? Oil? Tar? Pomegranate juice? Who knows, but I was way too scared to tackle it myself, which led me to my first experience with the dry cleaner. \n\nThe dry cleaner terrified me because my friends have plenty of horror stories about things coming back with holes or with stains not being removed, and I had no idea what the price of anything was or even how pricing was determined. I envisioned someone handing me back my clothes and saying, \""We charged you $45 for this summer dress because it's hideous.\"" \n\nMy jacket was $30 (usually only $23, but it's down and there was that mystery stain). They were able to remove the stain and a pen mark by the sleeve, but one on the front proved too stubborn. When you take something to the cleaner, you know, you want it completely clean, especially if it's $30. I mean, the point of having a professional clean my clothes is hoping they'll be able to get rid of the incriminating messiness I can't.\n\nMy button up shirt was $4 for a wash and light starch. It was categorized as a blouse, even though it's exactly the same as a men's dress shirt, which are $3.50: this detail annoyed me. \n\nMy striped jacket with a stain on the front (did I mention I'm clumsy?) was $10. They weren't able to remove it but said they'd try again for free. If they get it out I'll give them another star, but I have my doubts.\n\nAccording to their brochure they're the \""Pittsburgh area's most respected & trusted pick-up and delivery service!\"" I should have realized a slogan that says nothing about your quality of work says everything about your clientele's priorities. The people who use Four Seasons regularly don't have the time to pick up and drop off their own dry cleaning, which works for them, but since I'm not a high-powered executive (or on house arrest), I don't mind doing it myself.\n\nConsidering my clothes weren't totally clean, and how many cleaners there are on Squirrel Hill alone-not to mention the rest of the city-I've got a hunch there's a better deal for me somewhere in the city. I'm on the hunt!"
"1","DH dropped off some pants for dry cleaning.  When we got them back one pant wasn't even cleaned.  For the price this isn't something you can overlook.  When we brought it to their attention they fixed it promptly, but were unapologetic about it.  Plus we had to wait another 4-5 days.  I won't be back"
"1","Fool me thrice, well, that's my fault but I've finally learned my lesson. \n\nIssue #1: I take a suit in to be dry cleaned because it smelled a little like a smoky bar and had some fur on it. I have a week's leeway before I need it. I go to get it when I'm told it will be ready and I'm told there's a delay because of excessive \""stainage\"". Well, since there weren't any stains, I ask for a manager. At this point, the woman behind the counter says she needs to call me back. When she does call back, they admit to not knowing where it is. Eek! Ultimately they find it at whatever place they outsource it to and I was able to get it back later that day. Not a disaster, but should hav ebeen a red flag.\n\nIssue #2: a pair of jeans that I have hemmed end up 4\"" too short. Well, I was pissed, but I didn't try them on for the tailor to measure and he just measured based on what I was wearing right then because I was in a hurry. I guess I thought that maybe it was possible that they could stretch in a different way or, I don't know, something. I took the blame for it and didn't make an issue.\n\nThe final issue: I paid for a pair of expensive pants to be hemmed and put a rush on them so they would be done by Thursday. I called on Thursday and they told me they'd be done on Saturday. Annoying, but nothing I could do. So, on Saturday I go in and the woman working says they can't find them... AGAIN. I wait for about 30 minutes while she makes a series of calls, to no avail, and then tells me she'll call me when they find them. Towards the end of the day they find them and I go to pick them up. They actually had the nerve to charge me. You'd think if you'd screwed a customer over this way, you might give them a freebie to make up for it. Not this place. When I said I'd never be back, the woman said \""we all make mistakes sometimes.\"" To which, I replied, \""Not all of us make them as often as this place\""."
"2","Kevin's solutions are straightforward, resourceful and often surprisingly inexpensive. He gave me a simple suggestion today for a laptop problem, and it worked. I know with Kevin that his aim is to offer his customers what they need .... whether that be a $5 used mouse or a new computer. My computer and my wallet are in good hands at Kevin's Computer and Photo."
"1","Rose Tea Cafe has truly gone down the tubes since the days I was in college, when it first opened. I remember the hype of \""the first GOOD bubble tea place in Pittsburgh\"" and it really did live up to being just that. Then I would come here and get my fix of beef noodle soup, rice with braised pork, rice with pork chops, sausage fried rice, etc. and leave pretty happy. \n\nBut no longer. I came here this past week (nov 2008) and was very much disappointed. Perhaps if I came without the expectation of it being pretty good, I might have given this place 3 stars. But, the let down is not forgivable and I fear that I will opt never to come back here again. And to think, I used to rave about this place to other people?!! The food was excessively oily, with no distinguishable flavors except salt and soy sauce. The service was pretty pathetic too. Besides the employees, I think I only saw one other table of Chinese people out of a pretty full restaurant. That should've tipped me off in the first place!\n\nSo, please do NOT call this place authentic Taiwanese food. Ugh, the good ratings for this place kind of makes me wanna puke."
"2","Boba (aka Bubble Tea (aka Tapioca)) is fantastic here.\n\nBack in California, we have a boba chain called Tea Station and Ten Ren's.  Theirs is the best I've ever tasted and Rose Tea Cafe is comparable.  \n\nTheir Green Milk Tea (or jasmine milk tea in other places) was the perfect hint of tea.  The consistency was not too thin or thick.  Their actual tapioca balls... I don't recall whether they were exceptional but they weren't bad.  \n\nThe food is pretty good and comes in healthy portions.\n\nNow, the BAD...  the wait is absolutely ridiculous.  If you come around dinnertime- 6p or 7p, you really have to wait an hour for two people.  It's also a very narrow room so the waitresses are constantly tripping around people waiting by the door.\n\nI just advise that you come around 8 or 9p or a lot earlier in the day."
"1","If you want to try something here, try the short rib with peppers.  It is one of their best dish.  However, if you come here be prepared for shitty customer service.  \n\nIt took a while for us to get any service.  From ordering to asking for a box.  The waiter took his sweet time to take our orders even after us catching his attention.  Another employee came out to serve another table and saw I needed service but still didn't say anything to anyone else.  Why the hate?  I'm Asian too.  Aren't we suppose to stick together or something?\n\nI wouldn't recommend their drinks.  They mainly use powder and artificial BS.  I tried their red bean milkshake and it came out blasting an hour later.\n\nThe family that owns this place owns several restaurant around the area.  The other places seems like a joy except for when you come here and the life drains out of you.\n\nTry at your own risk."
"1","I've been going to this giant eagle since i was a kid. there's no excuse for the company not to improve the parking and ease of navigation of this location given what i can only imagine is its tremendous profitability. in fact, the only reason it is so profitable is due to its great location and the neighborhood. the store is dirty, cramped and can't compete with other giant eagles, the strip, whole foods, trader joe's etc. for variety and freshness. the employees are totally useless, as is the manager who works nights. avoid."
"1","I grew up in Squirrel Hill and have been going to the Squirrel Hill Flower Shop for the 20 years I lived there and then phoning in orders for the ten years since I left. I felt loyal to them since they're a local business in my neighborhood. But they are so consistently unpleasant when I phone, and seem disinterested in my business and reluctant to help me to select flowers. For example, this morning when I phoned:\n\nme: I'd like to send flowers to my mother.\nthem: we're only doing open (\""open-something\"" - I can't remember the term).\nme: what is that?\nthem: designer choice\nme: what is that?\nthem: the florist puts stuff together\nme: can you describe anything more about the \""stuff\""?\nthem: no, we can't tell you the type of flowers or colors.\nme: well, it's hard to spend money on something when you know nothing about it. can I get it without the vase.\nthem: yes. it's $50 plus $10 deliver.\nme: and without the vase?\nthem: it's still $50.\n\nSo I declined and found, through Yelp, Alex's flowers on Craig Street, where the owner was very charming and descriptive about the flowers and what he could put together, and very reassuring that the bouquet would be beautiful."
"1","Very unprofessional and rude !!!The quality of their tailoring service is poor to say the least, they will quote you a price and when you pick up your merchandise they demand a higher price than what was originally agreed to..."
"2","Aladdin's is just a solid restaurant. The menu is extensive, it's quick, the wait staff is friendly, and I am never disappointed with my meal. They use very fresh, high quality ingredients. Their baba ganouj and falafel are some of the best I've tried! The falafel is perfectly crispy and fresh, not overdone. I often go here for takeout because they are so quick and reliable. If I do takeout I usually get a rolled pita with hummus or baba and tabouli. My parents love this place as well. My only slight complaint is that sometimes it is a little cold with the AC, but I just have to remember to take a sweater and then I'm fine. The outside seating is also very nice on a summer day!"
"1","I usually love Aladdin's but today it was unbelievably awful. I will go back again and hope things have changed. \nFor starters they charged me twice for tea (4.50) b/c they gave me a second tea bag. Had I known that it would cost me an additional 2.25 for a single bag of cheap tea I would not have ordered it. The least the waitress could have done is have told me that my \""free refill\"" was not, in fact, free. \nAlso, the tuna in the grilled tuna salad was disgustingly fishy and overcooked. I usually order something different (the mishwi or lamb salad) so I am unsure if this is how it usually is but also the fact that no one seemed willing to fix the issue makes it far worse. \n\nI told the waitress that she should have told me about the extra charges and her answer was that I was correct about her having to tell me but that she didn't and basically that sucks for me. No answer on the fish. \n\nI have been a long time customer and am sorely irritated that I was treated this way."
"2","This is a nice Starbucks location: friendly baristas, and it's big enough to sit and stay for a while on the cushy chairs. Only drawback of this location is the limited parking."
"2","Why am I reviewing a beer warehouse?  Because in Pennsylvania your life will depend on these few and far between places to purchase alcohol.\n\nIn all my time visiting relatives in PA I never realized that in regards to alcohol it's like visiting a foreign country.  I used to think Norway was annoying but PA takes to a whole other level.\n\nLet me see if I have the rules right.\n\n1) You can't buy alcohol and places you normally can, like the grocery store, corner store, etc.  You have to go go special stores that sell just alcohol (all you scandis should be familiar with this concept).\n\n2) Beer and Wine/Hard Liquor are sold separately in different stores not even close to each other.\n\n3) You can only buy beer in cases from the beer store.\n\n4) You can buy 6-packs at any bar.  I'm not sure what the price rules are for buying from the bar.\n\nSo in my time in Pittsburgh I was only able to visit this beer warehouse (hey, it takes a while to work through a case of beer).  Not sure if this is usually the case but the selection here was awesome.  If this is what it means to have special beer stores, then I'm all for them, except I would like them on top of and not instead of the normal grocery store/liquor stores.  Beers from all over the country and all over the world.  And not just cheap weird stuff you've never heard of but good brands.\n\nPrices weren't the best but I'm assuming there's little you can do when the state sets up a monopoly like this."
"2","This store has been in Pittsburgh for many years now and the people that work here are great.  They have a great game selection, with lots of Euro-type strategy games and puzzles.  The staff are all very knowledgeable and will give you helpful recommendations.  \n\nThey have a fun borrowing program, where you can borrow games for $5.  \nIf you return the game within a week, the $5 becomes store credit.\n\nThey often have demos out where you can try some new board games briefly.  And, they have a trade-in shelf for exchanging games with other people.  It's great they have a store like this  in Pittsburgh!"
"1","When they first opened, the food was good, but then it went downhill.\nTheir food is not fresh and every dish is socking with bad oil. \nNot authentic at all since I am from Szechuan, I know how my hometown food taste like. I can cook much better Szechuan dish at home  . Disappointed...."
"2","\""The New\"" How Lee is a great example of just how much the food scene in Pittsburgh has developed and grown over the past decade. Not so long ago, How Lee's was a down-and-dirty corner joint turning out strictly mediocre Americanized Chinese fare for take-out only. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has been transformed into a sit-down restaurant serving exhilaratingly spicy and flavorful Sichuan dishes.\n\nWith two dining partners, I sampled the dan dan noodles, the garlic eggplant, and the Sichuan prawns. The noodles were pleasantly chewy and luxuriously bathed in the sesame-rich sauce studded with bits of ground pork. The eggplant had a tinge of sweetness nicely countered by the sharp garlic and swirls of chili oil. The prawns were dry-fried with several cups of dried chilis. The fresh sweetness of the shrimp balanced perfectly with the saltiness and spice of its seasonings.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt, and our server checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased with our meal and to see if we needed anything further.\n\nThe New How Lee is a wonderful addition to the Squirrel Hill food scene and I'd be more than happy to dine there again."
"2","Came here one Friday night when the wait for Everyday Noodles was too long. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by this comforting and familiar smell of a LEGIT Chinese restaurant. I didn't think there would be any in Pittsburgh so this was a nice surprise. I don't usually like Sichuan food but this place was pretty good :) and really go for the authentic stuff. If you are just gonna order the generic stuff why even come here?"
"1","I've read many positive reviews of Chaya that I almost wonder if I went to the same restaurant (I did)\n\nWe went on a Tuesday night, the service was fine, we weren't rushed...but there also weren't any parties waiting to be seated.\n\nThe positives - one of the best ginger dressings I've had. The sides of sticky rice that came with my dining companions entrees were very good. The roll sushi was good (cali roll, sunrise mix roll), but not unlike any other roll I've had. The portions are large, if that matters to you. The fried chicken that comes with the meal is decent, but nothing special.\n\nThe negatives (which far outweighed the positives on this occasion) The miso soup was incredibly fishy in the bad way, they use a fish broth that tastes like it's been sitting around or something. \n\nThree of my dining companions ordered the tempura (2 chicken, 1 veggie)  The dishes are very bland, no seasoning whatsoever. The texture itself is enjoyable, but you must rely on the accompanying teryaki sauce to get any flavor whatsoever. One guy in our party got the beef teryaki which looked good, and he confirmed this, but I did not try it.\n\nProbably the most dissapointing part of my meal was the part I was expecting to be the best - the nigiri pieces. I ordered uni (sea urchin) ika (squid) fluke fin, anago, and toro. \n\nI'm not really an uni fan, but this didn't appear to be fresh. Fluke fin is a muscle, so one would expect it to be tough at most sushi places but I was hoping for better from chaya (as an aside, umi managed to make it incredibly delicate) the squid was tougher than I would have liked. The anago was fine, but nothing special. Worst of all - the toro was a bit tough. To my understanding toro should never be tough.\n\nI'm hoping I just caught them on an off night. I do plan to give chaya a second chance as so many rave reviews make me hope that they truly can provide a great meal. I wanted to give Chaya a rave review, but my first experience was way less than stellar."
"2","My favorite affordable sushi place in the city.  I love the people that work there (they are very friendly) and their new storefront (2032 Murray; just one block up the hill from their old location) is bigger and in better shape, making the atmosphere very pleasant.  I believe it is owned and run by a Japanese family, which is a rarity in Pittsburgh and results in high quality sushi.  I have been coming here for years and even though I've had a couple of not amazing meals for the most part everything has been everything I hoped.  Sushi is my comfort food and Chaya is the place I go for it."
"1","I've had sushi boat here with one of my friend. The fish was not fresh at all and I feel like I've got ripped off! I don't think I am ever going back here again. I am a raw fish/sashimi person. I don't usually eat cooked/warm Japanese. Maybe their rice ball or warm dish are better. However, the only good thing I liked at this restaurant is their WASABI! I have to admit I loved it! \n\nIs it just impossible to find fresh sashimi in Pittsburgh?"
"1","My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed. \n\nWe started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received. \n\nMisoshiru was very under-salted. \n\nMy unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.\n\nMy fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.\n\nWhy does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back. \n\nWe've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places. \n\nDisappointed. :(\n\nGood points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service."
"2","This isn't \""the best ______ I ever had\"" kind of a restaurant but your solid, go-to delivery/take out/dine-in solution. If you live in squirrel hill, this is your neighboorhood chinese place, period. If you are having a bad day, you should get the spare ribs, shrimp with broccoli, maybe some lo mein. It's the kind of place that's easy to take for granted because it's not in fact extraordinary or unique- until you find yourself looking for a well-priced chinese delivery place that is better than okay, that is actually very good. \n\nThey aren't easy to come by. I've moved around quite a bit over the years- new york state, pittsburgh, italy, florida, and now los angeles. Best food? italy. Best chinese delivery? Definitely new dumpling house. And not just delivery, it's actually a very comfy place to eat and close to all your squi-hi destinations.\n\nI get cravings sometimes, especially for the vegan orange chicken-- and I'm not a vegan. I'm not even a vegetarian, I just shared it with a vegan friend once and was hooked. It's just like a really good orange chicken but kinda creamy in the middle and without any funny little cartiledge bits. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......."
"1","Worst dumplings I've had in my life. The skin is so thick, and the filings fall out like a rock.  I can make playdough dumplings that taste better than this."
"1","This place is horrible! Ginger duck was gross and other dishes were bland. I will never be returning here."
"1","Very Americanized; haven't tried the sushi, but why would you eat sushi at a Chinese restaurant?"
"2","My review is based on the service, not the food (just haven't tried enough yet to know how it is - usually stick with sushi). When you first sit down you have an appetizer, sometimes something different, with a whole pot of tea. Included. When I went with a friend who wasn't ordering, they still treated her like a guest and paying customer bringing her tea, oranges, fortune cookie, etc. The servers are kind and attentive. I had the combo sushi rolls and was surprised to get soup and a salad as part of the meal. I thought I was only paging for the sushi. I had the whole dinner for $16. (3 sushi rolls, salad, soup, tea, appetizer, oranges, fortune cookie)."
"2","Amazing hotcakes/pancakes.\n\nThe line moves quickly for such a small place.\n\nThe homefries are also great.\n\nI will miss this place - I wish they had a location in California."
"2","When you're in Pittsburgh, you choose between Aiello's or Mineo's. Most people choose Aiello's, and it's not hard to understand why. The za doesn't LOOK great, as compared to others in Pittsburgh, but it TASTES most excellent. The sauce is somewhat sweet and somewhat spicy, the cheese is decadently salty. The crust is a bit dry, but not horrible. I could eat this pizza for the rest of my life and never be sad. (In the end, I choose Mineo's over Aiello's, but Aiello's is an A+ pizza.)"
"2","I don't know about you, but this is my favorite pizza place in all of Pittsburgh! Can't go wrong with Aiello's. It's small and cozy, but it's exactly what I'd expect from a pizza place on Sq. Hill. Late college night? Try this pizza. It is amazing, it is delicious, and I wish I could go here more often."
"2","I love pizza. More than I should admit. Moving from a small town to Pittsburgh widened my options. I've made it a goal to try as many different pies this city has to offer. No need to read further. Just go. Now. \n\nAiello's is my go to everytime. I crave it. Nothing has yet to compare. Start with a crispy but not to crusty underbelly and a mild chewy but not to soft center. Baked to perfection. The sauce it the epitome of Italian spice profiles. Not sweet from added sugar like you so often find but a natural hint of the sweetness from the tomatoes. The cheese. Oh the cheese! \n\nGo to Aiello's. Right now. The price is worth every mouthwatering bite. Why are you still reading this? Go."
"2","I love this place. Sometimes the pad thai is hit or miss though, hence why only 4 stars.\n\nI love the lunch specials: soup, salad, egg roll, and dish for $8.25? Perfect deal. Soup is wonderful, as is the egg roll! I don't eat salad but I'm sure it's great too!"
"2","I love this place.  I used to live in Squirrel Hill.  I first started going there as a bar patron, then quickly realized how great the food is.  Their buffalo chicken dip is awesome!  Its pretty great food for a reasonable price.  The bartenders are great too!"
"2","The prices on the menu outside almost scared me off, but they were just dinner specials. I ended up getting the canons burg burger, being a fan of buffalo sauce and bleu cheese. It was the best bleu cheese burger I've had in my life. And the fries- they give you so many fries, you have to dig out your burger from under them. All for a price of about $11. I was very impressed, will recommend to friends, and plan to come back."
"1","Read rave reviews for the burger, so we tried it. Just ok, could have more flavor. Sweet potato fries were limp and soggy too. The wait was also really long, but it's more because it's a small restaurant I think. \n\nI guess it's sort of the only burger joint in Squirrel Hill, but I think i'd go somewhere else instead."
"2","Three Iconic pizza places in the same block.  Napoli's is hands down the best.  The other two beat any chain hands down, but Napoli's is tops.  We had about 15 people over the to the house and had a blind taste test.  Locals, a couple of southerns, some Swedes, a Venezuelan.  Napoli's pepperoni beat the other two hands down.  Better than most NYC joints and ALL Chicago pizzerias."
"1","Two things Mineo's taught me:\n1) There is such thing as too much cheese.\n2) Some pizza slices really do need to be blotted.  Normally, I roll my eyes when people blot their pizza--what's pizza without some grease?--but Mineo's slices are an exception. \n\nThe sauce here is pretty good, but as is the case with the cheese, there's too much of it.  I've burned my finger holding down the cheese as I bite into my slice so I don't end up pulling off all of it.  I thought the crust leaned towards being a little too crispy.\n\nI like the paneled walls and the framed photos--check out the Life magazine cover of young Molly Ringwald.  But I don't come to a pizza place for ambiance, so it's not enough to keep me from looking at other places for a superior slice."
"1","Way too greasy for my taste. I like some grease on my pizza but not to the point where the pizza box is falling apart because it is drenched in grease, yuck! The cheese they use isn't so tasty either. I'm all about the cheese and it was so bad I ended up taking it off. That's no way to eat a pizza! Next time I will try Aiello's."
"1","What happened to the Mineos I remember? The sauce tasted SOUR and the crust like cardboard. I'm so very disappointed because this used to be my #1 pizza place."
"2","What an awesome neighborhood joint. As an out of towner I was lucky to get taken here! No frills food, drinks and company. Great jukebox with a wide selection and lovely waitresses that don't ask if you want another drink...they ask if you want another pitcher. \n\nIt's set on the main strip in the neighborhood and has a great feel. Even my first time here I felt super comfortable, nice dive bar feel without being super...divey.\n\nMake sure and tag the chalkboard in the womens bathroom, much more civilized than a sharpie!"
"1","Be prepared for second hand smoke"
"1","I wanted to give this place a better review. The Cafe was pleasantly full, great tunes, and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately we (a table of 2) waited 45 min for our food to never come out while seeing a table of 5, who came in 20 min after us, get served first. The waitress was apologetic but her continued \""your food is coming out next\"" assurance lost credibility when she had to repeat it twice and then servered the table of 5 was first."
"2","Love this bar! Fun crowd and the staff are all incredibly nice. Drinks are affordable and the food is VERY cheap. I had a burger and it was quite tasty."
"2","I love to support local baristas over the corporate coffee shops. 61c is a great place to grab a cup of coffee or some delightful loose leaf tea. I do agree that the interior can be crowded, and that the majority of the patrons are typically affixed to their laptop screens.\n\nI give 61c props for outdoor seating (in the spring/summer), delicious homemade granola, and the best blueberry cheesecake that you've ever had. The blueberry variety is made in-house, and is incredibly substantial (I am a total whore for cheesecake). Remember, 61c is cash only!"
"1","Uncle Sam's has really gone down hill. \nThe staff has gone from polite, to indifferent, to borderline hostile. Simple requests are ignored - when the error is pointed out - they become indignant.  Turning to the food... the sandwiches are now 90% lettuce and served cold.  If the old adage about judging a kitchen by the state of the bathroom is to believed - stay away."
"2","YUM! I got a pepper steak Philly cheese steak and my boyfriend got the steak and mushroom. Both were so great and moist, but at times was a little lacking in flavor. The meat could have been spiced more (more salted, even), but they make up for it with the crunchy yet chewy bread and delicious fries. \n\nThey have this great mysterious spice that you can throw onto your fries and your sandwich -- it's in an orange container with the salt. I have no idea what it is but it is ridiculously yummy and makes your fries finger lickin' good!"
"2","I love Gullifty's!!! Its a really excellent place to get some dinner or dessert with your friends before a night out or just to spend some time catching up. \n\nFriday and Saturday nights can have a little bit of a wait, so be prepared for that. The desserts are way better than some of the reviewers here give them credit for and they have a really excellent wide variety to choose from. \n\nPrivate lot in the back as well as street park all require coins for the meter (pain!) but, when i'm back in pittsburgh about once a year, a stop to gullifty's is always on my to-do list!"
"1","I had heard about Gullifty's even before I moved to Pittsburgh.  It has the reputation of a charming neighborhood spot with very good desserts.  Many claim their desserts are the best in Pittsburgh.  My recent visit there was not  memorable, not particularly bad but nothing to write home about (sorry ma.). I give them props for making their own desserts in house but despite the large selection, too many options seem like something you could get at Eat n Park or Applebee's in a slightly more commercialized  form.  Oreo, peanut butter, brownies on top- Don't get me wrong- this sounds decadent but it's date night, not my post-toke meal at Dairy Queen.  With that said, the desserts we had were pretty tasty.  Not best of Pittsburgh tasty, however.  I would have liked some more creative options.  The savory options were basically your usual diner entrees but the variety and flavor were both decent.  The service was average, friendly but untrained.  As for the decor, they need a facelift badly.  It looks like 1985 in there and not in a pleasingly retro sort of way.  There is a small but adequate selection of microbrews which is certainly a positive.  I think if I come back to Gullifty's any time soon, it would probably be for a late night slice of pie or coffee.  Otherwise,it's a pretty run of the mill establishment."
"2","best egg rolls in the city."
"2","Pleasantly surprised! Great food and service. My only complaint is the same as other people have said, the wonton soup. The broth is good however, the wonton's are not stuffed with anything so it's basically broth with wonton skins. \nEverything else was great! Highly recommend if you are in the area."
"1","We finally tried the talked about Brunch at the Grand Concourse. Going in with high expectations, we left very underwhelmed. Not only are the food stations scattered around the dining room, but the food options themselves are lacking. \n\nThe 'hot station' has what I would call your typical breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.). There's a carving station with prime-rib, ham and turkey - the high point of the meal.\n\nSalad option were mushy, and the Bananas Foster was a quickly thrown together imitation, though the donut station was unique.\n\nMy made-to-order Bloody Mary was good, though.\n\n3 cocktails and two brunches for $75 -- I was expecting much, much more."
"1","I chose this hotel because it's where I always stayed as a kid with my family. Too bad nothing has changed since. The hotel is outdated, the furniture is banged up and even the doors themselves could use a serious coat of paint. We had to have an engineer come up and replace two light bulbs upon walking into our room. For what I'm paying I would have expected something better than motel 6. You can hear EVERYTHING outside of your room so if you're a light sleeper forget about it. Not worth it for the location."
"1","2.5 Stars!\n\nSnuck out from work this morning to get a good second cup of coffee.  Remember folks, a caffeinated supervisor is a happy supervisor and thus she's kind to her minions!\n\nBagels here are so-so, but Bruegger's has decent coffee."
"2","two words: pepperoni rolls. \n\ni love you milano's"
"1","I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry."
"2","Great diner food! I recommend the hanlons handful for breakfast! Great price and right amount of food."
"1","The staff, barring the afternoon clerk on the day we checked in, were uninterested in anything other than getting the job out of the way so they could get on with their personal conversations. Food, on Thanksgiving, not well priced and very dry..everything was very dry. The heat in the hotel itself was on full blast (it was about 50 outside) and when trying to regulate the heat in our room, it was impossible to get relief from the stifling heat even with the window open. The television didn't work, and we couldn't rent movies because, as the maintenance man said \""oh this hasn't worked all week\"". Thanks so much. When we checked at at midnight because it was so miserable, no one asked why we were leaving. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this hotel. Oh, and the woman in the gift shop? She followed me around asking \""are you going to buy THAT?\"", etc. Completely insane and ruined my entire Thanksgiving. When the manager called to follow up on my having filled out the survey, he was defensive, angry and unwilling to offer anything to assuage my disappointment. Complete waste of money and time to go to this hotel."
"2","Gorgeous during the holidays. There is a massive Christmas tree in the lobby and tons of decor to match. This seems like a really old building but is extremely well kept. The staff are super friendly as most everyone is Pittsburgh seemed. I wish I could have stayed here a little longer but this was a stop on my way to new work. \n\nA solid 6 hour drive to NY,NY from here. Worth staying at."
"1","I lived in Negley Court apartments. The good was that it was relatively economical. The bad: the place was quite dirty, the garage run down (water leaks and filth) and overall the place in pretty bad repair. \n\nThis is all stuff you can put up with. What was amazingly unpleasant and very unprofessional was the property manager (Mary Blocher). I found her to be generally lazy, rude and highly uncooperative. In the end it was even impossible to get her to do a handover when I moved out (there was nobody there to take the keys). Ultimately I had to contact her manager to get the deposit back. He claimed that she'd been put on a different job, alas, as I can see, she's still working there. Easily the worst property manager I ever had the misfortune of interacting with.\n\nAnd yes, I did not want to post this review while I was still renting for fear of retaliation."
"2","I ve been living here for a year and have faced no problems at all. The apartments on the penthouse floor which is the 22nd floor are great. You have an option of choosing an apt with new appliances which are much better than the really old ones. The maintainence staff and the office are always available and helpful. I did have some problems with the dishwasher and the kitchen sink but it was fixed."
"2","Came back, and I'd write the exact same review all over again.\n\nNow pass me the potato gnocchi, please. And as for Tony P's issue, sorry Tony - but go marry yourself that British chic and bring her back here for some good Gnocchi and Chianti! I'll buy if you do!"
"1","Cluttered and messy.  Cold food. Undercooked pasta. Not enough food ( if you order family style) and poor beer selection. The bartender had one other person at the bar, and we tried to order a pitcher of sangria and for 5 minutes he never addressed us. \n\nOur regular server was nice, but that didn't make up for the rest of it.  It's the food that matters most but this is where they fell short."
"1","You'll have to forgive me. I live in Los Angeles where there is valet parking for hamburgers and top chefs have food trucks that can be found here, there and everywhere. A burger with a side of fries smothered in Duck Confit with White Truffle Sauce - so perhaps the bar is a tad higher than here in - ack - Pittsburgh where I found myself searching for sustenance before attending the wedding that brought me here. I only hope the godawful mess I actually ate doesn't rear it's ugly head mid-ceremony.\n\nIt sounded like such a novel concept, a sandwich with all the sides just piled on. After all, it's all going to the same place, right? Having been born and raised in Chicago it was a familiar concept. The noble Chicago Dog, a study in contradictions: sweet and sour, spicy and mild, hot and cold - a veritable melange that blends and tantalizes from the first bite to the last. Yes! I'll try it!\n\nWith my omnivore brother and his lovely wife I made my way through the chilly streets of downtown Pittsburgh on this frosty Saturday. A bustling little metropolis, scant parking so (I am shamed to admit) I pulled in a nearby lot that charged an $8 flt fee. A small price to pay, I reasoned, for a gastronomic delight as has been described here. Yes, as I said, I'm from out of town.\n\nOn to the main event - my bro and his bride went with the signature piece, the pastrami sandwich. I opted for the Hot Sausage with cheese. May god have mercy on my gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIt is a wonder how a sandwich with so many things can be so uniformly bland. Perhaps it starts with the niggardly portions of actual meat - when confronted with this sandwich in profile it is hard to find under the wad of soggy fries and tasteless cole slaw. The liquid in the slaw makes the bread begin to disintegrate almost immediately so that should you be as foolhardy as I and actually attempt to eat this mess it will be all over the table in short order.\n\nI ate it - I admit that. I'm not proud of it, but I was that hungry. The saving grace of the near-complete lack of any discernable seasoning is that I don't have an aftertaste to suffer through, but the leaden ball in the pit of my stomach promises to make up for that with a trip or two to the bathroom in the hopefully not too distant future.\n\nI would eat at McDonalds before I went back here. Please - don't fall for the raves here. It's pure, unadulterated crap."
"1","Nestled in a little cranny of duquesne university, this little Subway is here to provide food to hungry college students. It is a Subway, though, so we're not talking gourmet. Normally, a conventional subway experience would garner three stars, but this one failed me on this visit in three capacities: 1) a broken oven, so no toasted sub and 2) no provolone cheese. These are only mild irritants, to be sure, but the third I found somewhat irksome. The sandwich seemed very light on the meat. Makes me think the restaurant is skimping to save, but I could be wrong. That said, the dining area is clean and well maintained, and the staff friendly."
"2","i have such a fine time here whenever visiting good ol' pittsburgh.\n\nthe best/funniest was back in '02, when visiting friend todd, and meeting his roomate. said roomate got so sozzled he actually pooped himself, then passed out. when he awoke, covered in crap, he simply wanted to know why anybody would put all that poop all over him...\n\nyeah. good times."
"1","good: it's cheap, loud, every now and then a good band will play, good drink selection.\n\nbad: the parking and the crowd.\n\nit's fun to watch the young kids marvel in this new bar they've just discovered and is totally the coolest place, like, ever.  funny stuff."
"1","Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?"
"1","Waste of time, jumping into the Ohio river with your mouth open in search of your own catch like a Pelican would have been a better option. This place is nothing but another chain with mediocre food and spoiled college kids working tables. \n\nThe crab was over cooked, the fried fish was soggy and deep brown. It was 6pm when do they change their oil? For the overall quality you are given the value is 2x what you should be paying. It's on par with Red Lobster, the only difference is they shove everything in a pale. My 4 yr old like that...If I was that Pelican I would have flown away if I knew better.  That was the first and last time for us at Joes. \n\n\nScore\nFood Quality 2\nService 2\nAtmosphere 4 ( it's Pittsburgh how can you score bad!)\nValue 1 \nRecommend 1"
"1","Horrible place.  This bar/restaurant could be so much more, but the surly employees and their laissez-faire (for you Ryan's employees reading this, that means 'I couldn't give a damn') attitude just seals the deal:  I'll never set foot in this place again.\n\nAdd to their attitude, and the mediocre food, the fact that their \""patio,\"" where all the windows were closed tonight, was filthy with smoke.  When I questioned the self-designated queen behind the bar about this, she asked why I was \""so angry.\""  Well, that comment practically lead my mouse to the Allegheny County Smoking Violation Report website, needless to say.\n\nIt's a shame that a place such as this still exists; clearly it draws from beyond the actual Regent Square neighborhood, where tastes are obviously not so discriminating."
"1","As far as Wendy's go, it's middle of the pack. They get the order wrong by at least a little bit 1/3 of the time. And calling it \""fast\"" food is kind of comical. But, if you're in Wilkinsburg...well, this place is in Wilkinsburg also. That's about the best I can say. Oh, and everyone is generally polite here. So they've got that going for them."
"1","Was never a big fan of this place but my kids enjoy it. I called today to place an order and of course was placed on hold immediately then when someone came to the phone I ordered a special #5 which was on a menu I had. Well she starts to repeat my order back to me and that's not what the menu had. She goes oh I just counted down 5 specials well that doesn't match my menu. I then read to her what my menu says. She proceeds to tell me that my menu must be very, very, very, very old cause she's been there for 4 months. My whole issue is this was obvious when she began to take my order but instead of telling me that she makes up her own thing after she promised me she can get me the number 5 special. Well guess what they longer have it so how can you make that promise. I ask to speak to someone else. I'm assuming the owner comes to the phone with her rude self. The sad part is they only treat customers that way because of where they are located. But its not a problem because my mom ordered from them every Friday for my kids but we won't be back. Rude customer service is unnecessary."
"2","I love this pizza. If you like sweet sauce then you need to try this pizza."
"1","DON'T. Just DON'T. I am so disappointed in Michael's. Maybe at one time, the food was palatable,  but that is no longer the case. I just want to save anyone else from wasting their time, money and appetite.  Like many other reviewers, I noticed how empty the place was, it was no coincidence. An empty restaurant on a Saturday evening is a huge sign. I hate to give it 1 star, because it truly should be zero. I can't think of anything positive to say which is shamful."
"2","Good Stuff!  Everything on the menu is pretty good.  They usually have a few decent beers on tap too!  The place gets busy, though, so be prepared to wait."
"1","I've been here twice.  It was like visiting two completely different restaurants.\n\nThe first time my girlfriend and I tried this place on a Friday night about a month ago, we loved it.  It's a small place, clean and inviting, with a neighborhood-hangout kind of vibe.  We'd heard the wings were good, and we weren't disappointed; the garlic Parmesan wings were a knockout.  We also had a Yinzer sandwich (very good), cheese sticks (also a winner), and some beer -- big damn $3 Yeunglings.  And to top it off, as we were leaving, the owner ran out to stop us -- we left such a large tip that he thought we'd forgotten money.\n\nGreat food, cheap beer, attentive service -- what was not to love?  We were DEFINITELY coming back.\n\nWell, tonight we came back.  Whoops.\n\nThey were short-staffed; the bartender and the cook were the only people working.  But they weren't that busy -- about ten or so people in the bar, with two in the dining room when we sat down and four more seated about fifteen minutes after us.  The bartender came over to get us drinks, and assured us the cook would be right out to take our orders.\n\nThe cook didn't get the memo.  After waiting a good twenty minutes, we flagged down the bartender as he was getting the newcomers' drinks.  When he saw we hadn't been tended to yet, he graciously took our order -- another Yinzer sandwich, some cheese sticks, and some more of those delicious garlic parm wings.\n\nAnd then came the waiting.  And the waiting.  And the waiting.\n\nI repeat, the only other diners ahead of us were a couple who already had their food.  A handful of carryout orders got filled.  Yes, they were short-staffed, but it was clearly a slow night.\n\nWe could see the kitchen from where we were sitting.  My girlfriend swears she saw some meat -- ham?  corned beef? -- fall out of a container onto the floor, which the cook promptly put back into the container, which went in the fridge.\n\nMaybe he was just putting it there to dispose of later.  Maybe the five-second rule is actually an official health department guideline.  Maybe it was just some ham-shaped candle wax.\n\nWe flagged down the bartender, and managed to convince him to refill my girlfriend's Pepsi and get me some water.  (To be fair, I'd been nursing my beer in vain anticipation of the food.)  He checked in on the food, and assured us it was almost ready.  We could see our sandwich spend a good fifteen minutes in various stages of assembly.\n\nThe other table of four seated after us was getting equally ignored.  One of the ladies complained into her phone that she was being held hostage.\n\nThe food arrived.  Eventually.  Most of it.  We got our sandwich -- now cold -- and our cheese sticks -- deep-fryer fresh! -- a good forty-five minutes after we ordered them, and well over an hour after we first sat down.  I repeat, nobody was ahead of us in the dining room when we sat.  The bartender advised us that the wings would be a few more minutes.\n\nBased on past experience, I estimated how long it would take them to bring us our check once we were finished, and asked for it immediately.\n\nAside from being cold, the sandwich was very tasty.  And the cheese sticks were as awesome as deep-fried cheese usually is.  We finished what food we had -- and there was still no sign of the wings.  \n\n\""How many more minutes are those wings going to take?\"" I asked the bartender.  He ducked into the kitchen to ask.  \""Five more minutes,\"" he said.\n\nTen minutes ago, it had been \""a few more minutes.\""  This kind of dialog is very funny in a Guy Ritchie movie.  Less so in your neighborhood bar.\n\n\""Cancel the wings,\"" I said.\n\nI threw down a twenty.  I'm pretty sure it covered what we ate.  No way in hell was I going to wait for change.\n\nI think the table behind us was packing up to leave as we walked out.  Poor souls.  They never got any of their food.\n\nSo.  If you visit Verdetto's, it would seem your experience will hinge on who's working that night.\n\nIf the owner is around, expect fast, courteous service and some of the most delicious bar food to ever come out of a deep fryer.  An easy four stars.\n\nBut if you got the guys we had ... the bartender, while hardly attentive, was prompt when directly cornered and at least had the decency to look embarrassed by the awful service.  I don't think the cook cared if we lived or died.  Zero stars.\n\nThe only other time I've ever said \""Fuck this\"" and left before my food arrived was when an ex-girlfriend and I went to a Primani Brothers in the Strip before a Deftones show; they only had three people working, and were completely crushed under the crowd.  Verdetto's had no such excuse.\n\nIf you're in the mood for cheap beer, good wings, and you're really feeling lucky, give them a try.  But if you have someplace you'd like to be afterwards, you'll want to go somewhere else.\n\n(Also, do note that the kitchen is closed on weekends.  Perhaps it's for the best.)"
"2","During my recent visit to Pittsburgh I lived like a baron in the Mr. Boggs' Suite while staying with friends Karl Kargle and his partner in life and business Jeffrey Stasko at the former Boggs Mansion, beautifully restored and now called The Inn on the Mexican War Streets.

"1","This place is not what it once was. it is a shell of its self, with outsourced beer production, canned food, and bad service. Sorry to be so negative, it has earned it however."
"2","Man, we had such a fantastic time here last night!  The Boilermaker Jazz Band was playing, filling the hall with cool 1940's style swing and jazz.  I was actually glad to wait for a table, so the hubby and I could enjoy the show.  The beers were good, and I especially recommend the Marzen and Bock.  Seating is family style, so you'll likely be seated next to strangers if the place is busy.  We like meeting new people, so talking it up with our table-mates and listening to the band made it feel like a party.  A party with 5 different types of wusrt, that is!  I highly recommend starting with the K\u00c4SE kugel mit speck, which is basically German mac and cheese. Topped with bacon.  Oh yeah.\n\nI'm looking forward to their Mardi Gras celebration!"
"2","Given the mixed reviews, I wasn't quite sure to what to expect when I came here recently. And fittingly, I'd say my experience was mixed, although overall positive.\n\nWe went on a Saturday evening, and I thought the place would be hopping, but it was sort of dead. The space is beautiful though, and it was a shame that their charming courtyard beer garden was not being patronized by more people that evening. We were seated indoors in their downstairs area, which was cozy, but a bit dark and dungeon-like. The evening started off on an annoying note when it took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order (though he was more attentive after that).\n\nOur waiter was hilariously blunt. Several times when we tried to order something, he shot us down with his unsolicited (though actually appreciated) opinion:\n\nUs: \""We'll try the mussels to start.\""\nWaiter (with horrifying look): \""No, you don't want to order those. They are really sandy.\""\nUs: \""Umm, ok, thanks for the heads up. How about the peanut butter and jelly wings?\""\nWaiter (gives knowing glance): \""How do you THINK wings with peanut butter and jelly would taste? Don't get those.\""\n\nLater for our meal order:\n\nFriend: \""I'll have the rabbit for dinner.\""\nWaiter (same horrifying look as before): \""No, no good. Literally ANYTHING else would be a better choice.\""\n\nThough it was a bit odd, we did appreciate his candor about the food and I know he was just trying to be helpful. Also it gave us plenty to giggle about every time he left the table.\n\nAnyway, speaking of the food, waiter man's tips were fairly solid, because we were pleased with almost everything we ordered. To start, we sampled the Black BBQ wings, which were meaty, juicy, and crispy. We also tried the pierogies, which were good, though nothing noteworthy (I can think of about a dozen places off of the top of my head that serve a better pierogie). On the annoying side, they only gave 3 pierogies in the appetizer serving, which for $7 bucks seems a little stingy. Also, 3 is an odd number of anything for an appetizer, as most dining parties are 2 or 4 people (ours was 4). Thanks for creating an awkward sharing situation, Penn Brewery. Anyhow, we also tried the pretzel and bier cheese, which everyone at the table liked except for yours truly (I found the stiff mousse-y texture of the cheese to be unappetizing).\n\nFor our meal, my husband and I split the chicken kasespaetzle, which appears to be Germany's answer to mac n' cheese. It was really tasty, with a rich, creamy, tangy and flavorful sauce, plenty of juicy chicken, and tender pasta dumplings. Our friends split the roasted pork, which they reported to be delicious as well. Entree portions were generous and more than enough for us to split and still feel full and happy (especially given the appetizers we had). For dessert, we shared the apple strudel, and our waiter was quite pleased.\n\n\""GREAT choice, that's the best dessert we have!\"" he exclaimed a little too enthusiastically after we ordered it. \n\nThanks, waiter, glad we finally could nail it on the first try. And nail it we did -- the strudel was heavenly. Flaky pastry crust and warm, soft apple filling paired with melty vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end our meal. Very good experience overall. Or should I say, \""sehr gut\"" experience overall."
"1","Beer was good but food was mediocre at best. I will not be going there ever again because I did not feel welcome. Not impressed with service."
"1","Foul tasting chicken. I don't know what else could make me so sad."
"2","This place is great!! Ask for amazing Amanda behind the bar! She is a perfect angel and will make you cry tear drops of pure joy!"

"1","Mandy's food is OK. The pizza is mediocre, often burnt,  but the sandwiches are very good. We moved to Observatory Hill about 18 months ago and we like to support local businesses. However, after 6 months of consistently terrible service we sadly had to find a new pizza place. Every single time I have called in an order I would be put on hold for several minutes right away. That is a long time to be on hold and I understand places get busy, but every time? To top it off the employees would often argue with me about my order \""we would like a large pizza.\"" Employee: \""you mean a 16 inch?\"" Me: \""I don't know, the menu I am using doesn't have the inches listed.\"" Employee: \""Well it's 16 inches.\"" Another time I was asked what size fries I wanted. I told them I didn't order fries. They had so much trouble understanding that I had not ordered fries that it turned into a yelling match. Never before in my life have I felt so harassed trying to place an order.\n\nOne time the delivery driver called my cell phone and hung up when I answered. I went outside and asked him why he just hung up. Driver : \""I can't spare the minutes.\"" This is the same driver who brings his dog in the car and when he isn't making deliveries the dog sits in his car all day in front of the pizza shop. What someone else said about the employees looking like parolees is definitely spot on. Some drivers will just call your cell and not even GET OUT OF THEIR CAR to deliver your order, instead waiting for you to come to the drivers window.\n\nOn one occasion I went to pick up an order at the store and the counter near the door looked like the pick up area but it was actually at the other end of the counter. Therefore, I was simply ignored until I figured out I was standing at the wrong end. Then the employee tried to make me feel stupid by telling me \""Yeah, I had no idea why you were standing there. No one has ever stood there before.\""\n\nSeriously?  It's just unbelievable how rude these people are. Check it out for yourself."
"2","Usually, I'm a total coward at the dentist. Like, fists clenched, legs tense, eyes shut kinda coward. I chose a new dentist strictly based on location and the review of the gentleman below, and I am beyond glad I did. Dr. Dan is amazing! \nI was at ease almost immediately, Eric is a hard person not to like, and Dr. Dan made me feel like I was in very capable hands.\nI'm so fortunate to have found you, Dr. Dan!"
"2","For years now, I have been telling my boyfriend about my hopes and dreams in life.  One that kept coming up, time and time again, was that I wanted to hug a penguin someday.  I was resigned to the fact that this would never happen - where on earth would I possibly be able to hug a penguin?  Antarctica?  Not going there.  Zoos - yeah, they have gates separating me from the huggable waddlers.  So it was just another dream destined to never come true - until my 26th birthday when my boyfriend presented me with two tickets to the Penguin Encounter at the National Aviary.\n\nI was so childishly excited when we arrived at the Aviary one Saturday.  We were early for the penguin encounter, so we explored the rest of the Aviary first.  I was surprised at how delightful and interesting it was - yeah it's just birds, but like - who knew birds could be so cool?  It's essentially a zoo for birds, which sounds boring, but it is not!\n\nMy favorite part (besides the penguins) was going in the tropical habitat room.  This trainer gathered up a big crowd of us and did a feeding demonstration which was awesome.  Only kids got to be participants - well, it was an unspoken rule, but how dumb would I look standing up there with a bunch of 5 year olds - so that was a bummer.  But wow - watching these kids throw a grape in the air and this beautiful multicolored bird swoops down to catch it.  Birds were rushing past me so fast I felt a breeze by my ears.  The air was just buzzing with life, and the trainer was really knowledgeable and gave us a great, interactive show.\n\nWhen it was time for the Penguin Encounter, i was thrilled to hear that we were the only two signed up that day.  Technically as many as 8 people can do it at a time, and I would've been so furious if there were 6 dumb kids getting all up on my penguin time, but fortunately that was not the case.  We were brought to a classroom, and sat on some low benches close to the ground.  We heard some weird honking sounds coming from behind a partition.\n\nA few minutes later, a trainer (Chris, I think?) came in, and opened a door to a little cage where our new penguin friend Elvis had been hiding.  Apparently he had been honking to alert us to his presence, and perhaps to ascertain whether or not we were also penguins (nope).  Elvis waddled around us for a while, rather disinterested, but he LOVED his trainer.  He kept plummeting into Chris's lap in this really hilarious way, flapping his wings with the sheer delight of being so close to his buddy.  To keep him still, Chris had to put a hand on his beak, and then Elvis chilled out enough for us to be able to pet him.  He was feathery, not surprisingly, and a very cute little guy.  Whenever Chris let go of him, he'd just sort of wander around and sometimes start heading away from us until Chris would go \""hey!  where do you think you're going?\"" and he'd waddle back.  Chris told us lots about penguins while Elvis tolerated our attention.\n\nAfter a while, Chris put Elvis on a table and we got to take some pictures with him.  I still hadn't gotten my penguin hug, so at one point I moved in a little closer to Elvis and he sort of tried to beak my face, as if to say \""back it up lady, we just met!\""  Learned that penguins don't really like to be hugged, and they mostly just tolerate being petted (unless you are their beloved trainer).\n\nAfter the photo op, we went outside with Chris and watched him put Elvis back in the penguin enclosure.  We watched him swim around in a showoffy manner for a while before we left.  It was a SUPER cool thing to be one-on-one with a wild animal (and an adorable one at that), but sadly my dream of hugging a penguin is not yet realized.  But maybe I should stop wanting wild animals to be like house pets, and just be content that I got to pet him at all!\n\nSuper fun day - definitely recommend the Aviary in general, and the Penguin Connection if you are a fan of the silly creatures!"
"2","The Clipper fleet is absolutely one of the best parts about living in Pittsburgh. I love seeing and learning about my city, and seeing my city from the river is about as unique as sightseeing can get. \n\nI have no (majorly) bad memories when it comes to the rides and events I've had and attended while one of the Gateway Clipper boats. Even the weather has always been good when I get on board a Clipper boat. Anything you could possibly want to do while on a boat, this fleet offers as a special event, including but not limited to children's events, dinners, fall foliage sightseeing, absolutely fascinating historical sightseeing tours, dance parties and 4th of July firework shows. If you do want to attend a special event, always buy tickets in advance; the Clipper fleet is extremely popular among locals and tourists alike.\n\nHere are the drawbacks: food and drink will cost you a pretty penny. In fact, you're better off eating before you get on board (fortunately, Station Square offers plenty of options, so this won't be a problem). And unfortunately, smoking is allowed on the decks of these boats. A friend and I actually ended up moving to a lower deck because someone behind us lit an extremely disgusting-smelling cigar. It absolutely ruined part of the evening as we looked for new seats on a very crowded boat. If we had not found new seats I'm sure we both would have soon become sick to our stomachs.\n\nStill, definitely fun, definitely worth the price of admission for the overall experience."
"2","I will always love hopping aboard the Gateway Clipper, no matter what the event! I most recently went on a 1 hour sight seeing tour ($20) in the evening. It was a wonderful trip, sailing beneath many of Pittsburgh's famous bridges, passing the point, and even shouting out to the Pirate's fans during a game with a giant Pirate flag and a huge toot from the boat! The tour guide was very energetic and knowledgeable about Pittsburgh's history, from the movies filmed in our city to the myths and facts about Mount Washington, none of the tour was boring! I am really looking forward to attending some of the holiday cruises or a murder mystery cruise! There are many options to choose from, all of which are packed with entertainment and fun that won't leave you disappointed! As an added plus, you are free to snap away photos while on the boat, creating some fun memories and some unique Pittsburgh themed selfies!"
"2","This place is soooo much fun.  You can take just yourself or bring a huge crowd and you won't be dissatisfied.  The animals are beautiful and they have a great selection of animals from different locations around the world.  The aquarium is beautiful and you can even pet the sting rays!!  This place is very kid friendly.  Open year round with various hours.  Only closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's."
"2","I'm a zoo snob.  We hit the zoo in every city we visit.  This place was very clean and VERY well organized, but I found it a little smaller than I was expecting.  \n\nIt's always a bit disappointing when the one animal you drove 400 miles to see (Leafy Sea Dragons) is \""off-exhibit\"", but I understand the need to clean the tank every once in a while or whatever they were doing.  Still, would have been nice to have a list online or something so that I would have known that and we could have planned accordingly.\n\nAs I said, the layout is great, a natural flow that takes you past everything, contrasted with some zoos which make you plan a multi-step route and back track for a mile.  This was far superior in that regard."
"1","This is one of the worst zoos/aquariums I've ever been to, of the dozens I've visited throughout the United States and Europe. The exhibits are tiny, and watching those animals suffer is just awful.  I will never waste a penny at this place and am glad I got in for free this time."
"1","Greyhound in Pittsburgh gets no stars based on my experience today. I had a ticket to get on a bus to Columbus, Ohio at 7:45 am. So did 30 other people. Only 3 people got a seat. They were filled by people who were returning to the bus. No-one apologized to us. We were given the to get on a bus for Cleveland, but no-one at the gate could tell me the itinerary, or when I would arrive at my final destination. I had to wait in the ticket line to find out. I had to cancel my plans to meet friends and family today. I did get a refund, but it wasn't with a smile. I have never had such a negative experience travelling. Thank goodness Megabus is expanding."
"1","From the very first words I exchanged with the driver, I knew I would never be back. After attempting to make light humor with him, he told me \""I don't do jokes sir, I don't play games.\"" -So to the back of the bus I went! I transferred in Pittsburgh and boy was it an experience. The place was run down, poorly lit, and sketchy things were happening left and right. Had I not been so hungry I wouldn't have thought about touching the food. The bus I was supposed to board had somehow filled up already (though all of us from the previous bus had yet to get on) so we waited for over an hour while another driver was on his way. The next two buses, along with the previous one, were their old models, complete with mysterious stains on the ceiling since day one of operation. Sleep was impossible and courtesy was never found until I made it home (nearly kissed the ground)\nI sound to be a bit meticulous here, but I just want to make it clear for anyone who is unsure if they should go with Greyhound or not... DON'T DO IT! I know my experience was far from one of a kind. This is the prime example of a run down company with poor management that places customer service on the bottom of their priorities.\nAll in all, if there were a zero stars option, needless to say it would be checked.\nThank goodness for MegaBus!"
"2","This place has been around as long as I can remember, and is as good as I remember.  I've dined in, I've done take-out.  I was worried that they might not survive with the big chain competitor opening in The Waterfront.  Now it seems that the competitor is simply overpriced.  I'm glad to see that Me Lyng seems to have made it through and will continue to do well.  The prices and the food are definitely worth it."
"2","I love me lyng. Tuan, the owner, is one of the nicest people on the planet. He will greet you with a smile and provide you with anything he can to make your experience great. Wait staff can be admittedly slow but polite. They are young, mostly family. But the food is the best Chinese in Pittsburgh. Me lyng is the most underrated place amongst all the frequented Chinese spots around 15217. You can get the dinner for 4 and feed 5 for 55 bucks!  We get the sesame chicken, the moo shoo pork, beef and broccoli and the chicken lo mein. It's off the charts good. Comes with egg roll, dumpling, AND soup. You can't beat it. Plus byob. You have to check this place out."
"2","Favorite sports team of all time! Growing up I liked sports...loved boys playing sports and after trying my hand at cheerleading decided I didn't fit in with the conformation of cheering in a group. I was the bane of the squad because I actually watched the game and jumped up out of turn to go crazy and scream during riveting finals tournaments. Yup I \""ruined the cheer!!\""  I was too hyper to be a cheerleader and ended up becoming a stats girl instead. A much better role, for when the game was nail bitingly close I could yell and jump to my hearts content. \n\nThis being said I love watching sports and Hockey was the logical choice, that would make it the ultimate sports viewing experience, in my eyes. I mean hockey guys kick ass, the skills it takes ice skating with that tiny puck, the fighting COME ON! In college and highschool I went to many games and when I moved to Pittsburgh going to the Pens games became one of the best times I would look forward to. \n\nWhen I first moved we weren't doing so hot so the games were affordable, and easily attended. So my love of the Pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration. We have the best team in the league and soon after,  we won the cup!! Love, love, love! It's such a \""livable\"" city that it's possible to run into these athletes all over town! I won't give away where I've seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck bunnies sooo...get out there!  It's fun to see that SOME of them are respectable young men and behave, unlike many the football player. Sorry Stillers the Pens are number #1!! Lets go Pens!"
"1","Horrible customer service..Never expect the cab to be in time.. They cannot tell when they can assign a driver and we have been stranded for around 2 hours till a cab finally decides to arrive"
"1","Unbelievably unprofessional and unreliable service.  Despite calling ahead and later re-confirming the reservation time, a cab hadn't even been assigned to our 18 year old 45 minutes AFTER the scheduled pickup time.  She was left standing in the dark in a questionable neighborhood for over an hour - only to end up lucking upon a late bus to get her back to campus after an evening appointment.  Consider all other options before calling Yellow Cab; and be prepared to still have to come up with another way to get where you're going if you do decide to give Yellow Cab a try."
"1","We attempted to use this cab co. to take us home from two spots -- Carnegie Natural History Museum and Ross Park Mall. At Carnegie, We waited a1.5 hrs for a taxi to come cuz 1) Dispatch sucked and sent them somewhere else and 2) I swear the cabbies dont want to drive out of the way, so they don't. From the mall, no taxi was even dispatched! Again, they probably don't want to drive out of the way but then why not say so instead of leading us to believe they are at least trying. Feeling stranded in a city sucks. The city needs a better taxi service!!"
"1","Don't plan on getting picked up by Yellow if you are in Lawrenceville past midnight. I waited for over an hour for Yellow Cab on a visit two months ago and the driver never showed. We ended up getting a ride by a mysterious guy who drives a car with no cab markings named \""Mr. C\"" or something. Last weekend we were in the process of waiting over an hour when I decided to download the Lyft application. I had a ride lined up, an ETA and an actual conversation with the driver within minutes."
"1","There's a reason why everyone in Pittsburgh has a horror story about Yellow Cab. The service is absolutely horrendous. \n\nI had surgery scheduled in the fall and it was so early in the morning that I needed a cab because the buses weren't running yet. I called Yellow Cab over an hour before I really needed to leave. I waited for an hour... nothing. Then I got a call that they were at my apartment... they weren't. The cab went to the wrong place. When I asked the dispatcher to please send him to the right apartment, she told me I'd have to place a brand new call for a cab.\n\nI didn't have another hour to wait around, so I drove myself to the hospital. I had to leave my car there overnight because I couldn't drive home after the surgery. So yeah, that is just one of many stories I have of being stranded by Yellow Cab."
"2","All these positive reviews don't lie. Great place for tires! No appointment needed and I got the sense that this is the type of place that would prefer if you just showed up. Painted on the garage is a \""honk horn for service\"" note.\n\nGarage can work on 4 cars at a time so you're in and out quickly.\n\nEnter from the first enterance, closest to the city, or you'll have to back up and loop around the block like I did.\n\nFast, friendly and efficient service. Didn't try to up sell me but gave me exactly what I needed. Will definitely be back! Thanks for such a great tire-getting experience."
"2","I don't really know where these poor reviews come from - I've been eating at Kiku for years and have never had a bad experience. Yes, the lighting is dim and it's not exactly chic, but the food is excellent. Kiku was where I had my very first sushi, and it's hard for any sushi to live up to it. \n\nThe tuna and salmon rolls are always very fresh with the perfect amount of wasabi and their entrees are great, especially for those who don't like sushi or even Japanese food. And one of my all-time favorite foods is their tempura ice cream, with its sweet buttery tempura crust and fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Mmm. Delicious."
"1","I also had high hopes. In fact I drove from wintersville for good sushi. Instead I got low end sushi for a high end price. The service was 5 stars so feel bad giving two. The. Food was one star. So 5 stars minus two stars equals really bad sushi."
"1","No HEAT late Sunday (January) night and no one around to tell.  45 degrees for a 3 hour movie.  Too many options to go back here! Good Luck!"
"1","As we had done in previous years following a Steelers game, we came to this place as it was conveniently located from our hotel, the Sheraton Station Square. The eight of us sat in a booth that had a few dishes remaining from the previous customers. Around 15 minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes. Finally a young girl came to take our order. She apologized and cleaned off our table.\n\nWe ordered and then waited at least 30 minutes. A girl from our group went to question what was going on. Eventually the manager came out, apologized and said the food would be out in 3 minutes. At least 10 minutes passed. We questioned him again this time verbally expressing our irritation. He mentioned he fired 4 workers and took the blame. Regardless, we were all disgruntled.\n\nThen several minutes later the waitress came out and said she did not have any avocado and another ingredient and a few of our dishes could not be made. This was something they could have told us before we ordered and had to wait 40 or so minutes. One of the dishes that was supposed to have bacon came with baco bits instead. \n\nThe manager agreed to not bill us for the few items we received and with that we got up and left.\n\nWhile I do give credit to the manager and particularly to the young girl who was apologetic and did her best despite the circumstances, I find this kind of service unacceptable. This place is clearly mismanaged and this level of service has convinced me to never ever come to this bar again.\n\nIn order for this or any establishment to retain customers, it is important that they are fully prepared to service customers and if they are not then they at least communicate that to us early on so that our time is not wasted."
"2","Pretty good food and usually a good time. Staff always seems nice and knows what they are doing, always seems busy also...they have cheap drinks and usually specials. I recommend the wings or the provolone(fried).!"
"2","The place screams old-school Italian in a dated but kind of charming way. Started with the Seafood Bisque. Asked the waitress what type of seafood is used, and she was kind enough to get the answer from the kitchen (shrimp shells/tails and crab stock). Was not very Italian - more French in technique with a rich creaminess balanced by a splash of dry sherry - it was awesome, could have eaten a few bowls! My sister had the Caesar Salad, crisp and appropriately dressed. Nice little salad but nothing to brag about. We split the Crab Bruschetta - six small pieces of toasted Italian bread with a modest amount of jumbo lump crabmeat on each. The crab was tossed in olive oil, tarragon vinegar, and cracked black pepper. Not what I was expecting...very light and tasty. \n\nFor my main course I had the Filet. It was cooked correctly, seasoned sufficiently, and very tender. The beef is not grass fed, but it is from PA and fresh. My sister had the New Zealand Lamb Chops. They were cooked beautifully and nicely seasoned. Both orders came with a Baked Potato (with an obscene amount of butter and sour cream on the side), and a pedestrian vegetable medley. The proteins were defiantly the stars here. \n\nFor dessert I had a decent Tiramisu. Sis had a cold Godiva souffl\u00e9, which was REALLY good. If your a choco-holic you must try! Extensive wine list with Italian, French and domestic options, ranging from reasonable to very expensive. Two glasses of Chianti ran us $14.50. They also have a surprisingly nice selection of bourbon with a half-dozen quality options. I had a glass of Jim Beam Black Label with my steak since Sis was paying!   \n\nOverall a solidly above-average dinning experience with good service. A nice choice for people looking to avoid chain restaurants in Monroeville."
"2","First of all, I was surprised after reading the reviews to realize that this page covers ALL the Parkway House Restaurants in the Concord/Cabarrus County area.  I personally am only familiar with the one on South Union St, right outside of downtown Concord.\n\nMy husband and I have been eating their regularly since they opened, several years ago!  The food is always excellent, the service friendly, and the variety incredible!  I usually get one of their salads, and they do not disappoint....huge salad with ALL THE FIXINGS!!   Occasionally, I will splurge on their seafood....considering I do not eat a lot of fried seafood, and try to save it for a special occasion, imagine my surprise when I discovered that a local restaurant that doesn't even special in seafood has the BEST FRIED SEAFOOD in town!!  Perfectly cooked, perfect batter, homemade cocktail and tartar sauce....it just doesn't get any better....\n\nMy husband is more traditional, so he loves that they have nightly \""home-cooking\"" specials, and they are always delicious as well.  Can you tell we love that place....our favorite place to eat out casually in Concord!!"
"2","Best restaurant around the Mall.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  A trip to the mall, Bass Pro Shops, Dave and Busters and finish the day with some good food and great atmosphere at Razzoos.  You've probably seen the reviews of the food being spicey.  Their not lying.  But you can ask for some of it a little less spicey.  I personally don't think it's that bad, just warm.  My favorite is the \""combo skillet\"" pass on the shrimp creole and replace it with a double crawfish etouffee.  Pretty waitresses, short shorts, cold beer, good upbeat music, very interesting interior decor.  Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."
"1","If I hadn't been born in Louisiana and my family wasn't cajun, I probably could enjoy it.  But when I go to a place that claims to be cajun and I see only pale shadows of the dishes, I come away disappointed.\n\nThis place seems more about the Look of what a non-cajun would expect out of cajuns than what being Acadian really is.  Nowhere to be seen is the wonderful dishes like maquechoux, and boudin, nor were the sides near what I like.\n\nAt least I still have relatives from Lafayette who send me good sausage to cook my own jambalaya and gumbo the right way."
"2","New Orleans in Charlotte? Good Cajun dishes. Lots of fried stuff. The flavor can get lost in the fryer. The all you can eat catfish is the deal. It can be made grill or fried. Fun place."
"2","Great place. Menu is awesome, goes with the atmosphere. Like all restaurants, minus a star for no local beer on draft. Mixed drinks place for sure."
"2","This place has a fantastic atmosphere and even better food!"
"1","We have been to this location several times. On each of the occasions, the service has typically been pretty great. However, the food is always not been so great. The food is usually lukewarm at best. They even have new oven baked bowls which I thought would make the food warmer but if anything it was worse then the last time I went there. The food at this Olive Garden location simply sucks compared to other local Italian restaurant places you can find in the Charlotte area.  This is just another chain Italian restaurant that should be ignored unless you are in a city that only has the Olive Garden as an Italian option. Goodbye Olive Garden. I can see why investors and myself are done with this restaurant. Stale and overpriced. Peace."
"1","If I could give zero stars I would. I came here today for lunch with my sister and mom who is visiting from Florida. Our waitress was good but the food took forever to come out even though the place was empty. The food was alright except for my sisters food. The chicken was terrible. It looked like yesterday's chicken that had been reheated in the microwave. It was brown inside. Awful. The manager brought her food out the second time and ducked out of here like the place was on fire when she said it was still microwaved. This was terrible. The wall against the table was crusty with old food. 0/10 would not recommend and definitely will not come here again."
"1","Well...I tried this restaurant again...and again was disappointed. This time I tried the Roadkill. After all, how can you mess up a hamburger steak? After two failed attempts to get it right, I just gave up, paid for my beer and my wife and daughter's steak and left. I doubt I will return. By the way...nobody finished their meal. I also had their chili, which was tasty, but not very warm. When our waitress asked how it was I told her it wasn't very warm. To this she gave me a look like a deer in my headlights and made no comment whatsoever. I told her that if she didn't really want to know, please don't ask. The Sam Adams was (once again) cold and good tasting."
"1","The onion blossom was a tad burnt, no big deal still edible and delish. They kept turning the music up and down and switching songs, kindof annoying but maybe there was a malfunction. I always look forward to their dancing, they did 1 minute to a song that wasn't very dance-able and they were limp and no smiles.... Very disappointing. Waitress was nice, nothing impressive but nothing bad. Salad was good, shrimp were amazing and were a nice big size and flavored well. Then the steak..... I got the 6 oz which is super small, like kid size small. I got it cause I wasn't super hungry but geez, I guess I didn't realize what 6 oz looked like... Needless to say I ate 2 bites and let it sit... It was charred burnt on the outside, I ordered medium rare and it was barely a hint of pink.. Disappointing... I didn't complain to the waitress but she probably should have taken a hint when I told her I was done and it looked like I didn't touch my food and I didn't want a box... $80 later... I feel dissatisfied. I love Texas Roadhouse but will probably need to find a location with a little better service and food..."
"2","This place is fantastic on atmosphere alone.  It's a great place to sit back relax and hang out.  The bartenders are great!  I've been coming here for ten years between breaks at the mall, pre gaming, or even a bite to eat.  It's a good change of pace from your run of the mill frat boy hang out in university.  I highly recommend the Tom and Jerry.  Also great drink specials."
"1","went there twice in the last 2 weeks waitress just ignores me and takes customers orders that came in after me. I  then just get up and leave, they seem to care less."
"1","I love salad bars. Love. LOVE. \n\nBut I can't eat here. And by that I don't mean that it isn't veg-friendly - it most def is - I mean that the quality of ingredients, salad, toppings, potato bar, made-from-powder soups are so low that I get scared. Fear is an appetite inhibitor. \n\nI've hit this trough three times, and had gurgley tummy after each and every one. The ladies that work here are totally great - even acknowledge and remove and replace, say, the cukes, when I express concerns about their harboring of evil bacteriums and such (WOW they smelled weird last time I was here). But any effort on my part to save my and others' bellies from grossville feels like polishing the brass on the Titanic. \n\nSo I continue to harass Sweet Tomatoes via email, monthly, with the hopes that one day we'll actually have a decent Bar in Charlotte. Fingers crossed. I might start a petition. Let me know if you want to sign."
"2","I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing about it!\n\nIn MY opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in terms of authenticity.  I know there are a lot of trendy mexican-fusion type joints but this is just your old fashioned get your grub on type Mexican.\n\n\nThe GOOD:  The salsa is very good...fresh ingredients give it a little bit of chunk and the flavor is perfect.  It is a little runny but I don't like salsa that has been thickened by paste or because it was pureed.  I would rather the flavor with chunks of onion and pieces of cilantro--and that is what this place offers.  \n\n\nThe BAD--They serve the salsa in a very small dish and they have a disclaimer on the menu that indicates only the first two rounds of chips and salsa are free.  I mean, what?  I understand we are in a tough economic situation but you can't be a mexican restaurant and charge for chips and salsa.  We have managed to avoid that extra charge so far.  We usually just ask a different person for more salsa every time...I know, a little dishonest, but I can't help it!  I expect a charge when you go to some random place and happen to order chips and salsa as your appetizer (like Chili's or something) but any standard, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place should NOT do such a thing.\n\n\n\nTHE EXCELLENT:  Their fresh, tableside guacamole!  WOW!  I had no idea avocados could have so much flavor.  It was fantastic.  The flavors were bold and boasted of fresh cilantro, onion, and lime!  It was such a perfect combination of flavors.  I have had it with the jalapenos and without...either way was incredible!  \n\n\n\nI typically get the veggie fajitas and that is another reason why I love this place.  TYPICALLY, if I order veggie fajitas I end up with onions and peppers marinated in salt.  Azteca sends out grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes, squash, broccoli and mushrooms.  They are not weighted down with sodium and dripping in a fajita sauce....they are grilled and fresh.  It really is perfectly done!\n\n\n\nThe beans and rice and pretty basic--nothing to speak about.  The flour tortillas are great and their pico de gallo is fresh and flavorful.\n\n\nOne other downfall is that they don't give you the option for black beans on the side.  But, what I found out is that black beans are not as authentic in terms of Mexican food.  Muy interesante!\n\n\n\nIt is definitely worth checking them out...even if it is just for their guacamole.  You may want to bring your own jar of salsa though....just kidding"
"2","I've been going to Azteca since I was a little chica. My dad would order \""Mucho Margartia and Little Rockas.\"" That meant daddy had a rough week. The servers have always been super personable and helpful especially if it's your birthday. They make the most commotion of any restaurant I've been to. Out comes the drums, guitars, triangles, a cow bell, a wooden flute, and this one that sounds like your going up Thunder Road (wooden roller coaster, for you non-Carowindseres).  So much is going on... Can be fairly terrifying at first. \n\nAnd then they bring you food :) My fav, which is not on the menu anymore, are the three steak carnitas with cilantro and onions served on corn tortillas dipped in salsa with a side of frijoles. What great prices too! They now have a fresh salsa/guac cart AND a woman making fresh tortillas. Looks like a pretty hot job, but she is so cool under the pressure. I never finish all of my food, so then!.. I get to reminisce the following day. \n\nDeeelightful."
"2","This is my favorite Mexican restaurant, and in my opinion the best one in Matthews and maybe even Charlotte. It has great food and never once has anyone I know been disappointed here. It's service is good and quick. The food is great and seems to be always fresh. Definitely recommended."
"2","Given the suburban sprawl that has consumed Matthews as of late, I was surprised to discover a true \""hole in the wall\"" establishment that has been around for decades and, aptly, residing in a strip mall off the highway, complete with adjoining sketchy alley.  \n\nYou can tell Picadeli's has been around a while: the atmosphere is warm and dark with rich wood stained bars and has an unassuming welcoming like a family friend's kitchen. The staff are casual and kind and there is even a late 80s, early 90s arcade game tucked in the corner.\n\nThe menu is an interesting mix of things, ranging from burgers and grilled cheese to fish and chips. The star here, though, are the deli sandwiches, where the meat and cheese are sliced when you order and are generously piled on. And we're talking traditional Chicago and New York sandwiches with an amazing potato salad as a side item option. You can also order meats and cheeses by the pound to take home, too.\n\nKiller food, cheap prices, and a local landmark of sorts make this a great lunch spot that I plan to visit again and often!"
"2","I wouldn't say it's fine dining but I will say if you would like a good meal with an Italian flair, fair price and good service, Carrabbas is the place to go."
"2","As far as buffets go this is one of the better ones! I used to come here a lot when I worked in Matthews, but had not been back in a while. Did lunch here Friday and realized how much I missed this place.\nAs far as Chinese goes this is about as authentic as you are going to get at a buffet. I'm not saying it is \""real authentic Chinese\"", but it is for a buffet. You have to know where you are eating.\nI liked everything I had, soups were great, all the sauces I had were pretty good too! Wait staff was on top of refills, clearing the table etc.... All in all a great experience. \nRight now they are running a lunch buffet special for their 12th anniversary. My wife and I only paid 5.99 each, well worth it!"
"2","I was a bit unsure of what to expect, since I saw reviews all over the map of this place. However, I was in the mood for Mexican, and this place was convenient since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time.  \n\nWhen I arrived - between 1 - 1:30 on a weekday, I was seated immediately.  There were a few other tables with patrons so I wasn't the only person there at the time. \n\nThe service was pretty quick and menu offered all the standard options on a Tex-Mex menu.  Chips and salsa were brought out immediately and the chips were good, but the salsa was rather bland.  I had to ask for the spicy sauce to pep it up a bit. \n\nFor my lunch, I decided to go with the Pollo Fundido, and I must say it was one of the better ones that I have ever eaten.  The deep-fried tortilla was nice and crispy, and it was filled with plenty of pulled chicken and covered in a creamy-cheesy sauce.  It was served with a side of rice.   I was happy with the meal and my service was good.\n\nAlso, I don't normally order soda, but since they had Mexican Coca-Cola, I ordered one of those. They taste so much better when they are made with real sugar instead of the icky corn syrup that sweetens American sodas! \n\nAll in all, I was rather pleased with my visit and if I happen to be back in downtown Matthews with a hankering for Mexican, I will definitely stop back in!"
"1","Very poor service. We came at around 8 am and not very busy, but the service was slow and substandard. After being seated for about 10 minutes, we sat watching another table, who came well after us, received service before us. Once the waitress came to our table, she never introduced herself, but only ask if we're ready to order. She didn't bring out creams for the coffee or straws for the water and juice, we received the creams after we asked for them but not the straws. As for the napkins, we had to use the ones that hold the utensils. After we received our food, it was literally no more than 5 minutes, when she came back and put the check on our table. And here's the best part, as she walked away she asked us if everything was ok, and did not pause for even 1 sec to hear our response. And that was the only time she ever \""checked\"" on us."
"1","Ate here with a $25 gift card from my boyfriends work. We didn't come with any high expectations, other than a free meal.\n\nI knew there weren't going to be many vegetarian entree options, but there were NONE. Oh man, so insert the part where I have to look like a total jerk asking for a frankenstein-style salad with no meat, while the waiter looks at me like I'm crazy when I ask him which dressing is the best.\n\nThe salad was boring and small and overpriced, but it was edible.\n\nWe ordered a Bloomin' Onion for an appetizer. It was actually pretty tasty at first (or maybe I was just ravenous), but the more I ate, the more I could feel my mouth, face, and fingers getting soaked in oil. Ugh.\n\nI left the restaurant feeling kind of gross, but at least the facility was clean and the staff were polite."
"1","We went back to Outback last night thanks to a $10 \""gift\"" card and had hoped things had changed for the better but had not. I could drop my rating back half a star but my wife actually enjoyed her meal.\n\nThe reasoning behind dropping at least 1/2 a star is that Outback has deemed it necessary to skimp on their portions in order to make the plates more artsy-fartsy or more \""presentable\"", for those of you who drink with your pinky in the air.\n\nBlooming onion was a bit overcooked and the coating was falling off the onions. (Onions were STRONG, Altoids\u00ae are a must this morning!). Caesar salad's dressing was very strong, too. Mixed drinks were on the small side. I could've sworn the glasses were bigger before.\n\nChicken and ribs: I got a very tiny grilled chicken breast that was a bit on the dry side. The side of ribs were 1/3 the size of their normal full slab and they were the best part of the meal. Side of mashed potatoes were too garlicky and portions tiny.\nMy better-half had the sweet potato fries that were just \""okay\"".\n\nOur server, Noah, was great. Fast, efficient, and friendly. I could almost bump up my rating to another star because of him.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
"1","Worst outback I've been to. The service sucks and there food is not good. Very ran down so don't waist your time and money at this location. I do love outback tho, just not this location."
"2","Kristopher's Bar & Restaurant Is a great place if you like sports bars ! For Me I'm there for the Buffalo Wings. I love the Hot Honey and yep 2 Dozen its a bit much for one person but what the hell its not like i go every week and I have leftovers for the next day. It gets crowded so get there early its always packed. The staff is super nice and if your into Sports on TV they have them everywhere ! They are right on the corner in downtown Matthews and you can't miss the Big Green awning for outside seating. Grab your friends and family and go try it ! Its just a cool place to hangout drink and grab some Good bar food....again I love the wings there. \n\n\nBuffalo Wings\nA dozen chicken wings served with crisp celery and blue cheese.\nYour choice of\nMild *Plain*\nMedium\nKicken Ranchers\nHoney Mustard\nHot Honey\nHot\nGarlic Hot \nBBQ\nTeriyaki\nSpicy Teriyaki\nCaribbean Jerk Rub\nJamaican Jerk Sauce\nRobby Wings *Crispy Double Fried*\nFirecracker\nSizzling BBQ\nExtra dressings 25\u00a2 each.\nAdd Carrots 50\u00a2 extra\n\n$10.99\n1 Dozen\n\n$21.99\n2 Dozen"
"2","Good food, great bar atmosphere with lots of TVs! Beer specials could be better, but certainly not the worst. Outside patio is an amazing space to watch the games."
"2","It's actually been a bit since I've been here, but I wanted to mention this place for at least two reasons.\n\nOne is that it's easy to overlook - there is a big Hops location out front (which has really bad service, or did the last time I was there), and you're likely to not look behind it.  This means that I tend to forget that it's even there.  Add in the fact that it's a strip mall, and you don't go looking for places in a strip mall often.\n\nTwo is that the place is actually something of a hidden gem.  Yes, it's a chain of sorts (though I haven't often seen other locations), but they aren't like a McDonald's or anything, so it's still a bit different.  Throw in a helpful staff and tasty selections, and you have a decent place to grab a bite.\n\nAs mentioned, they can be a bit on the pricey side (not too bad overall), but it's one of those places that is worth it.  Get over the fact that they are in a strip mall and you'll be fine.  In fact, put them in a different location, say South Park or Uptown, and they'd probably be considered cheap."
"1","I went to dinner with a friend and ordered the jumbo shrimp & scallops.  When the plate arrived, it had THREE scallops and FOUR medium shrimp - not jumbo at all and I asked the waiter to send over the manager.  I asked her if they skimped on this order of so few scallops and shrimp for such a HUGE price and she said this was the standard order.  I told her to take away this order and bring me an appetizer of bang bang shrimp, which was good, that I had for my dinner.  There is absolutely NO value for your money at this restaurant and I was so surprised that people in this town like to pay for so little food at such a HUGE price.  Hard to believe this restaurant is still open.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all."
"2","I attended a breakfast meeting for one of the organizations I belong to, and the club did a fabulous job.  Raintree is located in the heart of the Raintree neighborhood in South Charlotte.  It is conveniently located to the Arboretum area, and I-485 for an easy in and out.  The staff was courteous and kind, and went above and beyond to get me a cup of tea when coffee was the only thing offered on the buffet.  Going the extra mile always impresses me!  \n\nI would reccommend booking your next medium to large function at Raintree!\n\nBTW....the golf and tennis is great too!"
"2","I mean really how can you beat a movie theater with extremely cheap tickets??  Yeah it's not the newest or the nicest, or even the cleanest (bathrooms are yuck).  But when you don't spend a small fortune on a movie and some snacks and you can have an enjoyable evening out with a good movie, I'd say its a win all around!"
"2","Let me preface this review with the fact that I grew up in Northern Virginia so technically I would be a \""Yankee\""  We did not have the pleasure of Bojangles up where I grew up, but I think it's slowly starting to make its way into VA.  Popeye's was my absolute favorite (and still is in some respects) but livin' in the south, I gotta give props to Boj's.  \n\nUnfortunately I've put myself on a diet, but I really really do enjoy Bojangles when I do get it - when people from out of town come in.  It's a great excuse to get some good chicken, biscuits, and sides.\n\nThis location is off Independence Blvd.  Unfortunately you can't get to it easily when you are traveling East - just make a U-turn and you are good, but getting back out (if you want to continue East) can be a little tricky.  Other than the logistics, the chicken is great... the staff is always friendly... and the place well kept."
"1","MWas in yesterday with Rosie for her routine vaccination. The receptionist was very cold and not hospitable. We arrived 20 min. early, yet still waited another 20 min. for her to get seen. Tech and Dr. where GREAT!!! Upon leaving and scheduling Rosie's surgery the same receptionist proceeded on giving us instructions for surgery appt.  With a harsh tone of voice reminded us about missed appointments!!! Yes I DID call and rescheduled 3 times due to death in the family. I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed this time. We will have Rosie's surgery there, but will not return to that location."
"1","I too like Sub Station's food... But not when I get it from this particular store. It kinda makes my skin crawl. They also don't seem to have room for the bread toaster any longer like the other stores do, which I would attribute to the horde of personal items they have stacked behind the counter... Hundreds of old VHS tapes!? They don't keep the tables clean, the dining area is in DESPERATE need of some TLC. Broken video games, old dusty house plants, peeling paint. Looks like they just don't care and I have no idea how they've made it past the health inspector this long. GO TO A DIFFERENT SUB STATION, NOT HERE!"
"2","I give the place 2 stars(wings are good...pass on everything else) for their food and two bonus stars  for being the best place in town to watch a Phila Eagles game!  E-A-G-L-E-S!!"
"2","Simply put, this is the best Thai in Charlotte.  Nothing too fancy, just a lot of the basics done consistently and without unnecessary frills.  This is like that little unassuming hole in the wall that you almost have to know about before you're willing to walk in and try it.  But once you do sit down, you know you've found a gem you'll come back to again.\n\nThai Taste has been around since my high school days, always in the same building, and I don't think the decor has changed one bit.  Neither has the menu, but then you don't go messing with a good thing.\n\nLet me just say lunch is a much better value here than dinner- if for no other reason that you get a small bowl of a simple soup and a crispy spring roll served with a side of orange sauce, regardless of your entree choice.  Yes, it can be crowded at the height of lunch, but I've never had to wait long, even when people stand around outside the (only) door.  If you wait till 1 PM or beyond, you'll just about have the place to yourself.  The crowd is generally a mix of suits and the more casually dressed, with a few cops and the scrub-wearing hospital workers thrown in for good mix.  \n\nThe lunch menu is a much-abbreviated version of the dinner menu.  A single laminated page of about 8-10 dishes that each have a good, plain english description of what it is you are browsing.  Want a classic not on the menu?  Just ask- the menu does rotate by the day of the week so they will make just about anything for you if it is a traditional Thai dish.  \n\nYou get your choice of meat with each entree, which determines the price, or you can always choose to go vegetarian, which usually means tofu, though you can decline the same, as you can also decline eggs in the dish as well.  Here's my best tip- if you like Pad Thai (Pud Thai here, per the menu) get the vegetarian option if you like extra colorful veggies.  Lots more broccoli and carrots than if you order a meat.  Tofu is sauteed on the outside, but absorbs the wonderful peanut sauce that is the base of the dish.  Portions are always generous, so come hungry.\n\nUn-sweet iced tea is included with every meal too, they'll usually bring a small pitcher for your table.  Here's my second tip- drink the tea, you'll need it if you like any advanced level of spice.  Coke and other soda is available, but it is served by the can and costs extra.  You already effectively paid for the tea in the price of the lunch, so drink it.\n\nIf I had one complaint, it is this- they ask you how spicy you like your dish and indicate the same using 1-5 \""stars.\""  In my experience, the only difference between 1 and 5 stars is the amount of red pepper flakes dumped on top of the finished product.  1 is to little, 5 is just too much.  With the number of Thai peppers and sauces available, I'd like to think we could do better here, but it's just not to be had here.\n\nNote this restaurant now has other locations in both Matthews and University City.  Don't be fooled, the original still stands above the rest."
"1","Some of the worst Thai I've had in Charlotte. Which is sad, I really wanted to like it."
"1","Normally if a place isn't good I wouldn't do a review but I will for Thai Taste because Im surprised at how bad it was! Ive always heard good things about this place. \n\nI ordered Chicken Pad See Ew and they gave me complimentary fried shrimp/egg roll things. I was hungry so I was ready to dive into my food but, it just wasn't good!\n\nThe chicken looked poor in quality and it had an odd smell. I couldn't help but to think of dirty mop water the whole time I attempted to eat it. On top of not being able to finish it my stomach turned and I had heartburn for the rest of the night. I will not order take out again; first & last time for me!"
"1","My husband and I have been wanting to try Thai Taste for a while now, as we love thai food and it is fairly close to our apartment. Unfortunately, for us, we weren't super impressed with the service or food. \n\nWe ordered delivery on Sunday night. I was told it would be an hour wait, which was completely fine! 2 hours came by and I was literally about to call the place when the delivery guy knocked on the door. He apologized for being late (kinda laughing while saying it) and said they lost our ticket. I mean, I get it, people make misstakes in life. But geez, throw in a egg roll or something or atleast be sincere with an apology. Because of this, I have a feeling our food was just sitting under a warmer for a very long time.\n\nI ordered the red curry chicken and my husband ordered the chicken pad thai. The red curry was actually very good. Big portion of chicken, veggies, rice, and red curry sauce. The pad thai was very much lacking. It was super sweet (even though we asked for like 4 star spicy) and tasted crazy bland and a bit stale (maybe like it had been sitting under a warmer for the past hour). Prices were a bit high for dinner. With tip and delivery fee, our total was about $30 or so. \n\nIf we decide to go back again, we definitely will be skipping the delivery and just picking up instead."
"1","A group of co-workers told us about the great Grouper sandwiches at Vinnie's. We both ordered.  He had the blackened and I had the fried.  My sand which was not particularly sweet as true Grouper.  However what really got my angry what the waitress bragged about how it was flow in daily.  I should have know by the blurred tramp stamp she was a liar twice over.  Turns out the business has been caught not once, but twice for selling catfish as grouper.  I would gladly pay extra for true fresh grouper.  \n\nWhat is interesting is they were caught by the Charlotte Observer. Here is what they found.  \n\nMore restaurants caught in fish-switch\nAre you getting the fish you paid for and the fish you ordered, or are you eating something else entirely? We've asked the question before and found surprising results.\n\nNow we are putting local restaurants to the test again.\n\nBuying one thing and getting another? Is it fraud? A mistake? An oversight? Or a cheap way to increase profits margins? Whatever you call it, you can't call it grouper. Our hidden camera investigation took us to nine different local restaurants, all selling grouper.\n\nWe ordered the grouper, put the sample into a bag, on ice, and in the mail to be DNA tested at the Guy Harvey Research Institute at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauder dale.\n\nOur mission? To find out whether, seven months after we first busted local restaurants substituting grouper with cheaper fish, restaurants have learned their lesson.\n\nThe results? Out of the nine restaurants we tested, a third were not giving you the grouper you ordered.\n\n\""I'm a bit surprised because I thought with all the publicity from the last time we found a lot of substitution, restaurants would sort of get the message that (there) are forensic methods that are able to identify whether they are substituting seafood or not,\"" said Dr. Mahmood Shivji, Nova Southeastern University.\n\nHere is the kicker, Vinnie's---Read on friends....\n\nOur third failure is a repeat offender: Vinnie's Raw Bar on South Boulevard. The first time we found catfish masquerading as grouper in their signature original grouper sandwich, the manger told us, \""We don't condone any misleading whatsoever.\""\n\nReally? Because here's what happened when we called to order the blackened grouper sandwich this time:\n\nOrdering over the phone, Anna said, \""I'd like to order the blackened grouper sandwich that you have?\""\n\nThe Vinnie's waitress asked, \""Blackened Grouper Sandwich?\""\n\n\""That's right,\"" said Anna.\n\nWhen we shipped the \""Vinnie's Blackened Grouper\"" off to the lab, DNA tests showed that grouper is really catfish.\n\n\""It's quite disturbing because that same restaurant was found substituting the first time, clearly they have (not) learned their lesson and they've done it again,\"" Shivji, our DNA scientist, said.\n\nSo everyone stop patronizing this establishment.  The number of articles in the local papers are all lies.\n\nFeel free to call these fraudsters \n\nhttp://www.vinniesrawbar.com/index.htm"
"2","Since moving to their new location next to the 131 Main on East, I've become a bigger fan of East Blvd Bar & Grill. The old location was dark and smoky, whereas the new location has front windows that open up similar to garage doors to allow patrons to enjoy the beautiful weather in the spring, summer and fall. \n\nThe service is always very good, and the menu has multiple vegetarian options, which is nice. But ultimately, this is a bar, so expect bar food and good drinks. The Bloody Mary's are very good, as are the mixed drinks; they definitely are not shy with the liquor-to-mixer ratio.\n\nThe best meal on the menu is the tuna salad with fries. The handcut fries are beyond delicious (ask for cheese on them and then dip in ranch - I realize that is very unhealthy, but let's be honest - you're at a bar). The tuna salad is the best in town, and you can get  it served cold or as a tuna melt.\n\nGreat place to have a quick lunch or meet up with friends on a nice day for some appetizers and drinks on a sunny afternoon. There is plenty of parking in the covered deck, and being on East Blvd, it's very close to multiple boutique stores for shopping as well as Freedom Park if you'd like to try to work off some of your meal after you eat."
"1","I've been meaning to eat here since I read about the best sandwiches in Charlotte in CLT magazine. Their chicken Philly steak made the list. Unfortunately, the sandwich didn't make my list. At least not a good list. Not sure who assembles these lists of best sandwiches in town, but I've been driving around tasting them all and I have not been impressed by one of them. I had some of my son's French dip, and I have to agree with another yelper. Not good at all. But I will carry on looking for places in CLT I can brag about. Yelp on!"
"1","The man serving me was very rude. I tried to ask a question before ordering and he brushed me aside.  Then I got my order and it was not what I expected - egg in chicken salad!? I had to chuck the whole thing."
"1","After being given a couple of recommendations from people and co-workers I finnally decided to give The Sub Station a try. I decided to try their steak and cheese. Being able to get whatever add-ons I wanted without extra cost is great, the fact that I didn't get much or that they weren't evenly distributed wasn't so much. I decided on a nice bowl of soup to go with the sandwich, watery cheddar and stiff broccoli. Which had to be microwaved before served.\n\nAnd that was only my first experience.\n\nThinking it may have just been a bad day, or I made the wrong choice in sandwhich (which shouldnt happen in the first place) I chose a chicken sandwhich. Again, getting tons of add-ons the only consistent one was the slices of tomato and lettuce, I was lucky enough to count three pieces of chopped onion and there was No oil and vinegar. So I had to ask for some ranch, which was pitifully bland.\n\nI could be just catching them on a bad day, but if everytime I go there is a bad day for them. Maybe I'll just stay away so they can have good ones from now on. \n\n3X3 Analysis:\n\nPros:\n- Nice amount of seating which is not intrusive to the order line or drink station.\n- Decent wait time.\n- Free refills (though I'm not sure if they were free or they just don't care).\n\nCons:\n(I'll have to narrow this down as I am only putting the top three in)\n- Bored or uninterested staff, it seems they'd much rather be somewhere else or doing anything but making food.\n- Disinterested for the care of the sandwich, not one of the sandwiches I got were well built.\n- Almost total lack of condiments, your only choice besides oil and vinegar is Sarachi sauce. \n\nFinal Decision:\nI doubt I will be returning there by choice. If I absolutely have to I may just ask for some chips and a large soda. Maybe a pack or two of crackers. So long as its nothing they actually make."
"2","The service is really friendly here.  I like how it feels personal and how the staff remembers you.\n\nI don't remember ever getting much of a wait in line - either that's because their service is so quick or I just hit it right sometimes.\n\nMeat is good, and they're not stingy.  I like the condiments/toppings, especially the pickles.  Tomatoes are fresh and good, too."
"1","I have found them to be less than accomodating or helpful."
"2","Definitely like this place...If you are in for a calorie filled treat order \""the usual.\""  I pretty much order something different every time I go.  For some reason my boyfriend does not like this place as much as I do.  Maybe bc the last time we went they stuffed him in the tiniest booth in the place, which I really loved but may be more suited for two women or maybe you shouldn't order \""the usual\"" if you sit there.. ( :  I love the upstairs booths at night when they have the candles lit.  Always have great service.  Very reasonably priced wine and food.  Cute location."
"2","This is a pretty nice place-\nIt is reasonably priced and the service was very good, so were the drinks.\nI ordered the salmon and it tasted very good, although it was a little dry.\nThe atmosphere was very nice, although the restaurant is very small inside.\nThis means that there isn't much room between the tables, hence I could hear the conversation held by everyone near me.\n\nOtherwise a very good place, would definitely recommend it to others."
"2","First time here, really wanted brunch but didn't realize they only have it on Sundays. Had their local grass fed burger and it was delicious. Full bar with a great draft list and located in a really quaint house style setting."
"2","Excellent lunch. Special peach/bourbon chicken sandwich and the Harvest salad with shrimp and the Chilled cucumber soup were incredible."
"2","This place never disappoints.  I have never had a bad meal here.  There are always plenty of vegetarian selections to choose from.  I recommend making a reservation as they are always busy!"
"1","From what I hear 300 East used to be a good restaurant. Not anymore. \nTonight was the 4th time I've been there in the past couple years. The first 3 trips weren't bad but definitely weren't good. Tonight was more along the lines of awful. \nService: awful. It tooke us over 2 and a half hours for dinner for 6 people (We had apps but no dessert). It was slow, our waitress was absent, and it took them forever to clear our plates. \nFood: awful. Three of us got burgers and they were flavorless and over-cooked. My sister in law got the pork tenderloin and it came out cold. The crab cakes were eh. The salmon nothing special. \nThe few pluses: good local draft beers. Good coffee. That's it. \nIn a city with plenty of good restaurants, don't waste your time on 300 East"
"2","I found Summerfield on Angies List when I first moved here and have been going there ever since for all car needs.  I always feel great when I leave, never feeling like they are trying to take advantage of the blond who doesnt know a cupholder from a carburator.  \n\nToday I went because my tire has been losing a little air and when the verdict came up that the stem was leaking I was pretty surprised.  I had had the valve stems replaced at this same location last year.  As soon as I mentioned this to the sweet staffer he just handed me my keys.  No charge!  Summerfield makes you feel as though you are not handling a chore but instead visiting some buddies that happen to know a thing or two about cars!  Thanks guys!  :-D"
"2","This funky little eatery in the South End has grown quite a bit (not in size, but in appeal) over the last few years.  What started as not much more than a rather ugly yellow cinder block building on an oddly-shaped lot is now that and more - they've added some landscaping, a paved lot instead of the gravel parking and a nice outdoor eating area too.  Inside the food is the same great, simple combinations you're used to getting.\n\nThe cramped quarters also haven't changed much, but that's just part of the appeal.  As strange as it may sound, the sheer volume that moves through this place makes it possible to place your order and get a table by the time the order is ready - provided everyone cooperates and doesn't hog their table out of their place in line.  When you're done, get up and let someone else have the table, and everything keeps moving as it should.\n\nTable tops still contain business cards from around town, and there is plenty of artwork to see as well, and the atmosphere is worth coming for, but it's the food that should keep you coming back.  While the burrito is the namesake of the place, make sure you try the quesadilla too.  They are excellent."
"1","Searching for decent Mexican food in Charlotte is like looking for Big Foot.  Just when you think you spotted him, he disappears.  \n\nPhat's is a burrito \""get it and go\"" type place.  Not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'll get the major downer out of the way first, their chips and guacamole is pretty disappointing.  I've had better chips from Tostitos.  As a matter of fact, I think they were tricolor Tostitos.  The burritos are fair.  Not good or great - fair.  \n\nThey \""almost\"" have a dining room but that's beside the point.  If the food warranted it, I would come here every week.  It's a decent neighborhood spot that I will probably try again if I'm in the area but there's absolutely no reason to go out of my way to trek here on a regular basis.  I really don't understand five stars for a mediocre burrito and brown guacamole.  But if you come here with low expectations you just might like it."
"1","Do not eat here!!! I've been up all night sick. \nThe decor was cool, food was bland, the steak tasted like pot roast and the beans were sort of runny I normally am a mom and popper but in this case stick with chipotle or go to any authentic place down S.blvd. Didn't seem to clean \nI repeat up all night sick!!!!!! But enjoy if you are daring."
"1","I assumed that the BBQ chicken would be some sort of grilled chicken, not just chicken with BBQ sauce (at $1 extra!!!) that sadly just does not taste good in a burrito. \n\nI am disappoint."
"1","My daughter and I went a month or two ago. \n\n1. It's way out of our way but we went because we love burritos, we were in the neighborhood, and the place has some pretty good reviews here on Yelp.\n\n2. I got a chicken burrito and she had a bean or veggie burrito. The burritos were good but not fantastic. (Maybe it's why I forgot to Yelp about it until now...)\n\n3. Neighborhood parking was hit or miss. I drove around the block a few times before we spied a space in the lot near the outdoor seating area. The parking lot is fairly small and maneuvering in it gave me the jitters. \n\n4. The place didn't appear to be the cleanest. We had to wipe our table and seats before sitting. Several tables had trash and food strewn on them..."
"2","3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 for affordable services! \n\nThis review is for their brow threading only. Because, here's the sitch, I can't get my brows waxed. Why, you ask? I break out like a 14 year old girl. I know, that was probably an overshare. Nonetheless, I am always on the lookout for talented threaders who offer their services quickly and affordably. When I read Stephanie K's review that had mentioned eyebrow threading, I hopped aboard. \n\nI strolled in on a Friday morning and did not have to wait whatsoever. This may be different on a weekend. The decor is pretty nondescript, but that really doesn't matter too much to me anyway. I was there for my $10 eyebrow threading. Upon arrival, I was plopped into a manicure chair while one woman spoke to another woman in a language I don't understand, pointing to my brows and giving her instruction. Sweet Jesus, I prayed that I didn't end up with shards of eyebrows when she was finished.\n\nShe did a good job. The best, most exacting threading I've had? No. But a solid job overall. Some points that have to be recognized:\n\n-Cash or check only: No credit cards accepted here! \n\n-The threader threaded quite a bit on the top of my brow, but used tweezers for the majority underneath my brow. I've never had tweezers used so much and because of that, my rogue eyebrows are already growing back in the places where they were tweezed instead of threaded. \n\n-They listened to my request of \""cleaning up my eyebrows, as I like the shape they're in\"" - this is huge. It drives me bonkers when the threader takes it upon themselves to create a new shape for you that you didn't ask for. \n\n-The service took at least 20-30 minutes. I appreciate that the threading tech took her time and was exacting, but I'm used to a shorter service. \n\nI'd try Matrix again because of their attention to detail but I hope the woman who is threading acquires a bit more practice and speed in the meantime."
"2","What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. \n\nThe seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D"
"1","My friend and I used the recent $25 for $50 Groupon to check out Pewter Rose on a Saturday night. \n\nHonestly, I thought it was a little bit on the pricey side for what it was so I'm glad that we had the coupon. The atmosphere was pleasant but a little kitschy and I kind of felt that plastic tablecloths were inappropriate when you're charging $20+ a plate. \n\nThat said, it was absolutely packed in there. We had reservations for 8pm and arrived right on time and the hostess was able to find us a seat within about 5 minutes. However the first thing out waiter said was essentially \""We're really busy tonight so I hope you're prepared to wait a while for your food\"". We weren't in any rush and agreed that was fine. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive and kept our water glasses filled but even though we ordered as soon as we were able to, it was after 8:30 before we got our appetizer and 9:20, and honestly that was more waiting than I had expected to do. While the restaurant was full, it is not *that* large. \n\nI had the seafood risotto and it was pretty delicious and I would eat it again. My friend had the herb encrusted lamb and while it was good, we both found it to be overly salty. \n\nI might come back and try the brunch but I don't think I'd pay full price for the dinner."
"1","Rude!!\n\nI walked in and was ready and willing to make this my new tanning salon because there was no wait and it wasn't crowded like my usual spot is right after work. The guy at the front desk looked extremely uninterested and acted as if I was bothering him with my questions. Because it was my first time there I explained to him that I was looking to try this place out and wanted to know what kind of packages they offered, he pointed to a piece of paper taped to the counter and that was it (no help, no salesmanship). I asked if they had a copy of the paper for me to take home and look over, again he was rude and acted like I was inconveniencing him. He said he could print one out if I wanted, I told him I would like that and would get it after my session so he would have plenty of time to do that. After I laid in the mediocre bed for 15 minutes I walked out expecting to have the print out of package options. No such luck, the guy was on what seemed to be a personal phone call so I waited around the counter for about 2 minutes while I was completely ignored and finally walked out. \n\nI see now why there was not wait right after work."
"2","Einstein Bagels... carby yummy goodness... This is one of those places you really need to throttle back. They have every pastry, bagel and muffin you can imagine. My favorite choices are the breakfast bagel options; egg white, spinach, mushroom bagel and the Turkey sausage and Swiss. They have fresh fruit cups which are a good choice for your waste line but you know your bootie craves the pastries. \n\nFor me, the smell is a bit overwhelming when you walk in the door so I like to eat outside. Yes... to all that said the place is crowded and the parking is tight but it is worth the wait. It is still quick and relatively inexpensive to other options in town.  Enjoy!"
"2","Charlotte has a real lack of bagel shops.  Those we do have are primarily chains.  Lucky for us, though Einstein is a chain, they've got the bagel thing nailed and their location is great.\n\nRight on the edge between Dilworth and South End, this small shop has a mix of outdoor tables and indoor seating options- bar, big table, little table, etc.  The front counter is filled with the day's bagel selections and the folks behind are busily making sandwiches and filling other orders.  Don't see the bagel you want?  Make sure you ask, because they are usually baking in the back and can tell you how long it will be till the next piping hot batch comes out.  \n\nThe ordering system has recently been greatly improved here.  Order at one end of the counter and then pick up and pay at the other end.  No more trying to decipher your order form a hand written ticket or having you repeat to the cashier what you have- it's all electronic now, and that seems to speed things along.\n\nMy wife really likes the bagel bites here- a cup filled with little bagel holes, usually with a flavor.  Cinnamon sugar seems to be the favorite.  They also had pumpkin for fall.\n\nOne thing I am not a fan for are the bagel thin sandwiches- I just find the actual bagel thin to be just as thin on taste and flavor.  Guess I just need that chewy carby goodness to satisfy?  \n\nI am a fan of their coffees, though.  They do have a full espresso station, but I really like their coffee blends- especially the fall harvest blend.  They keep timers on top so no pot sits longer than a hour, that makes sure your cup is fresh- nice touch.  My only gripe with drinks is the woefully small beverage station.  Coffee mixers, tops, and the soda machine all share the counter-space.  The result is no more than 1 person at a time can really be there- get's crowded too easily and the last thing you want is your hot coffee sloshing around in your hands as you make way for others to squeeze in.  \n\nDespite this, I can't deny the goodness that is an Einstein bagel with schmear- or a bagel breakfast sandwich with a cup of great coffee to match.  Quick and easy on the weekdays, with plenty of room for longer stays on the weekend.  I say- on the whole- well done!"
"2","This is a fantastic place to find great gifts for even the hardest to buy for. A great selection of nifty books, stationary, candy, booze accessories and so much more. I have trouble not buying something whenever I go in."
"1","I heard great things about Price's. A colleague invited me to lunch one day and I finally got to try it. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed. I wanted to like the food- but I just didn't. Maybe I'm spoiled by my moms southern fried chicken recipe.  :)\n\nAdditionally, it didn't sit well with my stomach. Yikes! But if your stomach can endure lots of grease, you may like it."
"1","Not sure what the hubbub is about this place so took the fam to check it out....ummm big mistake.  Chicken is way to greasy and really wasn't that flavorful.  Give me Popeyes or KFC or heck even Bo', over it.  Sides were not to good either.\n\nif you must go for the experience of it, then shoot, go for it, but I doubt you'll go back again."
"2","A fun drive by adventure while passing through Charlotte. The handy tip from our cashier to take our boxes to a lovely neighborhood park around the block for a picnic dinner was what really made the experience... you don't have to eat on the trunk of your car!!!!"
"2","The other reviews for this place are really spot on. Cash only. No seating. Take out only. Be prepared with what you want (kind of feels like the soup nazi a little bit, and I am slow to make decisions - panic mode!). But it's pretty darn good.\n\nThe chicken is fresh and crispy. I had the 1/4 chicken dark meat meal. Really good chicken. They don't do fake/over processed  chicken, no boneless anything. And when we asked the lady at the register if they did chicken strips, she smiled and said, \""no, baby, this is real thing only.\""  Perfect response.  I'll definitely come back here, with a little blanket to sit on the grass."
"1","I used to take my all of my dry cleaning here all the time until they LOST my jacket. When I went to drop of my items, I was given two claim tickets since the other item required a repair. Both articles of clothing were going to be ready on the same day. When I went to pick it up on Saturday morning, the young lady working informed me they didn't have the jacket. After about 30 minutes of describing the jacket, she calls what appears to be the owner. Then they DENY that I ever dropped off the jacket!!! I was furious!!!! I showed her my 2 claim receipts. She refused to acknowledge anything I had to say. I told her I was not leaving until they found my jacket! She started threatening me starting they had video cameras. This place is absolutely horrible! Worst experience of my life!!!!"
"2","Definitely a good place to meet people, read, get work done, or kill time.  The staff is friendly... I don't go here often enough for the staff to get to know who I am, but they are usually quick and helpful if you can't make up  your mind on what you want to have.\n\nI've spent anywhere from 5min to 6hrs in here and you get to see a lot of different people frequenting this location.  I normally don't go sit outside, but there is plenty of seating everywhere.  I guess the only gripe would be the lack of tables with outlets nearby if your laptop is needing a \""pick-me-up\"" of its own."
"2","So instead of going to Gibson Automotive to get my wifes battery swapped out we had $20.00 off $100.00 purchase coupon for Pep Boys on South BLVD. Made an appointment for noon. At 12:05 Liz called and they said that we needed a new alternator and not only that the $20.00 coupon only works for in store purchases (it says car batteries right on it). I told her to pay for the battery and meet me at Gibson....5 minutes later Larry Gibson comes out with the tests from 2 different machines saying nothing is wrong with the alternator. No charge and hope to see you soon......Pep Boys wanted over $460.00.....free installation? Scam Artists (Pep Boys) is more like it. \n\nI have been taking my cars to Gibson since they were at their old location on South. I do not trust any other mechanics in town....thanks to Pep Boys for reminding me of that."
"1","As the story goes, in 1999 (or thereabouts), three guys from New York wanted a slice of pizza and couldn't find one.  So they stopped at an old gas station on Central Avenue in the Plaza Midwood area and created a \""hand crafted\"" slice, with real mozzarella, rich tomato sauce and fresh ingredients.\n\nSome seven years later, they have opened five other locations, including this spot on South Boulevard, and are still selling pizza by the slice (you can get whole pies, but the pizza \""buy\"" the slice is a major draw).  Sure, you can find a slice of pepperoni, but let's face it - why would you bother?  You can get pepperoni anywhere.\n\nIf you're at Fuel Pizza, get something different, such as the Fuel Extreme (basically a meat lover's dream) or the Barbecue Chicken pizza. Both are good and have the aforementioned fresh ingredients - but I would probably argue that they are representative of New York style pizza.  That's not to say that it's bad pizza.  It's quite decent.  but there is better pizza to be had in the city, and there is even better New York style to be found if you look for it."
"2","I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is). \n\nTheir wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.  \n\nI can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \""all celery\"" or vice versa. \n\nI prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect. \n\nI dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte."
"1","I live near this Fuel and have eaten here on many occasions. The mediocre pizza isn't my complaint (today). It's the terrible incident last night. I ordered a medium pizza for delivery. \n\n20 minutes after scheduled delivery I call them to check up. I'm put on hold for a few minutes. Then transferred to a \""manager\"". He tells me they ran out of pepperoni, so they couldn't make my pizza. He pauses and adds, \""I guess we should have called you.\"" Yeah. I guess I should have called someone else. No more fuel for me."
"1","Does this sound appetizing?\nOrdered a Chicken/Spinach calzone.  The guy took one of the previously cooked calzone dough balls from behind the glass and heated it up, then cut it in half and put in the filling.  It wasn't a calzone, really just a terrible sandwich, with none of the ingredients warm and none of the cheese melted.  The tiny cup of marinara included was not enough to drown this miserable, dry dough sandwich.  The only consolation is the take-out beer I got that washed away the disappointment."
"1","I have been a regular here for three years and lately I am very disappointed with it. Since they started their new policy of heating up more pastries, trying to get a breakfast sandwhich takes forever and its been so chaotic that they have forgotten my order or given mine to sonebody else on a few occasions. Additionally they have run out of breakfast sandwiches a few times now, including today, and its not like I got there too late or anything. Frankly it's become a totally annoying experience when it used to be a nice weekend morning retreat. Too bad the Dilworth neighborhood doesn't have many inexpensive breakfast options any more."
"1","Not sure what everyone raves about, service was terrible, and the crowd was thin.  I didn't eat, so I can't tell you about the food, I was going to eat, but based on how long it took to get a drink I went to Mac's to eat and you should too."
"2","Went here to meet up with some friends. They have a nice outdoor seating area with TVs so we could keep up with the NCAA game that was playing. They have a good selection of beer, however, I was disappointed with their specialty drink selection. Only a few to choose from and none of them were too appealing. I tried the one that I thought looked the best, but ended up sending it back and just decided to order beer. But it was a good place to meet up with a group so I would recommend it."
"1","Surprisingly back in my college days, I was here a lot supporting indie bands. At the time, the darkness & griminess of the place didn't bother me; not to mention the sketchy area.  However, now I'm older & more conscious of my surroundings. In my opinion place could sure use a makeover.\n\nThe pros are: good sound, two stage areas / rooms. Staff is no-nonsense (like the other reviewers said).\n\nThe cons: dark, dirty, bar area is small, parking lot needs improving (pave it?), bathrooms are unkept.\n\nYes, I know it's an old warehouse & yes, I know how expensive it would be to remodel. \nIf a band / group comes through that I really like, of course I'll be there to support them. I'll set aside my 'music venue snobbery' to go. :D"
"1","WATCH OUT!  \n\nKeep a close eye on your receipt and keep your signed receipt.  Case in point, I dined there with friends and we split the bill.  I gave money to my friend and they left the tip on their bill (large bill for the table).  The waitress mixed up the receipts and he signed mine and vice versa.  Nikko knows that they made the mistake but they will not fix it.  They want my friend that lives out the country to call them and pay them the money to fix the mistake.  Ridiculous! Food is overpriced and customer service stinks worse than a piece of sushi left in a hot car.\n\nNikko you have now lost a loyal customer and all of my friends...I will NEVER dine there again on principle that you refuse to make things right.  \n\nInstead of Nikko...I recommend Pisces Sushi in the metropolitan or Ru San's.  Try the tempura fried oreo's at Pisces...delicious!"
"1","I don't think I'll be coming to Nikko again.\n\nIf you are looking for fresh sushi at a good price, this is not the place to attend.  The prices have definitely been up since the last time I came through a few months.  Understandable in that they have overhead costs and a declining customer base, but the way to remedy that is not by having poorer quality fish and questionable service.  \n\nCame here late on a Friday night because a friend from California was in town and from what I recalled of this place, it was a nice hotspot at nights--lots of music and girls.  This time the music was blaring and there were a handful of co-eds.  The music bumping was a complete disconnect from the dining experience.  If the bar is packed and party people abound, it would make sense; however that was not the case.\n\nSushi was generally overpriced and the portions were definitely smaller.  I've been to plenty of sushi spots in my lifetime to know what is solid--this place, not so much.\n\nService was fine.  The guy was attentive and stuff like that...but I don't know about you, but hate it, hate it, hate it, when they try to upsell you and it's too obvious.   Upsell being a way for the server to get your bill as high as possible so they get a bigger tip.  We had plenty of beer, but he kept asking if we wanted more beer, perhaps more rolls, perhaps hot sake, I thought he was pretty much going to try to push anything so that his tip would be bigger.  When the server reeks of desperation upsell, it brings the dining experience down since his focal point is no longer customer enjoyment, rather it is how much cash-money he can put in his pocket.  \n\nI'm a sucker for pretty girls...maybe I come here again.  This time there was only one cutie at the bar...Place is pretty dead on a Friday night, hoping its better during the week? ;/\n\ndmo out"
"1","I ordered the Salmon with Gorgonzola Sauce for take out. I notice the bill and they've charged $1 for \""to go\"". WHAT THE HELL! I've NEVER heard of anyone charging extra for a pick-up order. Even if it's a delivery, I can understand an extra charge. What was even more annoying was that the packaging was lousy, cheap Styrofoam!! Not even worth a dollar.\nNow for the entree itself. The cook (notice my use of the word cook, not chef) had to be blind. That's the only way the fish could have been so overcooked. It was like a hockey puck. DRY and BLACK. The menu claims that the entree has mushrooms and asparagus in it. Again, the blind cook probably just put double the amount of mushrooms instead. For a pricey $22, this was the worst entree I have had in Charlotte. Two thumbs down."
"2","When I worked in South End, this used to be the place my coworkers and I would go to when we wanted sushi for lunch. Prices were reasonable and food always excellent.\n\nIf you do go for lunch, I would suggest walking there if possible. Otherwise, you have to park on the 3rd or 4th level, then take an elevator to the first floor. \n\nSide note: They must do excellent dinner/weekend business because that place was always nearly empty when I went at lunch."
"1","I made a reservation at Nikko the past weekend through OpenTable, but when showed up at the restaurant, the lights were off and it was closed.  There was no mention of this on the restaurant's website and additionally I was able to book a reservation on OpenTable.com.  So there I was, with a date, at 7:00 pm with no where to eat- a GREAT experience for me and my date.\n\nWhen I emailed the restaurant asking for an explanation, I was told that I must \""have the wrong location.\""  Of course I was at the only location I know, in South End.  They placed blame on me rather than taking responsibility for being closed after I had made a reservation.  \n\nI can't comment on the quality of the food or atmosphere, but the management.... extremely poor in my opinion."
"2","The very best hair salon! \nI have been coming here for 5 years now and absolutely love it. \nJosh, the owner, is the best!!!!!!"
"2","This place is surprisingly cozy and inviting, and the Middle Eastern food is delicious.   It's located in the strip of shops next to the Harris Teeter at Kenilworth Commons so don't miss it when you drive by.  The veggie platter/combo entree is my favorite thing to order- it's huge and it comes with about 8 different items and pita bread.  My boyfriend really likes the pita wraps and the potato harra.  The only negative I have about this place is that it isn't cheap- entrees are mainly $10 or more and the sandwiches are $6, but they don't come with a side.  If you are willing to spend a little bit of money this place is a refreshing change of pace.  Oh, and they have a belly dancer on Friday night."
"1","There aren't a lot of great places to eat in charlotte and I was hoping Kabob grill would be different. For the most part the food was good, not fabulous or 4 star worthy, but pleasant enough. \n\nThe chicken kabob was nicely cooked, but they went a little overboard on the seasoning. The basmati rice was good (I'm a big fan of rice) and the potato harra was okay, but way too spicy. The grape leaves, however, were disgusting--way too bitter, they tasted similar to grape leaves I bought at whole foods a long time ago (big mistake). \n\nI guess in charlotte this would be considered 4 or 5 stars, but for someone who has tasted the real deal, Kabob grill doesn't quite live up to it's high star rating."
"2","The Leo has to be one of the best salads in Charlotte; with its chopped lettuce and mint and parsley, cucumber and tomatoes it cannot get into my mouth fast enough!  The pita that comes with it is perfect for sponging up the remaining lemon vinegarette that is too tasty to waste.\n\nI like the falafel here, too.  Crispy on the outside and not mealy on the inside.  My hubs likes the meat specials and gyro.\n\nand the baklava?  like taking a bite out of an angel."
"1","One of the more disappointing wrap experience that I've had. \nI got the lamb wrap. Barely any meat, mostly pita and lettuce. No distinct flavor. \nOrdered for pick up and told them that I was going to pick it up at noon, when I got there it was waiting for me, but it was luke warm at best, so my guess is that it's been sitting on the counter for 45 minutes. The waitress was short and impolite on the phone, and her demeanor in person wasn't that great either.\nCosts over $8 with tax and doesn't even come with a side. \nIf I wanted a bland luke warm sandwich, I would have gone to Subway and paid less. \nNot worth it for the prices that they charge. \n\nThe only positive, the lamb was pretty tender; the two tiny pieces that I actually tasted in my sandwich."
"1","Told the waitress we had a meeting to go to down the street, and were in quite a hurry. She said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nIt then took about 20 minutes to get drinks, about 45 min to an hour for the food (which was wrong, but we didnt have time to get a new one), and about an hour and a half before we saw the waitress again to ask for a reciept. We were so insanely late to the meeting we missed the entire thing. \n\nWorst service I've ever had in Charlotte, not to mention the fact we specifically told the waitress we were in a hurry, and she said it wouldn't be any inconvenience.\n\nWent back about a year later, and the service was still ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!! \n\nWill never, ever, ever, go back here. Even though they do have good milkshakes."
"2","Love the Sunday brunch! Staff keeps the buffet well stocked despite it typically being quite busy. French toast casserole, hash brown casserole, broccoli casserole...oh my! yum yum & yum! Of course, they also have the usual brunch staples as well: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, biscuits & gravy & much much more. My only disappointment were the eggs benedict. Its hard to keep something like that on a buffet line in mass production and have it be delicious, in my opinion. It was 'okay'.  A little on the plain side for me. There is SO much more to choose from, so overall I say... it's fabulous!! (and all for $13.95....what?!)"
"2","Equal parts old-fashioned soda shop, restaurant, bar, and hangout. The location is absolutely crucial here. Located in one of the more walkable parts of South End, Pike's is a gem with a hefty menu complete with plenty of sweets and southern treats.\n\nHaven't been to Pike's in quite some time and this was my first go for lunch. Decided to dine al fresco and enjoyed every second of it. This time 'round, didn't go for anything on the sweet side of things, but rather went for the lunch menu solely. \n\nStarted with the mozzarella sticks. Both myself and my dining counterpart were shocked that they weren't the \""out of the bag\"" variety. These appeared to be hand breaded with a higher quality cheese than typically served. Marinara was standard, but the mozz sticks themselves were great. They also weren't covered with the typical panko, moon dust, crappy breading like usual.\n\nWent with the buffalo chicken sandwich for my entree. Holy craaaaaap. Ditch the bun, eat a few of the house-made chips, and enjoy the chicken. Not only is this sucker lightly breaded and flavored well with the buffalo sauce, it's straight up baptized in the sauce. Swimming, rather. I'm usually not for a pool of sauce, but this stuff was fantastic. It acted as a nice residual dipping sauce for the remaining chips. \n\nService was friendly, outside was perfect for the present weather, prices are fair, walkability is always a plus. Find a parking space along Camden or near Atherton and you're good to go."
"1","I've only been here twice. The first time I wanted to try it because I had seen the long lines out front on the weekends, and the second time because I thought the first was a fluke. \n\nBoth times the food was decent--standard breakfast fare with little flair. It was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't seem to justify the long wait.\n\nWhat was surprising about this place is that the first time I went there the server tried to tell me what to order. I was told that \""complicated\"" items take too long and I would be better off getting standard items like eggs or pancakes. I understand that they want to turn over tables quickly with the long wait, but pushing people off of menu items is a big turn-off for me.\n\nThe second time I went they were out of the item I wanted. I will try to get back there during the week when it's not as busy and see if my experience is better."
"2","Fun place. Great view of downtown.  A lil tight on the parking. The french press coffee was fun..."
"1","Everything I ate here today tasted like it was concocted in back from bags of dried egg, pancake mix, and the scariest of all - hollandaise powder. Fatty texture but not even a little butter or lemon flavor in that mother of all breakfast indulgences. Burnt, dry, microwave tasting omelettes, puffed and brown. Freezer-flavored hash browns with no crisp to them whatsoever. \n\nBasically, the best argument towards anti-corpo food that I've eaten in a long, long while. \n\nIt hurt pretty bad, as I used to frequent this chain constantly as a kid - the Kosher made my gma+gpa happy, dad went for the apple pancake, week in, week out. Smoked salmon, potato pancakes, it was all delish. And strawberry pancakes, with fresh whipped cream, were totally my jam.\n\nThis new thing sporting the same name is like the OPH I remember but nightmarishly riffing off the nastiest of Denny's. Potato pancakes thin like paper, eerily tasting of potato, floppy and gummy. Sour cream in tiny, spit-cup sized containers. Watered down applesauce. \n\nNo thanks."
"2","Showmar's, like many of the restaurants in Charlotte, is owned by a Greek family and features American meets Greek food at their chain of locations.  Showmars does american greek better than the most, and they are typically quite busy, especially during lunch time.  I recommend the chicken fiesta pita if you want to go Greek, or the all-american pita burger if you want something less traditional."
"1","I wanted to wait before writing my review after eating at this showmars location. I thought that the portion size was EXTREMELY small for a $12 and in comparison to other locations, but I wanted to be absolutely certain. After visiting another one today I can't believe the difference, I now feel ripped off even more and I've included pics to show why. The top is the calabash platter from the East Blvd location and the bottom is the Calabash platter from the N Tryon. In each photo I've removed everything from under the shrimp and in the bottom I've eaten maybe 7 from the platter. In the top I've eaten two. Needless to say I'll never visit this location again!"
"2","Walking into Mr. K's made me feel warm and fuzzy.  It is just a happy place and I imagine I would have been there every weekend if I was a teenager in the 50's/60's.\n\nI don't know if I have earned the right to review this place completely though because I have not tried the ice cream or burgers.\n\nWe had a couple chili dogs and some fries, both were very good and the chili was clearly homemade and fresh.\n\nThe place was packed, which is always a good sign but it also made it a little awkward when trying to stand in line to order.  I felt like I was hovering over others but had no choice!  Small ceilings, narrow walkway and being 5'11 made for an uncomfortable setting.\n\nHowever--cool place and I am glad they are still doing what they do best without charging an arm and a leg.  Well done."
"2","Woohoo finally I got to try this place! Loved my cheese burger. Had a BOGO coupon for and entree or sandwich my boyfriend and I shared it. We got two cheese burgers, one basket of onion rings (not the best) and drinks. Overall my experience was great. I look forward to going back here"
"1","From the north and looking for a good grocery store?  Stop wasting your time.  There is a grocery store where I grew up in NY called Wegmans and it is continuously voted #1 in the country every year, and not by a hair, it's a long shot.  So, I am not holding Harris Teeter to the same standard, but HT is terrible by any standard.  I don't know if it's the lack of food diversity in the south or HT's fault, but I have a difficult time finding many ingredients I need for cooking at home.  The prices here are higher than those of Wegmans in NY...that's right, higher than the #1 food store in the country in one of the most expensive states in the country.  The prepared foods section at HT is awful.  There are no decent hot meals; terrible taste and variety.  The bakery is no good either.  I have bought 4 different pies and returned them all.  Visit a NY bakery and learn what good is.  Deli?  Forget about it!  \n\nThe standard is far below what it should be here.  I think the corporate QC people of this company need to visit some other high rated grocers around the country to learn where they're lacking.  Food Lion and Bi Lo are crap and pretend to be nothing better.  The annoying part about HT is that they charge out the roof and anyone who has never left Charlotte thinks this is the greatest place on earth.  And one last thing, what the heck is with the check outs?  They're backwards!  You hand your cart to the checkout person, they slowly unload it, the bag dispenser is on the rotating track the groceries are supposed to be on, while you're waiting to pay there is a checkout person 2 feet behind you unloading a cart and bumping into you, and you're left feeling like you just fell into an episode of the twilight zone.  The only thing I dislike about Charlotte (besides terrible drivers) is the lack of quality food and grocers.  I wish a better grocer would merge or buy HT.  Better yet, I wish a better grocer would move to Charlotte and kill HT in market share.  If you follow commercial real estate, you'll notice that HT buys prime locations where competitors make locate, and sits on them.  This is their tactic.  Don't compete in the market on quality, put up barriers to entry.  Scum bags."
"2","The brick oven pizza is pretty good and their salads and pasta are also great.  While the food is good and the service pretty quick beware of the crowds.  This place is packed with yuppies and their children (I am talking tons of children), so you might have to wait a little while."
"1","I found this monogramming place in Dilworth and, although I don't need anything monogrammed at the moment, I wanted to check it out for the future. You walk in and are basically on top of everything; there is a pathway cleared amongst all the items and 2 counters that forces you in and around the store even if you don't want to go. I was immediately looked at as if I were in the wrong place as I had nothing in my hands to be monogrammed, and was quickly and snottily asked if I was dropping anything off. I was stuck behind a gaggle of women debating which Kate Spade purse they wanted done as I desperately tried to get out but could hardly make my way around them. I may try again when I actually have the need for some monogramming, and I will try to overlook the pretentiousness of the employees and clientele."
"2","My first visit and purchase at L&M Monogramming today! \n\nI came her via a friend's recommendation, shopping for a personalized new baby gift. The shop isn't very big, but they have it packed to the brim with items. Normally, I would call the store cluttered, but the quality of everything is so nice, I'll don it \""creative use of space\""\n\nLots of baby items to choose from: clothes, stuffed animals, luvies, bibs, etc. I ended up going with a tiger bear luvie by Gund. It's was $30, which was a steep... but it was a reliable and durable brand and the monogramming/personalization was included in the price! \n\nI also compulsively bought a beach bag for myself. Huge, unique pattern, nice material and only $30. I love it.\n\nThe staff here weren't beaming with hospitality, but they were kind enough and definitely knew what they were doing. Very professional.  I was in a bind with my gift purchase because I needed it by the weekend.  Embroiderer told me they were back up for several days, but when I told her I needed it ASAP, she finished it by that afternoon without a rush fee. Awesome! \n\nWould probably give L&M five stars if store was larger and more spread out AND/OR prices were a little lower. But meanwhile a solid four stars for quality."
"1","Usually Have a great experience but the last time was awful! The host was very rude and our server Jeffrey was slow and sarcastic (in a bad way) the food is always great, but over all dealing with the staff was not worth it!"
"1","So, I ordered delivery again. And, again, everything had to be reheated. Needless to say there is a $4.00 delivery charge, has anyone everyone heard of that??? I asked the delivery man about that and he said that was not his tip, so in addition I had to tip. I completed the survey I received with the meal and made a note about this. I have never seen a delivery charge, rather a minimum order for delivery. I think if they want to keep a delivery option they should think about mirroring every other restaurant in the area... Just my thought. For now, I'll pass on delivery as it doesn't seem to be worth it."
"2","The decor is just so fun and upbeat! I'm usually there a little later in the day, so it's not too busy or smelly. Everything is clean, everyone is friendly, and I always look prettier coming out than I do going in!"
"2","I have been extremely pleased with the care and knowledge offered here (and we tried others when we arrived three years ago). With two cats (formerly three) and a dog, we tend to be pretty good veterinary customers.\n\nEvery time we visit, we get plenty of attention from the doctors and staff. While they clearly are focusing their interest on the patient, they take the time to answer questions and explain things in simple and easy-to-understand terms. The \""take home\"" materials are also written in uncomplicated language.\n\nThe outer office is clean and well mopped. The files seem to be pretty organized and they are plugged in to technology, as we just got an email with our shot updates. The examination rooms are also very clean with plenty of room for \""mom and dad\"" to accompany the patient without it getting too crowded.\n\nPrices are reasonable and since we're \""regulars\"" they do give us the occasional discount on office visits and such. If we ever move to another part of Charlotte, we'll still come back to Long Animal Hospital!"
"2","What a pleasure to have my first NC inspection here!  I was helped promptly, not overcharged for the brake light bulb I needed, and I got to watch HGTV while I waited."
"2","This place is such an interesting idea, because it specializes in state auto inspections.  I usually associate anything with the government or DMV as a huge pain is the @$$, but this was extremely fast and easy.\n\nWe pulled up, they grabbed our keys, and 10-12 mins later the car was inspected and we were on our way.  You do not even have to make an appointment.  There is no doubt that I will go back here for my next inspection."
"2","This is the former Merchandise Mart on Independence. I just attended the Southern Christmas Show here the other night. Great place. It's HUGE! The Christmas show has been here for years. Lots of arts, crafts, food & festive stuff. A  Christmas shopaholic's dream, a husband's nightmare! Plenty of parking ($6 to park) and tickets to the show are just $7.50 at all Harris Teeters with a Vic card ( I knew they were good for something). This place has all kinds of expos & shows throughout the year. The Southern Christmas Show is a great way to get into the holiday spirit!"
"2","Food is good. Drinks are good. Expanded restaurant means that the waits are much shorter than they used to be. Seems cliche but the fish tacos are the way to go here. House margaritas are delicious and inexpensive (they also have an El Cheapo Marg that I think is only $3), but the house is way better and still a bargain at $5. Enjoy!"
"1","Tried the fish tacos and they weren't really exciting. The place seems like a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with friends but it's not worth a special trip."
"2","Great place to visit while in Charlotte. I saw it on \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" so figured we'd give it a try, great choice!"
"1","Ugh, stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips. That's weak. My wife whose gluten intolerant, asked for corn tortillas since it's a taco place and the waitress said all they had was flour tortillas. I ordered the special which had green peppers in the tacos. Since I'm not a fan of green peppers I requested the special w/ out the peppers.  Five mins. later the waitress came back and said the \""chef\"" couldn't take the peppers off my tacos as the special was a \""pre-mix\"". Pre-mix?! It's a damn taco, not French bouillabaisse! Once I heard that I knew I'd never eat here again. The food was decent but I'm not going back again."
"2","Another restaurant visit inspired by Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Went with my friend while visiting her in Charlotte. Was very excited to try their fish tacos and was not let down!\n\nThe meal started with their unique corn salsa, a delicious mix of corn kernels, green bell pepper and tomoatoes served with tortilla chips.\n\nFor lunch I ordered their Tuna tacos with a honey wasabi sauce which was served with a side of mashed potatoes mixed with jalapeno peppers sliced in and cheese. The tacos were excellent with plenty of tuna and the wasabi sauce was unique, tasty and had the right amount of kick to it. While mashed potatoes are not usually thought of as a Mexican side dish, they were delicious and the jalapenos and cheese really added to their flavor. The whole meal washed down with a local Charlotte craft beer was the perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon!"
"2","This is the 86th review of this restaurant so it's hard to make too many fresh comments, but I'll at least put my score into here for statistical purposes.  I cruised through the NoDa area and when I saw Cabo I recalled the decent Yelp! reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy (the rest of NoDa was a ghost town) and the service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeno & cheese 'mashers' which I presupposed meant mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I was giving the beans and rice, kind of a downer as my GF ordered the beans and rice and we wouldn't get to see what both sides were like.  In the server's defense, she did ask a moment after bringing it out if everything came out right.  I enjoyed everything else enough to just overlook the error.  The chips and salsa were good and, as this was my first time here, came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.  Price-wise I think it was about what I expected $22 for two meals w/ water and tax+tip.  If it was half that price I'd be here everyday perhaps.  One more note, they let me switch the cilantro (yuck) white sauce for honey wasabi (yummy) sauce without a problem."
"2","I am not a seafood fan at all. The only time I eat it is when I am by the coast and that is out of obligation.\n\nThat being said, when someone decided we should go to a place that serves fish tacos, I could think of nothing more disgusting. But because I am always willing to try a restaurant's staple dish, I bravely tried a mahi mahi fish taco.\n\nI don't get surprised by non-desert foods a lot, but wow!! I loved it! In fact, for the next several days I actually had fish taco cravings. Since that experience I have been to a few places where they recommended their fish taco, hoping to satisfy the craving I would eat them but they were horrible compared to Cabo Fish Taco.\n\nI have now been back several times and have even guided a few friends into trying a fish taco. I still don't eat seafood but love these fish tacos. The complimentary homemade salsa is really good too.\n\nWord to the wise though, if you have a group bigger than four people, show up really early or plan on a wait. They don't take reservations. And only have a few places that seat bigger parties."
"2","Never thought I would ever say this....but I have found fish tacos as good as the ones I grew up with in California. Cabo is a fun and cool hangout in an already cool and eclectic NoDa neighborhood. 4 stars because my wife was not a fan of their margaritas, but if you are in downtown Charlotte pop over to this place, it's worth the wait"
"1","Mediocre food.  Absurd wait times.  Cilantro in every pore of the meal.  REALLY REALLY LOUD.\nCabo, I'm just not that into you."
"1","Hipster hangout. Flavorless food. Difficult parking. Expensive. Really? Really? Really?"
"2","My husband and I came here around 4 on a Saturday afternoon after spending a couple of hours at the Dog Bar. We were pretty hungry although it was not quite yet dinner time, so we just wanted something to nosh on. \n\nWe decided to go here after all the rave reviews we had from friends. We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken. We decided to split the queso and a chicken quesadilla. Our waitress (as listed per the receipt) was JWOO. She was spunky with piercings and was perfect. She was quick and even asked the kitchen to split the quesadilla between 2 plates since we were splitting (that goes a long way). \n\nThe food was excellent, although I think the queso is meant to be taken down in 5 minutes, because once it starts cooling off it can get a bit hard. \n\nOverall we had a great time and will be back, especially if going to Dog Bar."
"2","One of my favorite places to eat in CLT!  Not big fan of the complimentary salsa and chips (It's not a traditional salsa (has corn in it)).  My favorite dish on the menu is the Tavaruna (Tuna Tacos) the honey wasabi sauce (it is not hot) but the flavor is incredible) (one of best dishes."
"1","People must like fishy fish tacos, because this place gets great reviews and a cool hangout, but every time I order fish tacos, they are very fishy. The plates and utensils are usually dirty, maybe is it part of NoDa style. I didn't enjoy myself. Sorry."
"1","Can 14 years make a difference in the life of a restaurant?  At Cabo Fish Taco the answer is a resounding NO!\n\nThe last time before this week that I had a meal there was 2000.  At the end of my meal I remarked that the fish was overcooked, tasteless and served barely above room temperature.  The service was at best mediocre.\n\nAs we were in the area, a friend suggested we go there for lunch.  I hesitated for a moment, but then figured they had to get better after 14 years.  WRONG!  Someone please tell me how/why this place is still in business!\n\nWhatever that corn stuff they bring to the table is was horrible.  None of the condiments at the table could make it much better.\n\nOur waitress (in training) was pleasant enough.  She recommended a daily special - Curried Fish (trout I believe) Taco.  I had actually been in the mood for Indian food that day, so a Curried Fish Taco sounded like just the thing.  WRONG!  The curry flavor was so diluted that it tasted as though someone sprinkled just a dash of cheap curry powder on the fish while cooking.\n\nJenny's Cabo's Signature Taco (beer battered white fish) was dry, overcooked, and EXTRA crunchy.  I surely would not want my signature on that!\n\nPerhaps I will wait another 14 years to see if they are able to earn that third star...."
"2","Was just down here on vacation, and I will be going back next time I am in Charlotte. This place is just simply amazing for food. I had some shrimp tacos that I loved. The app I had was average, and the beer selection was average as well. The waitress was just above average. If they just improve a few things, this is a 5 star place, but the food enough is reason to come back!"
"1","After dinner at one night, my husband and I walked over to Nova's Bakery.  I got a piece of cake, but was horribly disappointed.  The cake was dry as if it were a few days old.  I was also disappointed with their selection of baked goods at the counter.  I expected more from a bakery that gets so much foot traffic.  They have a very limited selection."
"2","I've been here a many times now for coffee and a breakfast sandwichs. The staff is very friendly and the store has a great eclectic vibe.\n\nThe food has always been great and I didn't find it bland like some previous posters. I'm not sure what they ordered but everything I've tried has hit the spot. Even their spicy food is well done. Their pepper filled Dragon Slayer breakfast sandwich hits the spot... spicy but not so much you can't taste the rest of the ingredients.\n\nSo far I've only hung out here in the morning but heard it's a fun place to be in the evening as well."
"2","LOVE this dive bar!!  Talk about a fun, eclectic atmosphere...this is it!!!"
"2","Just to set the record straight... as of now, the pool is free every day. How could that be? The expectation is that the bar is making money because guests are drinking, and the bartenders are making money because those drinkers are tipping. If everyone comes in wanting to just play pool for free, the tables will be locked up again. So, don't spoil it for everyone! :)\n\nEB's is 21 and up. Memberships are being renewed right now. Stop in, pay your dues, pick up your new membership card, and HAVE FUN!"
"1","I was torn about leaving a negative review, as in the past I've had incredibly positive experiences with six different piercings at Sadu.  However, after thinking back on today's events I feel compelled to issue a stern warning.  Since Autumn left last fall, it seems as though the staff has been different each time I went in for work.  This in itself is not an issue, why I write is to offer you warning that your experience will likely be ruined by the inhospitable staff who excel in condescension while offering a ham-handed piercing technique.  After having both nipples pierced, a labret, an industrial, nose-ring, tongue, and ears spaced, and a multitude of other piercings, I am aware of what to expect when I decide to do further body modification.  \n\nThe staff that was working was, simply put, rude.  They were discussing disdainfully the questions that earlier clients had tendered and when they did take a break from verbally assailing these customers to help me they were short and discourteous.  Since I was there for a tragus and not to make friends I tried to dismiss this effrontery.  While the mood temporarily lightened once I went back for the piercing, the young lady with dreadlocks couldn't help but talk about herself for the entire time coming off as narcissistic and  somewhat arrogant.  Again, I soldiered on as I was terribly excited about the piercing despite the staff.  If the verbal treatment of the staff wasn't sufficient to turn me off to Sadu permanently the piercer's brutish handling lacked any semblance of finesse.   So I  would give her skills  five stars -- five stars that had each collapsed into a black hole and merged to form the largest black hole in the universe.  \n\nIf you cannot afford a professional dominatrix to mistreat you I would thoroughly recommend Sadu, if on the other hand you are looking for a positive lasting experience I would go elsewhere.\n\np.s.   to be completely fair they have great jewelry, but nothing you can't find online for the same price.  Good luck."
"1","I've been here a bunch and I want to continue supporting this place, I really do. But they make it nearly impossible. The kitchen staff works hard and the food is OK. But the wait staff is often inattentive at best and surly at worst. (Example: the host refused to seat our party at an empty table in the no-smoking section and insisted we sit adjacent to the loud, nasty bar section.)  After several such unpleasant experiences, I've given up."
"2","Really good food. My wife and I ate here today for lunch and unlike some of the other reviews got great food and service. I ordered the country fried steak with a side of chili and mashed potatoes. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings and i was impressed by both meals. Both were made in house fresh to order and came out steaming. The cook actually brought the food out and everyone seemed concerned whether we like it or not which we loved. Our waitress was awesome and never left are drinks empty. For such a good meal and getting out of there only spending 26 dollars including tip i think that this is a wonderful spot to grab a meal."
"2","Music is an integral part of my life.  If I don't go to at least 2 concerts every month I start to go through withdrawals. I'm a much bigger fan of smaller venues than massive sized arenas.  When the venue is smaller the entire concert experience is enhanced because it's more intimate and you're closer to the artist.  \n\nNeighborhood Theatre can seat a few hundred with mezzanine seating at stage right and floor seating facing the stage. The sound is great and spot on.  You can easily hear every note that is played or sung.  The only drawback is that the space is a bit dated and could use a few modern touches.  Other than the decor I think this place is awesome and will definitely be back for more concerts or events."
"1","Let me start by saying two things - I agree with the previous post about the rates and caring nature of the staff.  However, we had a less than ideal experience when using Commonwealth Animal Hospital near the end of the life of one of our kitties.\n\nAt the advice of our regular vet (a traveling vet), we took our limping kitty to get an xray done.  The xray showed an old and healed hip fracture that probably occurred when she was a feral cat (before we adopted her).  However, they didn't note the mass in her pelvis.  She did not get better...and we made a new appointment, called for results, had to call back again because the doctor did not call back.  After several rounds of phone tag and visits, we ended up at a specialist.  When it was apparent that she had cancer and was near the end of her life, CAH was very compassionate in helping us make the decision to put her to sleep.    We decided to get her cremated, and they said they would handle it and let us know when her ashes were ready to be picked up.  About 2 weeks later, we got a bill from the crematorium.  When we called them, they said the ashes had been delivered to CAH well before the bill was mailed...and they never called us.  \n\nIn sum, they were very kind and sympathetic, but disorganized.  We could have known what was going on with our kitty much sooner and settled into the notion that she was dying.  And getting the bill before the ashes was really poor form.  I doubt if we will go back."
"2","We recently transferred to Commonwealth Animal Hospital because of the horrendous service we were getting at Animal Medical. Equipped with an amazing staff, Commonwealth has done a great job at administering the shots to our two new cats. They've also done what Animal Medical failed to do multiple times (resulting in the deaths of one, maybe two, cats), and diagnosed a parasite in our kitten and successfully treated her. All of the vets we have gotten here have done a good job. \n\nAfter the loss of two cats this year, the terrific service at Commonwealth Animal Hospital has come as a welcome experience in our house. I'm positive that my family will continue to take our animals here."
"1","Never again. Waited this morning 30min and just now 40 min when originally told it would take 5 min."
"2","I'm not a big fan of Charlotte. For me it is a lonely, soulless city of finance, and as an effete intellectual from the 919 end of the state, I must be completely opposed. \n\nBut damn this is a good casual place. I was interning there a few summers ago and some Charlotte friends happened to be in town for a few days and they led me here. I had the Cincinnati chili all the way and it was tasty and kept me full the rest of the night. I was able to enjoy \""Wedding Crashers\"" without worrying about an empty stomach.\n\nBest of all, it was like $5. And there was a ton leftover. That made me wish I wasn't going to the movies afterward, as it would have made an excellent leftover meal the next day."
"2","being a professional coffeesnob.  This made me happy.  Great service, the best cap in Charlotte, and a great place to hang out.  I went to all the coffeehouses in Charlotte this won!!"
"2","Tasty French Roast coffee? Super cool and friendly staff (this time)? AND not many hipsters clogging up the inside? Man oh man this is WAY more my speed.\n\nI sat in a corner sipping my coffee (and guiltily chowing down on a cranberry muffin) and retaking in the place. Sure, the walls still had ears (and some overpriced artwork), but I actually could sit and think and write. Then about 30 minutes later, one of my friends dropped in and some of the stories she was telling I could tell the MacBook guy was listening quite intently.\n\nWhile sitting in there, I heard The Decemberists, Temper Trap, and a bunch of other Leanne-approved alternative bands. Definitely an improvement of last time too.\n\nThank you Smelly Cat for a pleasant experience, I'll be back!\n\n(oh yeah, and Props for the Yelp sign at the counter AND the one on the door!)"
"2","Entered Smelly Cat for the second time in my life the other day (first visit was a group meeting back when I was getting my MBA, and I'm trying to block that craziness from my mind, so this review is only for my most recent visit). \n\nWhat a wonderful little coffee shop. If I lived in NoDa, I would definitely support this small business instead of hitting up the big chains. The atmosphere is quite cool and laid back, and the staff was beyond wonderful. They had a ton of pastries and what looked like a mouth watering carrot cake, but I was there for one reason, and one reason only...caffeine.\n\nNicole W (being the fantastic community manager that she is) raved to me about the pour over coffee, so at Yelp's Passport to NoDa event earlier this week, I hightailed it over there to check it out. The wonderful Cathy (what a great name, huh?) walked us through the process of pour over coffee, which creates a very smooth cup o' joe. I thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and my caffeine - with some steamed almond milk and honey. Very, very good. If you have the time to wait, I highly recommend checking it out. \n\nAnd to support the business even further, I purchased a nice little pullover. There are t-shirts, sweatshirts, and other items for sale with the logo and location on them. I love me some quirky little gear. \n\nHead on in to Smelly Cat and sit inside if the weather isn't good, or grab one of the outdoor tables and soak up some vitamin D. Either way, you can feel good about supporting a small business in your area."
"2","A Charlotte classic!  Not for the feint of heart or those on a diet.  This is your standard greasy spoon dive.  Great burgers, fried pickles, and other assorted grub.  Was spotlighted on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives a couple of years back."
"1","I am a big fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives... so I thought I would really enjoy the Penguin. Sadly, on each occasion that I have eaten there, I have been very disappointed. I have tried their black bean  burgers which I normally love but found theirs lacking. I also did not care for their vegetarian chili and found nothing special about their sides either. Personally, if I want good fried food, I prefer either the Bar-b-que King on WIlkinson Blvd or The Clock on South Blvd!\n2011 Update: NOW CLOSED"
"2","Just one of those good ole fashion drive-in style places. Tons of history behind the establishment in a trendy area. Atmosphere was great and the deep fried pickles were bangin'. I would highly recommend a dose of The Penguin"
"2","OK, let's be clear here, The Penguin is NOT closed. It is reopening in January 2011, that's been established by the family that has actually owned this awesome place for over 50 years. I can't wait to get in there an harden my arteries once again! Great burgers, fried pickles, cheap beer!!"
"1","The original Penguin closed its doors on 10/24.  Now, different people run it. If you're looking for the food and atmosphere that you found before October 2010, you'll have to look elsewhere.  The wait staff wear uniforms, the menu is trademarked, and they didn't even make this stuff in the first place.  The pickles are much worse, and the burgers just don't cut it.  They also got rid of some staples too.  Hit Pinky's or the Diamond for remnants of the real Penguin.  The Penguin may have the same name, but it's as different as if a Burger King closed and a McDonald's opened in its place."
"1","this place has been Charlotted. that means a place was once cool and now the soul has been sucked out of it."
"1","The people who made the penguin what it is were pushed out by the late property owners greedy ass daughter. WILL NEVER SPEND A DIME HERE"
"1","Don't be fooled, this place is nothing special! Had a BBQ sand and was nothing but disappointed. Why would anyone go out other their was to do a fried pickle? The sweet potato fries were nearly uneatable, once you got past the greasy exterior I think there was a sweet potato interior."
"1","This was our first visit since the ownership has changed.  No longer \""THE Penguin\""... the fried pickles that used to be epic are now overly fried and not as juicy and tangy.  Overall, food was just not the same and grease abounds.  We were shocked that we were literally the only people eating dinner there since we've never been in a situation that we didn't have to wait for a table, but then after the new versions of the food... I unfortunately understand why.  What a bummer."
"1","Well here I am doing an update a couple years later on the good ol' penguin. There was a rapid decline of this burger joint once new management took over. The original chef left and with that he took the delicious tasting burgers and fried pickles with him! There is nothing great about this place any longer and I have complained to the manager at least once about how the prices went up and the quality of the food went down. They never had anything to say about it, just \""Im sorry you feel that way\"" maybe they should get a clue before they go bankrupt. I refuse to go there anymore and that is a great loss for me, since this place was my number one choice for a tasty burger."
"1","I first went to the Penguin in 2008 and it was awesome.  Hip vibe, crowded, cold beer, and delicious food.  Alas, time has not been kind to the penguin.  I have tried it several times since then when I found myself in downtown Charlotte and it has gotten progressively worse each time.\n\nThe food is still good - how can you go wrong with pimento cheese?  However, the servers are clueless, the service slow, the menu is smaller, the beer selection is limited, the kitchen is slower.  It is sad because the neighborhood has finally caught up with the coolness of what the Penguin used to be.  Do yourself a favor and try one of the many new restaurants that have opened while the Penguin was resting on its TV appearances.  Going to the Penguin will just leave you disappointed."
"1","This is the WORST MCDONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!!! The staff is rude and the order is never right. How hard is it to make a mcdouble without onions and mustard. Every time I come here my order is never right and I have to go back..."
"2","Good food and great prices.  Can't beat $5 shock top pitchers.  Pimento cheese sandwich is awesome and can't go wrong with the burgers...big block southern style!"
"2","I just moved back to Charlotte last month & wanted to hit up an old haunt of mine- the Penguin.  Now, I know what everyone is thinking & yes, I was that clueless.  Thank goodness there was a couple walking down the street as I was getting out of the car that caught me up to speed on everything.  So, my son & I headed around the block to the Diamond and BOY are we glad we did!  \nI love the new menu which managed to incorporate all the old favorites- sweet potato fries, fried pickles, $5 pitchers of beer- along with an expanded selection (especially for vegetarians).  The first time we visited, my son got a corn dog & I got the meatless meatloaf & omg, you HAVE to put this in your mouth!!  Delicious!  Even the five year old ate a few forkfuls.  The two of us also spit an order of gravy fries (there were a ton of leftovers, too).\nI went back a few weeks later with a girlfriend & we were feeling a need to indulge in bar food.  Ended up ordering both gravy fries & sweet potato fries, a regular hot dog & a jumbo soy dog.  They were just what we were wanting!!  Along with the fact that our eyes were larger than our stomachs, the large portion sizes assured us that we left with two boxes of leftovers!"
"1","I've gone to the Diamond an many occasions, and it has always been spotty.  One visit terrible, one visit pretty good, but never great.  After my visit this past weekend, I guess I'm calling it quits.  The bottom line is that it's not worth going to a place when the odds are the service and food will sorely disappoint.  \n\nWe had two people visiting from out of town, and forgot Dish was closed, so we figured \""hey, the Diamond wasn't too bad last time, let's go there.\""  Luckily, there was no wait, the four of us sat down, asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials.  Two of us then ordered the black bean burger.  They were out of that too.  We got some other stuff, and a starter of fried pickles, which were okay.  My friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh, because she was thinking about a BLT.  The waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive,  \""yes.\""  Then we waited and waited for the food.  It took way too long to come out.\n\nWe finally got our dishes.  I was okay with mine, but everyone else was very disappointed.  It was as if Diamond shops for the absolute bottom-rung ingredients.    If you put a salad on a menu, it should be at least somewhat appetizing.  The small block burger was a sad, ugly  thing.  The tomatoes were hard and without much flavor.  One person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as \""disgusting.\""  I was embarrassed to have brought friends there.\n\nThe take-away lesson here is that it's great to be a local institution.  It's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele.  But if you're a restaurant, it's still all about the food for most of your patrons.  You need to have quality food.  And don't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner.  Especially when you're charging $9 or more for some plates.  A lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price.\n\nSo the Diamond is still a great place to get a drink, but they've got to overhaul nearly everything when it comes to their food."
"1","What a disappointment. Mediocre, overpriced food. The pimento cheese \""sandwich\"" is about a nickel's worth of cheese on two overly dry, overtoasted pieces of bread. The chicken and dumplings was a small watery bowl of dry chicken and, again, about a nickel's worth of dumplings. The hummus and pita was fine. The kids mac and cheese was average. The bill? Nearly 40 bucks, which is about twice as much as it should have been. This is the kind of overrated place that everyone is supposed to love because of its retro hipster vibe. But the food is better at Waffle House."
"1","I went with my wife for lunch we were curious since we use to go to Penguin, and was a little disappointed the food was bland and the service was just o.k."
"1","I really, really want to like The Diamond. It's cheap, convenient to my house, and my friends like it. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times. \n\nMy friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right. \n\nThe $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh."
"2","Throwback Diner - good atmosphere, food, staff - had the 1/4 chicken BBQ dipped with Mac n cheese + homemade chips and 1/3 lb beef burger - all very tasty! Will go back again."
"2","Food was pretty darn good. Good portions for a good price. Inside decor and menu is adorable. Booth backs are uncomfortable if there is someone sitting behind you. It then turns into a battle to see who will end up hunched over with a back ache. Service was definitely a little lacking. We came in two hours before closing and our waitress' closing duties took precedence over our service. I would get that if we were there thirty minutes before closing, but we weren't."
"2","For stars for a great back patio! other than that it's a bar, and a big one. But yea, don't bother staying inside. Nothing wrong with the inside but it's like so many other bars out there. The patio on the other hand is special and worth your business."
"2","Great beer selection good food fried okra is awesome.  Good local bar lots of character. Ping pong and cornhole in the outdoor patio."
"2","Good greasy spoon.  Quick and Cheap breakfast even on the weekends.  Don't expect anything fancy, but for the price and the fact that it's walking distance, it's hard to beat."
"1","What did the mop say to the floor?  Nothin'...  They've never met.  I dont think I have ever eaten in a dirtier establishment.  I'm not talking about a day old mess more like months of dirt on the dining area floor...  Balled up napkins and old french fries.\n\nBut I did stay and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  $7.10 with water...  The sandwich was good but nothing spectactular.  The fries were fresh and hot.  If I go back it will be for breakfast most likely."
"2","Jock Strap Central!!!  Hey Man, where else are you going to find \""Nasty Pig\"" brand apparel (really I had never heard of it)!  Now I have!\n\nJock Straps on Central!

"1","My wife and I just stopped at the Dairy Queen on central on our way home. I got the pumpkin pie blizzard. I was giddy like a school girl. There were tiny hairs all over my entire blizzard. It was repulsive. I will never go there again, and this is depressing, because Dairy Queen in Philly was a high school hang out for me."
"1","A diner should be able to consitently make your eggs the right way,  this place just cant seem to get it right,  ITS CALLED over medium people its not that hard.  I rather frequent Liberty east or the Big view"
"2","This is a family restaurant and has pretty much everything on the menu and some Greek goodies as well. I had their special pork tips with rice. It was definitely YUM!! The portion was huge. The seating area is clean and our server was quite pleasant."
"2","HUGE menu. The fries are the only thing I don't care for. Service tonight was great."
"2","Greek Family ran love it. The Turkey and stuffing is full of flavor. The menu is large very large but you will find some thing for you. And the spinach bite dinner just eat it."
"1","I asked a young male waiter on saturday am 07/14 to have home fries lightly browned, they came to table well done, decided to overlook this. Then before finishing my plate and cofffee, I had to use the restroom, when I came back to my table a lady was clearing the table and rmoving all that was left! I used to be a regular but now I will eat somewhere else!"
"1","After years of wanting to check this place out, I finally headed down Central Ave. I arrived at 11:15 and the placed was packed. I joined those waiting and watched as the disarray of settings took place. After being seated, I waited, at my dirty table, over 10 minutes before even being approached. I ordered the Sunday Turkey, Gravy, and Stuffing Special, with mashed potatoes and corn as the sides. I was offered bread and said yes. The bread was stale and cold. As I waited over 20 minutes I admired the dirty floors and rude servers. My dish was finally delivered and looked like a mound of gravy, and was cold. I asked to have it reheated and was given a not-so-friendly look. Once I was able to dive in the stuffing had no flavor and was so soggy. The turkey was okay, but destroyed with the \""out of the can\"" yellow gravy. The mashed potatoes and corn were okay, but I can imagine the corn was frozen. Definitely disappointed and will not return."
"2","One of Charlotte's best DIners. I've lived in NY and Chicago and have been to many and this compares. Brings back memories every time I dine here."
"2","The very best Turkey and Dressing I have Ever had (sorry, Mom!). The turkey was tender and moist, and along with the delicious stuffing and gravy, practically melted in my mouth.  I love that they're open so late! The wait staff were very attentive and helpful.  Huge menu, beautiful house-made desserts.  I look forward to eating there again next time I'm in Charlotte."
"1","After few times finding instant noodles, and some frozen products are a year or so past due date, I stopped going although they are just mile away from my house.  Just make sure you check the date on the package."
"2","Finally found the time to check this place out after hearing many good things about it.  Upon first glance, I wanted to get back in my car and speed away.  Interior is pretty basic and bare bone but the food!!!!!!  *JESUS*  Was amazing!  I love the amount of vegetables that came with the pho, great service, and a great price.  Might take the #1 spot on my pho spots in Charlotte list!"
"1","O M G. I need to update this one fur-shure. It had been a few month's since having something from here. What the heck happened? \n\nI soooooo *proudly* wrote the very first review for this place and have been recommending them since. I too went the first time based on a recommendation. NOT anymore due to our last takeout order. \nTo be nice: It. Was. Bad. \n\nFour of us placed an order. The chicken enchiladas were diced up pieces of dried out chicken, rolled up in dried out tortillas, with a thick glob of cheap ass cheese, covered with the salsa rojo(so the menu says) which in reality, was canned hunts tomato sauce with some black pepper tossed in for good measure.Seriously, it was so obvious when I opened the container and \""that canned sauce smell\"" slapped me in the face. My friend who ordered the very same thing, claims to have been slapped twice. \n\nThe beef fajitas were a takeout dish full of peppers and onions (where's da beef ? Oh there it is, pointing to about four slivers hiding under the P&O's ) we asked for corn tortillas and searching through the takeout for them I said \""Oh who ordered papusas\"" NO ONE did! Those things, that were as thick as a papusas, were the corn tortillas for the fajitas. No thank you. \n\nGood thing we ordered back up tacos. They're always good. \nWRONG. Again, back to the *dried out * theme. Where's the garbage?\n\nEven the salsas, green and the red, WAYYYY off. \nI know places have their \""OFF NIGHTS \"" but damn. \n\nOne thing that has not changed, unfortunately, is the use of little plastic baggies for the condiments on the takeout orders."
"1","I am a salvadoran-american so I know good salvadoran food when I see it...\nhowever this place just does not meet my standards for good salvadoran food in fact i spent my after-noon throwing up after visiting this place..... I could never get desperate enough for salvadoran food to come here No,no,no .... Pupusas from here are EXTREMELY OILY just not appetizing at all ... The yuca frita was also disgusting OILY FOOD FOLKS DON'T COME HERE"
"2","First off, this whole review is based off To-Go, so I just wanted to note this.....\n\nI grew up in New York and just moved to Charlotte from just outside New York City....basically Italian Central!  I have ate a ton of great Italian food and am Italian myself.\n\nWhen I walked into Portofino, I felt like I was back in Westchester!  Slices on the counter, garlic knots....all of the good stuff.\n\nI have not had the pizza, but have tried a few dinners.  The stuffed shells were awesome, and included a huge portion!  The chicken Parm was great, and again huge portion.  All meals are served with a salad (delicous homemade \""house\"" dressing and a full small loaf of freshly baked bread.\n\nThis place is in a somewhat sketch plaza on Eastway.....it's kinda weird that it's there, but that doesn't really matter!  It is my new \""Go to\"" Italian spot when I want a taste of home."
"2","Perfect pizza!  Found this place on Yelp on the way out of the Charlotte Airport. It looked so good I actually turned around and back-tracked a few miles. So glad that I did!  Friendly staff and great food!  Real Italian food - from a guy who grew up in Jersey b"
"2","I love this place. Relatively small simple menu with around 5-8 constantly changing specials. Always very high quality food that tastes great. Has that small neighborhood place feel. One of my favorite places in Charlotte to eat. If I had to come up with one negative thing, the parking situation could be better."
"1","If you're at the hospital and want something other than hospital food, this place may be the ticket.  Right across the street, you can get a good variety of food.  It's quick and easy and not too expensive.  Just don't go for the atmosphere because, well, there isn't much.  But keep your head down and that won't matter much."
"2","Especially love just do it!  Same Time Next Year was fabulous."
"1","No no.. Boston Market ? HUH    go back to Boston with your nasty food and prices give me a break 1 piece of chicken 2 spoons  of veg 10 bucks?When I saw 3 Cops eating for free?I know it happens all the time I guess its the \"" if we give them free food we will get more protection?\"" with plate fulls of Food and by the way they did not need it . I will pay anything but when the food is nasty .. I swear I was praying to the toilet God all night after eating here.. Never again   .Its a great idea.. If the food was not so terrible . \n\nPS   there maybe locations that actually have food that you can eat but,, the few Charlotte NC location are terrible  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK"
"1","My husband and I had dinner at Providence Cafe on a Wednesday evening at 7:30, the place was not very busy and we easily were one of the last tables there when we left at 8:45. The food was ok - good but the service was terrible. This was a celebratory dinner and we usually take our time at dinner but we were unfortunately rushed thru the entire meal, and I couldn't understand why...since there wasn't by any means a lack of tables. We had no time to enjoy our wine before our salads arrived and I wasn't even half way done with my salad by the time the entree appeared. My husband had to get up to get our own fresh ground pepper. And our water glasses were never filled so I finally asked for more water and Emily the waitress only filled my glass, even though my husband's glass was empty and was right next to mine. Never smiled, didn't know how to describe the restaurant she works at. Since this was both of our first times dining here we asked her (as a test to get her talking), \""What kind of restaurant would you describe this place as?\"" Her reply, \""I don't know, good question.\"" I believe PC has been around for quite some time but if they want to keep their tables full they better start hiring a bit better. On a good note, the 2 man band that was playing was excellent. The salads weren't worth ordering for $6 but the Flounder entree and shrimp and grits were pretty good but unfortunately I probably won't come back because of the service, or the lack there of."
"1","I just want to get rid of my Acne scars, but he prescribed me with a very strong medicine with very strong side effects even he knows I can't take it. I felt really sick. Then he gave me another facial gel, I just used it twice and got serious allergy for days with affects my work too. Then he prescribed me with another liquid which contains alcohol to cure the allergy, which make my face even burned more!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to use iced milk to cure myself now. If you are pretty and don't want to become ugly, then never go to Charles Brown's office!!"
"2","The girl behind the desk was so sweet and helpful. I have thick, curly, dry hair, and I am picky about my layers. The stylist she put me with was amazing, and so were the products. I am never going back to Aveda again!!!! I highly recommend this place!! Well worth the money if you want a GOOD haircut."
"1","I will never go back to this Rite Aid! I had a problem with a very expensive product there and the staff was very rude to me. The assistant manager spoke down to me and treated me like I was stupid. She did nothing to help me or the situation. It was so bad I left in tears and will never go back."
"1","Service is AWEFUL due to management not scheduling enough servers. The ONLY reason I'm giving this 2 stars is for the pizza and servers who had to step up due to our original server's incompetence. There was a female bartender with glasses who was extremely rude. Might come back I when it's not so busy."
"2","The food here is good, but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Everything was was good quality and well prepared (and fast!) and the price was very reasonable. My wife and I both ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (white) which came with cornbread and two sides. I got the baked beans and the special: spicy mac & cheese. The first thing I tried was the cornbread, and found it had jalape\u00f1os and whole kernels of corn baked in. I know some people really like the whole corn in the cornbread thing, but I'd rather keep my breads and vegetables separate. Next up was the spicy mac & cheese. I love mac & cheese, and I've become a big fan of having a bit of hot sauce added to give it some kick, so I was really excited about this. It certainly had the spicy; it had lots of jalape\u00f1os mixed in and was quite hot. What it was lacking was the cheese. There was no creaminess to it at all. The baked beans, however, were very good. They also had jalape\u00f1os mixed in (are you sensing a theme here?), but only had a subtle kick which was balanced with a slightly sweet tangy sauce. As for the chicken, the flavor was excellent but most of the breast was pretty dry. The wing, on the other hand, was quite juicy. If you're looking for really moist chicken you might have better luck with the dark meat. There were no jalape\u00f1os in the chicken."
"2","If you are thinking of a place for lunch and dinner, Skyland wouldn't be my top choice, or my second choice. Their food is decent, I won't say it's good or bad, just decent. It is by far the best place open past 11pm though. Their breakfast is pretty good I will say, and they serve it 24/7. It's very affordable with most items about 5 - 9 dollars. \n\nBreakfast 4/5 stars\nLunch/Dinner 2/5 stars\nAfterhours Dining 5/5 stars"
"1","This would be the the kind of place I would normally like and, therefore, I have tried it several times.  The service was good and the people were friendly, but I found the vegetables to have an odd chemical taste to them.  Maybe it's just my taste buds, but the other reviewers seem to like it."
"2","I am a fan of diners.  Skyland is one of the many Greek-owned restaurants in town, but one of the very few (if any at all) that opens on Christmas Day.  It's a 24-hour spot mostly (I think it's closed Sunday late night through Monday morning).  I used to come here during the wee early morning hours after a night of partying like a rockstar.  Lately I've been here more for their dinner blue plates.  \n\nThe food here is typical home-cooking.  Fried livers have enough to be shared (don't ewww me!).  Cabbage rolls are good, but it's only on Fridays (or is it Saturdays?).  I personally don't care for their mac & cheese (it's dry and not too flavorful). Cabbage & oven potatoes are my favorites.  Fried apple sticks as a side can be consumed as a dessert :)  The best part of eating dinner here is the complimentary cup of soup.  I'm a soup addict.  The weirdest thing here is their YELLOW gravy, I swear it glows!  I was a bit taken back by it, but I needed gravy for my turkey & dressing last night, so I hope I am not turning any yellow-er today (lol, Asian joke).  And to be fair, the ladies that work here aren't rude all the time.  In fact mostly they're very southern diner nice.\n\nI give them 4-stars because it's a reliable & affordable place to eat.  They don't care if you sit there all night (and I have, studying)."
"1","What can I say? This was one of a very few places opened late-late in the QC, so it gets the job done. The portions are large, yet the flavor is just ok. The service was pretty decent as well as the prices. May go back in the future, but it will not be number one on my list of options. I know Charlotte is no DC or NYC, but we really could use more variety for late night dining."
"1","I will first say we only ordered pizza and have never come in for a full dinner so perhaps this is unfair to review but this was my experience. Very friendly and cute little restaurant and the menu looked pretty good from what I saw online, but we only wanted a pie to go. I gotta say, we were disappointed. I was skeptical about brick oven because generally speaking the best pizza does not come out of a brick oven. We have tried most of the local pizza joints and have not had good luck of late and we try our best to stay away from the national chains. I wanted to like the pizza, but it just wasn't very good. The crust was so thin it was soggy everywhere but the edges. The edge crust was tasty and that was the highlight, which ironically is usually the least enjoyable part of a pizza. Since the crust was so thin and soggy in the middle, it did not fill us up and it could not support much sauce or toppings either. Pizza is supposed to have a thin crust, but that doesn't mean it should be so thin that its soggy and without structure enough to hold a tasty sauce, cheese and toppings. I've lived in different parts of Charlotte and for some reason all the good places are up on the northern side of town. I guess we'll have to start driving a little further for it. I give up on any place south of Harris Blvd."
"1","Was excited to come here. Brought kids. Awful service. Nasty. Got sick. Do not recommend."
"1","What is wrong with you people.  how hard is it to give a quote for a part and to replace it.  even a doctor can give a price for a flu shot.  if thats too difficult to accommodate maybe be they should be repairing cars.  the other shop was able to give me a quote for my pump and labor for my mercedes with no problem and he didn't even ask me to bring it in.  maybe the rest of you guys have time to need an education on being a smart shopper.  and larry what an ignorant fool insulting someone for his own experience."
"1","Local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear. The selection for rock climbing gear was very limited. The store was clean and well organized. Prices were on par with MSRP. So, why two stars? Well, I don't particularly care for being followed around by employees as I peruse the store. I'll take my business elsewhere."
"2","My 400th review!\n\nWhere I'm not the biggest fan of getting in and out of this shopping center, I'm a fan of quite a few of the businesses found here. This place opened up in the 50's and was a hot ticket for shopping...and still is(?). Come here on the regular and a few of my favorites are:\n\nPark Place Theatre\nCarolina Soda Shoppe\nGreat Outdoor Provision (sometimes)\nBlackhawk Hardware (free popcorn!)\nThe Flying Biscuit\n\nIt's a great place to shop. Getting out of here onto Woodlawn is a little tough. Beware of long lines of cars."
"1","I took my daughter here and it was a very bad experience. The two men were very opinionated about their conservative politics and imposed their views on us, plus the haircut was bad."
"1","Short wait, and they did change my oil, so that was good.  But I won't go here again and this is why: They \""inflated\"" all my tires to 34 psi, even though they are rated for a higher pressure, and were in fact inflated to the proper, fuel saving pressure before the oil change.  By the time the guy came in the waiting room and told me that they had inflated all my tires to 34 psi, they had already rolled my car out, so it was too late.\n\nOn top of all that, they're not cheap, and they do that annoying thing where they try to sell you new air filters, trans service, yadda yadda yadda."
"2","Fast quick service! My first time here took down my name address and asked if I wanted to use conventional oil or something else. Waiting room was please and clean, weren't too pushy with the filters and other stuff they try to sell you. They also vacuum out your interior and wash your window which is always a plus , overall good service I will continue to come here if I'm in the area."
"1","I hate giving just average reviews, but I think this really was a 2 star experience.  \n\nOur server was awful.  She was nice but, sorry, pretty dumb.  The soup of the day was minestrone and she said \""Don't even ask me what's in it, cause I have no idea.\""  Really??  I think she was trying to be funny, but it was odd.  Would you ever say that as a server?  And don't most people know what's in minestrone anyway?  \n\nSo then we ordered our meals.  I got the sirloin and my husband the ribeye.  The steaks came and were put in front of us.  I was pretty sure they were switched so I asked the server.  She said \""No, I know this cause of the fat line right here, that means it's a sirloin.\""  REALLY?!?!  Anyone who knows anything about steak knows that sirloin is pretty lean and ribeye is very fatty.  I couldn't believe it.  I also thought I tasted some Old Bay on my steak.  No thanks, I like just salt and pepper.  I was very unimpressed with the salad too.  Iceberg doesn't do it for me.  \n\nOn the good side, the hostess and I'm guessing the manager were very nice.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be back :("
"1","Over rated.Drinks and Food are over price."
"1","We have been to the Beef and Bottle several times in the past and always had a good experience.  The food has always been good and the service as well.  Unfortunately, I recently had a very unsettling phone conversation with the manager as I was trying to set up a reservation.  4 couples bought a Living Social with the hopes of having a nice dinner together.  It says in the fine print of the coupon that you can only use one per table.  I was hoping that we might be granted an exception, especially when I explained that it would be the same for them either way - we would come and sit at 4 separate tables and use 4 vouchers OR they could just let us sit together.  Alas, no exception and a very rude manager as I tried to explain how they were not going to be out any more money.  Oh well . . . . . . One of our favorites just became NOT one of our favorites . . . . . . It's not so much that I didn't get the answer I wanted, it was the way I was treated on the phone - definitely not professional and quite rude."
"2","Life is funny and ironic sometimes. When I was a wee teen ravaging the streets of Southern California, I always had this notion old people were odd and boring. They had weird hobbies like radio controlled planes and had very different perspectives on life.\n\n16 years later and here I am, an adult male who has kinda matured and now perusing different hobbies and interests. \n\nDifferent things like home aquariums. I mean, WTH, Fish? How can boring ole fish be so gratifying?  I turned into the dudes I used to make fun of.\n\nOh well. \n\nSo hello Fintastic, Charlotte's premier aquatic HQ. They stock supplies for all environments: Ponds, salt, fresh, brackish.\n\nLots of fish. Saltwater, freshwater, skrimps, snails, frogs. They have it all. They even have a shark you can feed on Sundays and I even saw an Alligator Gar in the pond for sale!"
"1","It's a burger king, so I won't say much about the food. It was just what you would expect out of a Burger King. \n\nI don't normally review  fast food places, but people should know that something is off at this Burger King. \n\nOkay, first of all, I walked in, and went to use the restroom after several hours on the road. Well. An employee made the very odd decision to prop the door open. While I was \""mid-flow.\"" It's hard for men to stop urinating when they start, especially if they have to go really bad. So, I was standing there, whizzing away and, just to repeat, the employee came and propped the door open. Why would they do such a thing? Let's just throw privacy out the window. \n\nMaking matters worse, a little girl was confused by the open door, and must have assumed it was the little girl's room, and walked in for a second. So, great, having my genitals out in the presence of a child. Just lovely. I growled/shouted \""Wrong Bathroom\"" at the kid, and seemingly terrified,  she ran away, and fell on her butt on the way out. \n\nEven worse, as I was washing my hands I heard her mom start screaming at her for the mistake. \n\nI was a little shaken at this point, and sort of stumbled up to the ordering counter to get my spicy chicken sandwich. Nobody was serving me, as I stood there trying to not look annoyed, and then the little girl with her mom walked to the other register, and were promptly served by a dwarf working at the other counter. \n\nLook, I'm glad that Burger King is cool with employing Dwarves, I'm sure it's not easy for \""little people\"" to find gainful employment. But come on lady, I wasn't trying to insult you when I stood at the wrong counter, I just couldn't see you. \n\nWhen I adjusted to her cash register (heaven forbid she come to my register or alert me to her presence), the cashier was kind of unpleasant. I hope nobody spit on my food. \n\nOh yeah, the Spicy chicken sandwich was fine, it tasted the same way it would at any other burger king."
"1","Tried this place several times on the chance the first time I went they were just having an off night? I was wrong..The bartender and the server were rude...and the prices sky high..both times left me with a bad taste in my mouth..enough said..don't waste your time"
"1","Mediocre food, average atmosphere...it did not live up to the billing it had been given by a friend."
"2","Portofino serves up delicious Italian food and has an extensive menu, with pasta, meat dishes, pizza and subs. I've been there for dinner a couple times and tried the lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs. I'd recommend both dishes. The servings are pretty large so chances are you'll have leftovers to take home. The warm garlic bread is also a plus, as is the long wine menu. The restaurant has a cute intimate decor and the service is friendly. It's a good dinner spot for a romantic date."
"2","Best home cooked Italian joint in NC so far.  Their special was awesome!  I wanted to get the Shrimp Scampi, but they had a special with shrimp and scallops and I couldn't so no.  Glad I didn't.  Absolutely the best thing ever.  Give this place a  try!"
"2","If you've tired of the standard mall toy store fare, Bedford Falls may be for you.  They aren't exactly a learning store, where you'll find stuff that kids don't like - they actually have things that kids can enjoy as well, but they can enjoy in the process: Things like volcanos, build-your own slime kits and even potato guns.\n\nYou can of course find Thomas toys, army men, stuffed animals, books and all manner of kids toys as well, and the staff is first-rate at helping you find what you might need."
"2","My husband and I really like this tattoo shop. Derek was our tattoo artist. He had me convinced this was where I would want to get a tattoo because he sketches all his work. All my tattoos are unique and have always been sketched from an artist off the top of their head. I prefer to have a tattoo that nobody else will have (it might be similar but never my exact tattoo, unlike people who chooses a tattoo from the wall or the set of pics in other shops). Derek made me feel comfortable. He was friendly, funny and informative. We will definitely go back for another tattoo. This shop does piercing as well and have plenty of body jewelry to choose from. As far as parking, there is parking in the back and the walk to the door isn't far at all."
"2","This place is awesome.  Moved to CLT in desperate need of Korean food/people.  I got hooked up here with both.  Owner is very friendly and I can find everything that I'm looking for here.  My mom is back in California, but the owner told me to call her Mom... =)\n\ndmo out"
"2","You can usually find a line coming out of this place during weekday lunches and breakfast. I was lucky enough that this morning there wasn't.  I got my chicken minis hot and fresh. My only complaint as always is why don't they serve chicken minis all day?"
"2","I usually meet my friends here for lunch as it is a good midpoint between uptown and South Charlotte. Parking can be a little tricky for this area, but I've always found a spot, somewhere close.\n\nThe line inside is always pretty quick, and there are an abundance of children during lunch time, as there is a pretty good play place attached. If you don't like children, I suggest going somewhere else. \n\nThe servers are nice and the food is good, what I've come to expect from a Chick Fil A, and have never been disappointed here."
"2","Awesome burger!    The place looks so great since the renovation!  Great dessert that's new!  Macadamia brownie with gooey Carmel.   And ice cream!   Meatloaf is a great entree as well!  Great staff and awesome head chef!"
"1","I will not be returning as a client due to an extremely rude female doctor that attempted to reprimand me for questioning the services rendered as well as the amount of the bill. It is our right as a client to ask questions about what we are paying for as well as question the care for our animals, and as a business it is their job to make the clients feel comfortable enough to do so. They did the very opposite and unfortunately most of my prior visits there have been met with rude cold customer service. If they can't provide their human clients with respect and kindness when we are the ones footing the bill \nit is unnerving to think how they treat the animals when they are in their care."
"2","Let's just start by saying - This place ROCKS!\n\nAs I have done in the past I use Yelp, and the Open Table Reservations to make the weekends more enjoyable by placing reservations online more than a week in advance. \n\nOur reservations were for 7:15pm and we were promptly seated at 7:15pm.  Our servers name was Ann Marie and she was fantastic.  She provided a few good suggestions for the meals and was very quick to keep our glasses full.\n\nI had the Chicken Marsala w/ wild rice and vegetables (I have added a picture), and my wife had the Petite Filet.  Her meal was fantastic as I was able to swipe a piece or two of her steak.  It was perfectly cooked and was very tender.  Kudos to the chef. Mine was even better than the photo.  The chicken was tender, the marsala sauce was perfect, and had just the right blend of mushrooms to bring out the delightful flavors and it even smelled as wonderful.\n\nThis is definitely on the short list as it was very solid in its food,the staff, and the service.\n\nOh heck, I only gave it four stars, but believe me, it may be worthy of the 5th.\n\nI will be back.......and I am hoping it will be as wonderful.\n\nI would strongly recommend this place. If you have heard of this place and can't find it, it is because it is behind the Fresh Market off of Providence Road and has only one road into its location, it is not like you will just stumble upon it, you must search it out.\n\nRemember to mention Yelp, and you get 10% off your bill.\n\nNCFoodGuy"
"2","As the only upper end shopping center in Charlotte, SouthPark Mall garners 4 stars, since there is nothing else to compare it to, however, it is no different that any typical mall in a larger city with higher end retailers.  \n\nThe usual offerings that have now become so commonplace in subburban settings, such as Louis Vuitton, Nordstrom, Ralph Lauren, Aveda and the like are represented in this well kept shopping center, but if you are visiting from a larger city, you might find it to be on the smallish scale."
"2","This is one of my favorite malls, period.  Don't let the presence of Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom throw you; there is plenty here for the budget minded as well as the high end customer.  Every major category of merchandise is represented here, save for major appliances, and there are already plenty of places to get those anyway.\n\nMy favorite stores for bargains are the seemingly least likely places to look.  I love going to SouthPark and checking the sale racks at Belk (it's a four level showplace with everything you can think of; it puts my local Belk stores to shame) Dillard's, Nordstrom, Sur la Table (kitchen wares, pronounced sur la tab), The Art of Shaving (men's grooming products), Crate & Barrel and any number of other upscale stores that have \""killer\"" sales and clearances.  \n\nIf all else fails, you can eat. This mall boasts a major food court along with several sit-down restaurants and in-store restaurants at Nordstrom and Belk."
"2","Went here a few weeks ago for my yearly (happened last 3 years ago...ha) skin scan. Large comfortable waiting area with TV's, though didn't wait long. Had a lot of questions and the Doctor was very helpful. Thorough and informative. Nurses followed up sooner than expected on the results. Place is a little tricky to find. If you're using mapquest or the map app, it's a little off, so make sure you go through the Firefighter Rd. intersection (coming from Uptown area) and take the next right into the complex...2630 building is all the way in the back."
"2","I absolutely loved this place. It is full of eclectic items, all of which are hand crafted by artisans all over the world. The buyers for this store travel abroad to support these artists, and everything in the store is fair trade. Extra points for the fact that the company is not-for-profit. \n\nHere you will find lots of woven baskets, items made out of carved wood and stone, jewelry, candles, CD's, and other miscellaneous items that are totally unique and exquisite. This is kind of place that you'd want to spend a while browsing, taking it all in, even though it's not a huge space. You can listen to the Putomayo CD playing while you browse, and you could even make a purchase of one of the mixes. The women who work here are extrememly friendly and knowledgeable of the products being sold, and ever so willing to help. Check out the pics I've attached - lots of cool things!"
"1","Don't get alterations done once you purchase the suit! We purchased 12 suits for our bridal party and when my fianc\u00e9 went to pick his up from getting the pants hemmed, he found that they had simply folded almost 6 inches of fabric up underneath the pant leg which made them bulky and heavy. When he complained they agreed that it was not done properly and he waited while they fixed it, only to find that there were now large holes in the fabric that you could see from a distance. We had to get another pair of pants and definitely took them somewhere else for alterations. Also, when we picked up the suit it wasn't pressed at all, it simply looked like it had been lying in the corner on the floor. \n\nTerrible service, attitude and quality...I now see why they have to offer SO many sales for their stores."
"1","I had gone and checked out an apartment here about a month ago. I looked at a one/one and was not impressed. For the quoted cost ($800 plus trash and basic cable), the actually size of the place wasn't so bad (I believe it was 750sq ft), but it smelled like mildew as you walked up the stairs and into the apartment. Plus the appliances and cabinets were outdated and grungy. It didn't seem worth the money. Not to mention there were pipelines and exposed wires in the bedroom closet. I settled on a beautiful 2/2 with patio and fireplace somewhere else for the same cost as Camden's 1/1."
"2","I love J Crew & wish I could afford their prices.  I especially adore the men's clothing offerings for my boyfriend. \n\nThe store is clean, neat & well organized.  But beware; pretty much at any time they are always busy, which means you may have to wait in line a while to make your purchase.\n\nPrices are a bit steep & they rarely have any huge sales.  The employees are \""so-so\"" - to me they aren't overly friendly, but not cold either.  A plus here is they have a bridal option, but it's by appointment only."
"2","I love it! Sarah is the best personal shopper who not only helps with shopping in the store, but assists with clothes offered in the catalogue only, and offers free shipping. Love the clothes, service, and attention every time I shop."
"1","Hello, 1980s!  Stepping into Shun Lee Palace is like stepping back in time.  The colors of Mauve and Hunter Green abound in the decor.  And lets not forget the swivel chairs.  \n\nWe went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately.  Like someone else mentioned in their review, it was mostly an \""older\"" crowd.  (Perhaps they've been there since the 80s?)   It took quite some time before we were greeted by our server and quite a time longer before she returned to take our orders.  \n\nI like to think that I know my way around a Chinese restaurant, but there were dishes on the menu with which I was not familiar.  And, unfortunately, there were no descriptions.  Tai Chi?  Tung Ann?  New Tze?  Flower Chicken?  Royal Chicken?  Peacock Chicken?  I asked our server about two of them, but didn't want to ask any further and went with Sa Cha Chicken because I knew I had had it someplace once before.\n\nThe food came out as it was made.  First, two (of five) dinners were brought out, one of which had to be taken back because it was wrong.  Then that second one returned with the correct entree.  Then a third dinner came out.  And then finally, the fourth and fifth together.  The food was enjoyable, but a bit on the bland side.  If my entree has a little mark next to it because it's spicy, I want it spicy.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  And there was nothing on the table to doctor it up.  Everything tasted very fresh, though, so kudos for that.  And the kids' entrees were pretty big, so they were a good value.  \n\nI'm wary of Chinese restaurants that don't automatically offer you chopsticks.   I like chopsticks.  I like to eat Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and sushi dinners with chopsticks.  It adds to the experience.  Since we rarely saw our server, I didn't even bother to ask for a pair.  Maybe there was a shortage in the 1980s?  \n\nI'm sure some people have been going to Shun Lee Palace since they decorated in the 1980s and love it.  I, for one, have experienced much better.  Much, MUCH better.  Atmosphere is a big deal for me.  Shun Lee didn't have it, so we won't be going back.  \n\np.s. What's up with the clothing rack in the dining room?  You might think it was for people to hang their coats; however, you'd be wrong.  Apparently it's a rack where the employees can hang their street clothes up during their shifts.  (Because I doubt that anyone took off their T-shirts at dinner because they were too hot.)  Tres tacky."
"1","It pains me to give only one star to what normally is such a consistent chain restaurant. We hadn't been to an O'Charley's in a while and were traveling through, so we stopped in for a drink and appetizer. From the outside it looked great with the new updated exterior.  \n\nIt was mid afternoon, about 2:30, so they weren't busy. Our waiter admittedly was new and didn't know much about the menu. The food came fast but there was a reason for that. It's because it wasn't prepared fresh. First, the fried pickles are terrible because they are made with hamburger dill chips. They were sour and had too much breading that wasn't freshly prepared. And the nachos were a disgrace. Chips thrown on a plate with liquid cheese poured sloppily missing most of the chips, with canned chili and a few tomatoes and green onions sprinkled on. Very sparse to say the least. We were hungry so we ate some, but then left quickly.\n\nAnd when did O'Charley's change their rolls? The ones we were served were dry and dusty - no sweet, shiny coating. \n\nThe restaurant inside was old and looked dirty, and the seats on our booth were ripped. It's badly in need of a re-do. Such a disappointment."
"1","Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."
"1","Worst pho I've ever had. Service is below average. Bubble tea also terrible, the worst I've had. And like the previous yelper wrote, this is not a Vietnamese restaurant. \n\nGo get pho or bubble tea somewhere else."
"1","Me and my boyfriend went out for what we hoped would be a great date night, we decided on Ishi based on the reviews, everything was horrible! I ordered the squid salad which I swear is the same exact one sold at Harris teeters sushi section, then we got an Alaskan roll and an eel roll, the Alaskan was OK but the eel roll was seriously skimpy on the eel, it also had a funny aftertaste. The ginger had a nasty chemical/soapy taste. For dinner my bf ordered steak & chicken ramen which was super greasy and the steak was well done and not the md. rare he asked for. I ordered the ishi steak also well done not md. like I requested, it was just so bland and greasy. The only good thing on my plate was the carrots. The service left alot to be desired as everyone was gathered around the TV watching American idol our waiter only checked on us once and never refilled my drink. I'm not sure if this place has just gone down hill in recent months or the other reviewers like greasy bland food, its about an hour later and me and my bf both have stomach aches, I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!"
"1","I have had 2 experiences with this place. The first time was when I brought my 1974 Corvette in for an oil change. The filter they used was missing the oil sealing ring and when I started the car, my oil was left laying on the ground. The second and final experience was when I brought my daughters Chevy Malibu in for service. They wound up putting the wrong coolant in the radiator which they couldn't (wouldn't) properly repair and I wound up having to get rid of the car. Would never go there again and I tell everyone I know to beware!"
"1","Floyd's is interesting. I came here once when I was doing a selling gig of mine during the summer and I came back to try their food. So I came in for lunch for a take out as my brother and as well as a few friends came down from Raleigh wanted to try it out. I ordered the stew beef as well as doubled the side of the mac n cheese.\n\nLet's just say, if you're going to work out or do anything active in the few to several hours dont. Because I was burping that stuff up and it just didn't feel good. But, that's southern food for you. I felt that the mac-n-cheese was a little watery and wasn't cheesy enough. The stew beef was okay, I guess. The problem with that was it was also too watery and it had no flavor. I was thinking that it would give me a punch because, well it's in a stew. \n\nI think I won't come back here for a while, especially since the aftermath of the meal was horrible. I think when you eat something, the process of eating it and the aftermath is wrapped into one! If you do come here, I suggest you to order the chicken as I heard it wasn't bad. From my experience though, stay away from the stew beef."
"1","Absolute worst hotel experience I have ever had.  Stayed here for 11 nights for business in January with Nicole B.  We each had our own separate set of issues with this place (see her review).  The 3rd party in our group did not have her corporate card yet, so we had to put both her room and mine on my card at check in.  The front desk clerk (Roslyn) advised me that it would be no problem to move the authorization to the new card once my coworkers card arrived, and to remove it from mine. However, that is not what happened.  The card arrived 2 days later (Wed) and the hotel moved the authorization to her card ($750).  The clerk said mine would be removed.  As of Friday morning, the authorization for $750 was still on my card and her card.  Because I had 2 authorization for 2 hotel rooms, this was using up my available credit for our meals for the 2 weeks.  On Friday morning, a different clerk said she wasn't authorized to take care of this issue.  I said excuse me?? Then she said she would try, and proceeded to make a phone call.  She later advised me that there was nothing she could do.  I said this was unacceptable, that I was told this would be addressed at check in, and I could not go the rest of the week without my available credit on my corporate card.  Then Roslyn called me in the room and was very rude, and said that she told me that it would be up to the bank to be released.  That was not what she said, and I work at the bank, I know that all she has to do is call them up and tell them to release it!  She then tried to tell me that the bank had to write a letter to have the authorization released.  How does anyone that works at the front desk not know that all you have to do is call the merchant line and request to remove the authorization??  I was stunned that a hotel would think it would be acceptable to NOT resolve an issue immediately, and that employees would be so rude! I told Roslyn that this was completely unacceptable!  Finally, I received a call from the hotel manager.  She advised me that she would resolve the issue by Saturday morning and she did. While I appreciate that she did finally resolve this, it should not have taken all week and the employees should not have been rude to me.  Additionally, the hotel only gave us a partial receipt at checkout but we did not know this until the following week.  They claimed they checked us out and back in to keep the corporate rate, (which they never told us) but only gave us a partial receipt for the first part of our stay.  I called to get the second receipt and was told by the person that answered the phone that everyone was \""busy\"" and someone would get back to me.  Of course no one ever did.  Luckily corporate approved my charge without the second receipt, because who knows if I ever would have obtained a copy.  What a disgrace, which is suprising for a Marriott."
"1","Mixed feelings about this company. The dispatch staff was polite and concise and the driver was a great guy. However their biggest fail was the actual service.\n\nAfter my initial call I was told a driver was on his way (via dispatch and SMS). Ten minutes later I receive a call from the driver asking where the street was located (don't they have GPS units?).\n\nAfter giving directions I waited... 30 minutes later no driver. Called dispatch again and they said they'd contact the driver. \n\nWaited another 15 minutes and at this point I was getting annoyed. I could have easily been at my destination by now if I had taken the bus! So much for speedy service.\n\nI called dispatch yet again and they said they'd send another driver; after about ten minutes he arrived in a van. However I'm not sure who this van was designed for but it wasn't for adults. I'm 6' tall and my head was hitting the ceiling when I was sitting in the middle row. The seat's headrest must have been designed for kids because at it's highest point it was so low that it was pushing under my shoulder blades.\n\nWell over an hour after my initial call I finally arrived at my destination (which is normally only a 10 minute drive). Nearly a full-half hour slower than riding the \""slow bus\"".\n\nOverall nice staff but absolutely horrible service."
"1","I feel ripped off by my driver this evening. I live in fort mill and I've taken several cab rides to bus stops in fort mill. Today, for the first time ever, the driver magically came up with a 15 dollar surcharge because it was outside of meck county. I've never experienced this in my numerous other rides with yellow cab. I feel totally ripped off and doubt I'll ever use yellow cab again. The whole thing seemed incredibly shady. I believe I was taken advantage of because it was a snowy day out and I needed a ride home."
"1","For a single incident, I would just swallow it.  After these few incidents, I will not use any cab in Charlotte especially from the airport.\nA month ago, I called a cab to the airport early in the morning.  I made it very clear that I need the cab at my house at 6 am as I have a flt to fly out.  I asked if that was posssible, the operator said yes.  It was around midnight when I called.\nAt 6 am, I looked over the window, there was no cab.  6:05 no cab.  I got nervous as I was catching a flt to go to work.  I called yellow cab again, then she said there was no cab available.  I screamed as I would miss my flight to work.  She said she was trying but she had never notified me earlier.  I couldn't wait as the clock ticks. I had no other choice but to wake up my neighbor to give me a ride.  Thank God, with the kindness of my neighbor and my professionalism, I ran and ran and ran inside the airport and finally got to the gate be the last one before they closed the door.\n3 weeks ago, I came home at the airport to take a cab since my house was within 3-4 miles.  It was my first time using a cab.  I didn't know how much here but I had in San Francisco for less than $15 (with airline discount, they charge $12).  So I thought I better to use a cab instead of calling friends around.  I need to go to my house to get my car key then to the hotel right by the airport to get my car.  I explained very clearly to the cab driver who said nothing about the charge.  He didn't turn on the meter as I thought charge shown on meter.  As I got to my house, he said he would charge me double.  I asked how much and why double and what was supposed to be?  He started to yell at me.  Finally, I was charged $28 for a 6 miles ride.  I didn't know if that was acceptable.  I said  to myself I learned, if he overcharged me, I treated that as donation and God blesses.  I was too busy.\nLast night, I took a cab again from CLT airport just to go home that was really 4 miles.  The driver was acting like a wild animal, very unfriendly, talking everything I had no idea what he was talking.  He kept saying I had no idea how long people were waiting.  I asked what people?  Other passengers?  They were behind me and shouldn't be longer than me.  Or the drivers?  I even asked him to take me back to the airport if he didn't want to have the business.  He was driving crazy and I hoped there was a police car closed by.  Unfortunately when we want to see a cop, they were not there but when we didn't want to see them, there was always one.\nFinally, I was safe home.  I still could not understand what was going wrong with these cab drivers.  If someone can help to explain to me.\nBTW, if these cab drivers hate their work, find another one.  I was still figuring out what was their problem.  Perhaps, a few miles were too short the trip?  They were looking for someone who needs to go 100 miles or to another city?  For long ride, people will rent a car for $20-$30 a day and gas.  People need a cab if that is more economic than renting a car for a day.  Anyway, at least I understand why they are still driving an angry cab cos they don't know how to do maths."
"2","As Mike K. said, Costco needs no description. Everyone knows what they and similar stores are like. What it does need is an argument for why you should have a club membership and why it's the best of the 3 major wholesale clubs. I for one, am convinced that absolutely everyone could benefit from a Costco membership.\n\nWHY CLUB MEMBERSHIP?\n1. As with all club stores, gas is 8-15 cents cheaper per gallon than local gas station. You'd be lucky to find it that cheap in SC.\n\n2. Make ONE big ticket purchase, be it new tires, a camera, TV, laptop, whatever, and you'll have saved enough to justify membership and then some!\n\n3. You don't have to be a family of 12 to make bulk food shopping economical. Meat freezes; canned/dry goods last ages; and last I checked, toilet paper doesn't expire. Besides, not everything is sold in gigantic quantities. Often it's just 2-3 regular sized items packaged together.\n\n4. You won't find cheaper beer anywhere. The selection may be limited. But for common brews, it's the way to go.\n\nWHY COSTCO?\n1. At the risk of stirring up sociopolitical controversy, Costco pays their employees - ALL OF THEM - a decent living wage, unlike some places that seem intent on keeping their serfs, um, I mean \""associates\"" in abject poverty and dependent on government assistance programs. And they do it while turning a profit in the billions, proving that their competitors are just greedy and exploitative. \n\n2. With the exception of Charlotte Regional Farmers Market, you won't find cheaper produce ANYWHERE! Red peppers, Brussels sprouts and asparagus are particularly noteworthy. And during summer, they're practically giving away raspberries and blackberries.\n\n3. Then there's the meat. Good god, the MEAT! Do I even need to spell out the benefits of getting it here? What they lack in variety they more than make up for in quality and price. Buy a giant slab of beef, pork, salmon, whatever, cut it into serving sized chunks, freeze them individually and you'll have meat/fish for weeks, if not months."
"1","Unless you're staying here for one quick overnight, don't even bother with this place. Stayed two nights recently and my room stunk of smoke. The AC didn't do anything to help. I called the front desk and told them, and they stated they'd look around and see if someone was smoking in an adjacent room. Next day it smelled the same. \n\nRooms are dark and musty. Carpets need to be replaced. The whole place needed a major redo two years ago."
"2","After I THOUGHT I had ordered a stack of pizzas for a meeting to be delivered at 11:45 am, I called at noon to inquire as to the whereabouts of our lunch to be told I had placed the order for 11:45 PM - ACK!  Panic! SH**!!!!  Whomever the gentleman was who answered the phone put the pizza makers to work immediately and 9 pizzas and an order of wings were delivered within 30 minutes, smoking hot and correct.  5 stars for the excellent customer service that saved me from being drug out back and beaten like a pinata by the hungry mob of nerds... er um... architects.  \n\nOur office orders from this Papa John's quite frequently for meetings and late nights that require the delivery of dinner.  They always get the orders correct, the pizza is always delivered hot and they always bring a stack of plates and napkins - which is nice so we don't have to eat off of legal folders and wipe our hands on our pants.\n\nTHANK YOU, PAPA JOHN'S!"
"1","Ordered food around 8:00 now it's around   11:30, called twice but no answer- weird for a restaurant that is open until 1:30 A.M and has already charged my credit card. When I finally got my food it was cold and sucked- I'm not a food snob either (papa John or dominos delivery pizza is fine by me). The pizza was awful, wings were soggy, and mozzarella sticks were cold on the inside. If you're looking for good service and food aim elsewhere this place was awful- bad enough for me to take the time to download this app, and make a review.."
"1","Crappiest PetSmart ever! The grooming department returned my (extremely short haired Boxer) smelling about as bad as I left him. Awful customer service, dirty, & shelves are rarely stocked correctly. You're better off going somewhere else if you can. It's so bad locally that I've looked into ordering the food online and having it delivered to my door."
"2","Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.\n\nI perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it."
"1","Reservations meant nothing.  We waited.  And waited.  Then we ate.  Sort of. I don't eat mushy pasta.  I had what was purported to be \""pappardelle.\"" Sigh.  It was not.  The Caesar salad was \""made\"" table side.  Or so they pretended.  Lettuce in a bowl tossed with cheese at your table sans egg or anchovy is a side salad.  Caesar was far from hailed. Dry.  Inedible, \n\nIt all comes down to your personal preferences and standards If you are not Italian, have never been to Italy or have never been fed by an Italian, you might like the food.  You might also like Chef Boyardee.  I give this restaurant 1 star because I have to on this site.  Personally, my dead mother is rolling in her grave and  I would like to go into their kitchen and teach them the basics of Italian cooking 101. Starting and ending with the concept of \""al dente.\"""
"2","Great environments! Only downside is service is a bit slow !"
"2","Favorite delivery pizza in town.  Great selection of pies!  Delicious.  Only place we order from now."
"2","Love the convenience of the redbox and inexpensive products! Staff is always helpful when i go in...."
"1","Nice guys, but SLOW! More like Pokie Lube! Only 1 car ahead of mine, and I was promised 20 minutes. Well they must have been reading War and Peace because it took almost 2 HOURS to perform a simple oil change! I didnt ask for any fancy synthetic oil, and it cost $42! Must have added gold flakes to the lube. There are far better, cheaper and faster lube shops out there!"
"1","I pick up lunch from this location once in a while, since there isn't a whole lot to choose from close to my work. This place is packed from 11am- 1pm. The staff is ok... slow but ok. The one thing I have to comment on is that I hate the new automatic response on the drive through. \n\n\""Hi, Welcome to McDonald's. Would you like to try our hot chocolate today?\"" \n\nThen there is a pause... and you get a real person. \n\n\""Hi, can I take your order?\""\n\nUm... No I don't want a hot chocolate... it's July! Why would I want a hot chocolate? \n\nOh... and if you place your order at the first drive through order box, and you pull up to the second one, because you're behind someone you'll go through the same ordeal all over again and then you'll have to explain to the lady on the other end that you've already placed your order.\n\nThat's the price you pay for going to McDonalds.. a headache."
"2","I have been coming here for years and will continue to.  There is a AAA closer to my home, but I drive to this location.  The staff is friendly, the prices are fair and I never felt \""upsold\"" at any time.  Dunkin Donuts across the street is a nice bonus."
"2","I like the staff here.. Came in for a $30 vehicle inspection, found out I needed two tires ($157) not a bad deal. I will continue to come here."
"1","Stayed here while in Charlotte for a meeting.  First impressions were not good.  The desk clerk was busy on the phone taking a reservation and didn't bother to acknowledge me standing there.   \n\nThe lobby and breakfast room are being renovated and are a mess.  The workers had left bottles of water and various equipment in the hallway/stairwell.  Not professional at all.  I passed on the breakfast as I didn't really want to eat it while surrounded by construction debris and dust.\n\nI really wish that their web site had alerted me to the renovations.\n\nThe room was clean, nice sized and in pretty good shape.  The bed was comfortable."
"2","ARROZ CON POLLO!!!!  This place is worth it great staff, great atmosphere, awesome food even down to the little tortilla wit whipped cream and strawberry sauce at the end of the meal. The guy that comes around with the guacamole cart makes killer guacamole. The portions are massive I consider myself a big eater and I have a hard time finishing my meal. The staff is great they come into my store after hours and are just as friendly at that time as they are when at work so I guess that means they are sincere. Great place"
"2","I was meeting my date in the North Lake area, and my friend recommended Azteca in the past, so we decided to check it out!\n\nI got there before he did, so I grabbed a table and ordered a Dos Equis Amber, my favorite, and it was on special!  They brought me chips and salsa to munch on, which were good.  I asked if they had anything spicier- and my server, who was very attentive, sent over one sauce- checked in with me, then sent an even spicier salsa once he realized I could handle it.  I'm all about hot sauces and salsas, and they were both great!  The hotter of the two was pretty crazy I have to admit.\n\nAnyways, my date arrived and we ordered a little later.  He ordered a burrito, which he enjoyed.  I got the mixed fajitas- my usual at a mexican restaurant- and they were decent.  Portion was good for the price- I believe it was around $12.  The shrimp were kinda small, compared to my favorite spot, Three Amigos, in Plaza Midwood.\n\nIt's a big restaurant!  If you have a big group, it would be perfect!  Very attentive service, and I loved the tortilla treat at the end.  Who doesn't like honey and whipped cream?!?  Yum.  I'll hit it up again if I'm in the area!"
"2","We rarely go out on my birthday because it's a major dining holiday - Valentine's Day.  But this time the whole family got together and I chose Azteca, thinking it wouldn't be \""too\"" badly crowded.  Well, it was full, but SO festive and fun!  We sat at the bar while we waited for our table for 7, and the bartender was entertaining and quick with our margaritas, even making a little virgin margarita for the youngster with us.  We got our table fairly quickly, and we kept our waiter entertained and coming back and forth pretty quickly, too, considering the room was full of party groups.  As always, the food was filing and delicious!  This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, and it was really good to be back, and share it with 3 in our party who had never been.  They are now fans, as well."
"2","During lunchtime. Very good. Chicken soup some of the best I have ever had. The pico great also."
"1","Impressively consistent poor service.  Been there 12 times but the tasty guacamole and carne asada can only distract me for so long before I break! They are downright mean and lazy.  Go to Don Pedro.  Same corporate owners and recipes but better staff.  'Nuff said!"
"1","I have always been a customer at Azteca and I usually order the exact same thing. Tortilla soup with the chips on the side. Today I was really craving some tortilla soup from there. I offered it carry out which I never do but I was in a rush. When I got there I gave the person up front the money and I noticed my food was completely wrong. The actual water from the soup was on the side instead of the chips so I told them and they kept arguing with me telling me I was wrong! I asked them for my money back and they said they would not give it to me since I ordered the food. I kept on asking for my money back and the manager herself told me I was \""badly educated\"". I told them fine and walked out with my change. Never got my food. Oh yeah and they charged me .50cents for a to go water. \nThe manager should never ever tell a paying customer that they are badly educated. I asked nicely for them to give me my money back and thy didn't. I paid $8.12 for them to criticize me. Ridiculous. I guess my Azteca days are over."
"1","Usually I really like this place and go often BUT I had a rotten experience here last night that has ruined my opinion of this place forever. \nI went with a friend at night and ordered drinks. I gave a card and ID for my tab and my friend paid for drinks with cash as he got them. At the end of the night My friend checked out and then I paid the bill. I then found out that our waitress was billing my friends drinks to my tab while she's pocketing cash from my friend.\nI had to sign for the bill and the manager essentially told me to take a long walk off a short pier. \nUsually this place quite good but at night it turns to a den of thieves."
"1","The most low-rent taco bell i ever been to"
"1","This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken. \n\nThe atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff.\n\nI hope to return soon and update my review ( :"
"2","Been here a couple of times so far. Each time the service has been great and the food great as well. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times but their coleslaw is a bit strange as I'm not accustomed to a mustard based slaw. My husband ordered the Brunswick stew both times and its very good. Their sweet tea is pretty awesome too. The banana pudding is pretty darn good too. Oh and they seat you immediately even when the place is packed. Basically you can't go wrong with Bill Spoons...."
"1","I've been going to Pressley Park since forever and it's always been a dependable \""meat+three\"" place to go. Last week I was in the area and stopped in for lunch. I happened to be in a hamburger mode so I ordered the double cheeseburger. I will have to say that cheeseburger was one of the worst cheeseburgers I've had. Two pieces of identical slabs of hamburger that looked like they had just gone from the freezer to the bun, bypassing the flattop altogether. Cheese squares then flopped on and hardly melted. All on a sort of dry bun. It just wasn't what I was expecting or what should have been served.\nYes, I'll go back some day but will probably stick with the veggie plate."
"2","Spoiler: I don't golf.\n\nI've been to Leatherman's twice recently, once to play at the driving range and once to play miniature golf.  They have a decent selection of clubs that you can borrow if you're like me and have nothing related to golf.  The pro shop looks pretty cool and the people were nice when I was in buying a bucket.\n\nNow the fun stuff, miniature golf.  This isn't one of those courses with giant animals & cheesy holes, but its a well maintained 18-hole course with a few sneaky holes.  Adults are $7.00 and it is pretty challenging - I got nowhere near par, but it definitely was fun!"
"2","Trust the sign. This really is the cheapest place to get your shoes repaired in town. Mr. Lee does the repairs in house whereas others send it out, take a commission and pass on the extra expense to the customers."
"2","Great local place for breakfast!   Traditional breakfast specials at a great price and my favorite eatery ANYWHERE for livermush and grits!"
"2","Best Vietnamese in town! I used to live in Laos, and visited Vietnam a number of times. This place is a great memory lane for me. Really quick service, cozy feeling dining hall. I have never done the buffet, I always order strictly Viet food from the menu and have never been let down."
"1","Don't do it! The food took forever and when my husband's steak finally came (which he had ordered medium rare) it was well-done. They sent it back and the replacement was tar-tar, absolutely raw inside. The atmosphere was lackluster and the entire experience was bad."
"2","This place is awesome.I shop here more than any other store in the area. fantastic selection of new and used music and video.Cool collectable stuff...a great place for gift shopping!The staff rocks...I love this pace!"
"1","Jaipur is definitely a hit or miss kind of joint. They do lack consistency in quality, flavor, spice distribution and amount of food given.\n\nToday the order came out completely wrong and had to be redone. The shrimp tikka masala was made of rubbery chewy farmed fish and the medium heat was non existent. There was no spice involved. The tikka masala had no cream consistency to it today. It was very runny and overpoweringly tomato based. \n\nThe first experience I had merited 3 stars, the second time I ate there they qualified for 3.5 stars, and this last time they really went down to 1 star. I'm averaging them out at 2 stars after three tries.\n\nI've exhausted my attempts. The inconsistency is too great and for the price they shouldn't be lacking at all. I will not eat here again."
"1","I'm always on the lookout for your basic meat and 2/3 restaurant so when I saw La'Wan's in a strip shopping center on South Tryon, I thought I'd give it a try. The service was immediate and attentive. They have a buffet and a menu from which to order. I chose the buffet because I wanted some vegetables. Although the food tasted fine, the buffet is very limited in choices: salad, cabbage, fried chicken and a couple of other choices. This would have been OK except that they charged over $9.00 for it. If I go back, I should probably choose from the menu."
"1","The manager, Michael is not a people person. No personality what so ever. The rooms suck."
"2","I'll keep this short and to the point...\n\nI went to CarMax to get an appraisal for a car I wanted to sell.  I chose CarMax because I didn't want to go through the process of posting a listing on Craigslist, Autotrader, etc.  My thought was if they gave me a good price I would sell my car on spot.  The service was quick, they have a very friendly staff and the appraisal took 15 minutes.  I was expecting the appraisal to be ~50% of what I had previously valued my car (using KBB and Edmonds), they blew me away and offered 80%.\n\nI couldn't have been happier.  I'll definitely refer friends/family to CarMax as a great way to sell cars."
"1","I usually love bk, this one is sub-par. I'm pretty sure they don't change their oil enough. I also received a much smaller double cheeseburger than I expected. The thing was kids sized. Bad value overall. They also shorted us on the cold-fries."
"1","Finally came in here once recently. It's pretty ok. Nothing to write home about, but decent food not too overpriced."
"2","Ah Walgreen's...  just like any other large chain store, you are predictable and pretty dependable when it comes to pharmacological needs as well as any other convenient products needed.  This particular location at the corner of Lebanon and Lawyers Rd is fairly convenient, yet their parking lot is not the case with the entrances located at weird (extreme) ends of the corner so it takes you a couple of sharp turns to get you into the lot and parked.\n\nOther than the parking situation, the store is fairly clean and organized.  I may have gone in a couple days when they were restocking and stuff was everywhere, but it was only temporary.  This location also seems to have a smaller over-the-counter remedies section, but I'm sure they probably have it organized just a tad bit different from the Walgreen's I usually frequent."
"2","I dont go here for the pharmacy...I go here for the sales! \n\nGrowing up I thought that everything cost more at stores of convenience, but I was wrong. So wrong. Their milk and toilet paper are on sale every other week, they always have tons of stuff on clearance, and for a smoker like me, you cant beat their prices.\n\nI also love all the women who work here. It's like small town service."
"1","Used to love this place. But they are always rude and they never fail to get my order terribly wrong."
"1","Just a basic  joint serving basic food. It's about as worn-out as the food they serve. Good place to go for the stuff you could prepare at home."
"2","Great Indian food! I definitely recommend going for the lunch buffet on the weekend for a sampling of many dishes, especially if you are new to Indian food or to the restaurant. Some dishes are, of course better than others, but overall the food is quite delicious. I would imagine non-vegetarians would enjoy this restaurant as well, for it's bold, complex flavors. I was there around 2 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed, which is always a good sign!"
"2","Best Chinese take out in Charlotte. Huge portions and great prices. They have been very consistent for the 15+ years I have been eating there. The same lady is always there, I feel bad because she never has a day off. Seriously I have never been there when she wasn't there. My favorites, sesame chicken, general Tso's, cashew chicken, sweet and sour chicken. Great egg rolls and fried rice."
"1","Chopsticks in Matthews is 10times better, All we tasted was salt, salt,  and more salt. The eggrolls was hard and where were the stuffing? The fried rice tasted like white rice with rubber shrimp in it. Worst Chinese ever."
"1","My wife and I stopped in here last night. We were seated promptly and our server took our order right away. We each had the baby back ribs. Both our orders were burned and the server never came back to check on us. It was the manager who finally came over and we sent our ribs back and he did refill our drinks. Not a very good experience."
"1","I'm very upset with University Dermatology. They sent my bill to a wrong address (it ended up with a neighbor since it was a digit off) and then sent it to collections before talking to me. I payed the bill with collections, only to receive a notice from the office later that I could no longer receive care from them because of the late payment. Completely unprofessional! When I called the office to explain that when I did eventually receive my bill it had a mis-typed address, they were rude to me and didn't care that I was paying collections to fix an issue that wasn't even my fault. I didn't write the wrong address on my paperwork, your staff needs to be careful about missing numbers. Now I have to find a new dermatologist, since they won't see me anymore."
"1","Incompetent idiots; these people are. Don't waste your time with this Enterprise location. Thumbs down."
"2","Primarily chose this place because they delivered. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and was pleased with it along with speedy delivery.  I would try this place again and would recommend to friends."
"1","It could be the worlds best Chinese, but customer service and delivery method are putrid. I placed an order an order and asked for delivery. Order of five meals for friends and myself for dinner, so it is a very profitably delivery. I call an hour and fifteen minutes after the order and they forget my order and say it will be another twenty to thirty minutes. \n\n\nI will never call back and will not be advising any of my friends or coworkers to go there either."
"1","Cauliflower $4.49 a head, really??? Fresh Chicken breast $10 - $11 for 3 breasts (1.5 lb), really?.....With the recent New Year 30 Day Paleo Challenge all over social media, it appears Harris Teeter, Prosperity Church Rd means to cash in and gouge it's loyal customers, by raising prices on products commonly used by customers trying to lose weight. Aldi, across the street, is selling cauliflower for $2.00/ head and managing to reap a decent profit without gouging their customers. We ALL have to eat....what other products are you attempting to gouge the public on.  My family spends over $15,000 / year on groceries. I have added one more resolution to my list...to make sure Harris Teeter gets very little of that!!! Good way to drive away customers!!"
"1","Ordered a large Mango-Pineapple smoothie. Stayed in line 5 minutes from the time I ordered. Which was okay, I made sure I started out 10 minutes early for the trip. $3.64 for a large. Got to the window stayed an additional 3 minutes. No big deal. Until...... Ma'am We no have Mango. We have Um.. Strawberry. Reluctantly I said Ok... It's just Strawberry right? Not Strawberry-Banana? Si Strawberry- Banana. Side note...( I don't like Strawberry- Banana) No ma'am I would just like my money back... refund please... she gave me $3.53 back? Wasted my time and made a profit! Geez!!"
"2","Perfect choice for a great salad bar and finish with a free soft ice cream cone! Delicious soups and sandwiches and very kid friendly. Their boxed lunches are great for group meetings, too."
"2","I just love going to Bi-Lo. They have a lot of Buy 1, Get 1 deals every week for a lot of major name brand items, which also have coupons to match. In addition, you get Fuel Perks for all money spent, plus bonus fuel perks. One thing most people don't know is that you get money towards fuel perks for gift card purchases. Their Gift Card shelving includes almost every gift card except Target or Wal-Mart. So you can get those birthday and anniversary gift cards and get fuel perks back. The fuel perks work at Shell Gas Stations and there's a comparable priced one that is right across the street. \n\nThe store overall seems a little older than some I've seen, but it's always clean. In addition, the customer service reps are always very friendly. You usually don't have a long wait. They always have a register open. \n\n\nOverall, my grocery store of choice."
"2","Domino's are I guess all supposed to be the same, however this one really shines.\n\nMy food is always correct, the drivers are always quick and the pizza's always taste great! \n\nOnline ordering is simple and a snap, and I love the Pizza Tracker.\n\nIn all this Domino's has a great staff and I really enjoy my lazy dinner days from them.\n\nThanks"
"2","Nice little sandwich shop off Steele Creek Rd in a local shopping center. The food was good, I ordered Italian and my girlfriend ordered the tuna sandwich. The sandwiches were good but I feel like the lettuce was a little soggy. I would come here again, it's definitely a convenient location."
"2","Local favorite. Wife and I been coming here for years. Breakfast special is my fav!"
"1","Was able to get in and out, but something about this store doesn't quite add up.  Maybe it's the close calls by cars zipping through the parking lot, or how the store is so far into the WhiteHall complex (feels like you are driving forever once you turn off of S.Tryon).\n\nWalmart is what it is... some locations slightly better than others... this is on the other end in my book.  Luckily I only have to go here once in a while.  It does serve a good place to kill time if you are waiting for someone to arrive at the airport."
"1","I've always liked the auto bell and I go to several around town.    You can get out of the car while they clean it, or you can sit in your car thru the wash and just drive off w/o waiting to get it dried, if you're in a hurry.\n\nI've had issues with this particular auto bell recently,  though.   On at least four occasions I've asked for the trunk of my car to be vacuumed only to find out later it wasn't done.  I've got an suv that collects a good bit of debris from landscaping supplies, so I'm always asking they make sure the back gets vacuumed out thoroughly.  They always seem to acknowledge what I'm asking, so I don't know where the disconnect is, but I hate being at the market later only to find out the back hasn't even been touched when I go to load my groceries.\n\nSame thing happened just this weekend, except this time I checked before driving off.   Nope - hadn't even been touched.   As dirty as when I pulled in.   The guy whow as drying my car took care of it right away, but it should have been handled when they other guys were doing the vaccuming before it went through the wash.   A quick trip to the car wash just took longer than expected.\n\nStark contrast to the auto bell in Clover I like to go to.  No communication issues there.   I ask they make sure the back is vacuumed and it's done.  Much friendlier staff there, too,  in my opinion."
"2","This is your standard Chick-Fil-A - consistently good food with friendly staff.\n\nThis Chick is located off of South Blvd in the same shopping center as a movie theater, Target, Old Navy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, Michaels and a bunch of other stuff.  The traffic pattern in the center can be a bit of a cluster, but isn't that true of most shopping centers?  Coming through a little before 11:30 am on a Thursday, I drove straight up to the call box, ordered my #1, quickly paid and was on my way.  The condiments I requested were in the bag, the lack of pickles that I requested was honored and my tea was perfectly sweet.  Eat mor chikin!"
"2","World Market sells a lot of different unique things, from Houseware items, to Furniture, to Wine & Specialty Foods.  I always enjoy looking around as they always have things you can't find anywhere else.  But for me I'm a big fan of the Stirrings brand Drink Mixers that they sell there which are made from Sugar Cane and doesn't include the High Fructose Corn Syrup that are acustom in other Mixers..  Now you can get these usually at others stores, but World Market always has a bigger selection as other retailers might just have two kinds.  I'm a also a fan of there Wine selection as the prices are always decent and they run specials all the time.  I recommend going to World Market just to at least window shop at there unique selections of pretty much everything....lol."
"2","For the moment, I have a gun in my home that a friend has lent me so that I could decide if this is something I really want around. So far, only good things to say. I've been to a defensive pistol association \""shoot\"" so that I could get better not just at hitting a stationary piece of paper but also be comfortable handling this weapon in a more 'active' situation.\n\nI had already stopped by Hyatt and checked out their accessories, finding them to be much more expensive than anything available on the Internet. While they were very helpful, I thought it might be best to shop around. Which brought me to Carolina Sporting Arms.\n\nSimilarly stocked with accessories in a neatly organized manner, a sales guy was immediately able to help point me to what I was looking for. And I found that here too, it's very expensive compared to Internet pricing. So that's two.\n\nIf you're looking for something that cant be shipped FedEx (like a gun or live ammunition) or if there is something you need right away, then here is a good stop. But if you can wait for it, there are any number of sporting goods vendors on the Internet that will save you a bunch of money."
"1","Highly overpriced!!  Even after you haggle down the price is above average with a lower than average quality product.  On top of that, their storage is tiny, so you have to come back later to pick your purchase up.\nEXAMPLE: Bought a TV stand. Waited THREE DAYS to be able to pick it up.  Waited in line for the pickup for nearly an hour. Got home and SIX PIECES WERE MISSING!! Called and they were happy to provide replacements, but I had to WAIT SIX MORE DAYS for the replacement parts to arrive. When we went to pick up the parts they were reluctant to give them to us. Ughh!"
"2","As far as Chinese places in this area , I think this is one of the best. Their food is less greasy than wang and king and they are very fast and affordable . Had way better Chinese food in Florida and the UK to be honest but for around here this place can't be beat...   (:"
