"5","why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass table?","or even on some surfaces?","Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.  The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.  \nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly."

"3","What is Trans Fat? How to reduce that?","I heard that tras fat is bad for the body.  Why is that? Where can we find it in our daily food?","Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. \nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods."

"7","In the san francisco bay area, does it make sense to rent or buy ?","the prices of rent and the price of buying does not make sense to me, mostly the rent will not cover the mortgage . Is it better to rent a house or to buy?","renting vs buying depends on your goals. <br />\ngenerally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.\nhaving said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.\nbottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. the other numbers tend to even out, the main gain or loss in buying comes from appreciation/depreciation."
"5","What's the best way to clean a keyboard?","I have very small stuff stuck under my keyboard and it prevents it to from working. What will be the be\nst way to clean it?","There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning. \nAfter turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles. \nUse the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys. \nDampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys. \nUse the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris. <br />\nIf you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. If you are still feeling industrious, next you can tackle cleaning your mouse. \nOf course, if cleaning your keyboard seems a truly undesirable task, you can always buy a new one for around $20."
"2","Why do people blush when they are embarrassed?","Why do people blush when they are embarrassed?","from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our ""fight or flight"" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. <br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the ""fight or flight"" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. \nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. \nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness.>>"

"2","How the human species evolved?","How the human species evolved?","A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. Since you asked ""how the human species evolved?"" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for ""fit"" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology."
"4","Who said the statement below and what does it mean?","Can someone help me with understanding someone else's wisdom, please?&#xd;<br><br>"" It is very easy in the world to live by the opinion of the world. It is very easy in solitude to be self-centered. But the finished man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. ""","That is kind of a tricky little quote. Sometimes placing it in context can help. This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay ""Self Reliance,"" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the ""independence of solitude""). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a ""finished man"" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced ""perfect sweetness"" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \nWhat do you think?"

"5","what's the best way to create a bootable windos/dos CD?","i don't use floppies any more and need to boot from something other than my hard disk","Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD.  If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you.  There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.\nIf you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ .  This process is not very straightforward though.\nIf you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS.  For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want.  For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs."
"9","what is the reason for the increasing divorce percentage in the western world?","what is the most common parameter that causing couples to separate","IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values, needs, etc.). Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce, and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want, and you get an increasing percentage.\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.\nA parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life?

"2","How a black hole is formed?","I would like to know how a black hole can possibly be formed. Are there any experimental evidence of such creation?","The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in."
"2","Heavy water","what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process?","Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium."

I was put up there as a corporate apartment. While it was fine, it was relatively expensive, and the rooms were small. It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms, which are particularly American. The smell of cooking, people watching TV, people eating -- these all seem like activities that should be separated from one another. Call me old fashioned.  \nThe Avalon had a big gym, however, which was very good, and concierge service, which was very convenient. Most of them were very friendly. One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!  Also convenient was its proximity to the Caltrain, the Safeway across the street and the Starbucks. But if you crave culture, this ain't it: everything is a chain store nearby.\nSo depending on your budget, your need for convenience and culture, and your tolerance for small rooms and/or omnirooms, it may suit you."

"6","Formula1 car","What makes a Formula1 car a fast car?","Let me break it down-\nEngine- 3 liter V10.  Approximately 900+ hp, 19,000 rpm.  The engine weighs about 200 lbs.  It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.  Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994)."
"2","how was Einstein's General Relativity theory proven ?","When was it, where was it and by whom?","First, I would never say that a theory has been proven. There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory."

So as the rotors turn, air flows more quickly over the tops of the blades than it does below. This creates enough lift for flight."

"2","Capturing light in a container","Can we capture light in a container? Will it run and shine forever? What kind of internal material we should use in order to do that?","So the answer to your specific question is 'no'.  The problem is that if the container shines, it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out.  There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics."

Google's true competitor is often seen as being Microsoft, not Yahoo. This would support your claim that they are complementary."
"2","Do animals have feelings?","can an animal feel regrets , compassion, sad, fear etc?","It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.  Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on.  On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state.  With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals.  \nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.  If this is so, then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses."

I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.\nIn the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full ""AP"" Calculus, where the ""AP"" stands for ""Advanced Placement"" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College)."
"7","Why is there often a mirror in an elevator?","What is the history behind it?","The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical.\n\nHere's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html\n\n""In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \n\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \n\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\n\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\n\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \n\n\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \n\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\n\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all."" \n\n"

"10","Why can Bush get away with misinforming us about intelligence, then use that as reason for war?","Why can Bush get away with misinforming us about intelligence and then using that as reason for war?","Because the American public is more willing to forgive presidents that don't project themselves as smarter then them.  Its similar to how Oliver North and the Irancontra scandal in the 80's did not affect Reagan's popularity, but how Clinton's ""lies"" about Monica almost resulted in impeachment.

They are a surprising phenomenon because gamma rays are so powerful that very few events could cause them.  They have also only been recently discovered by projects like the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and appear to be coming from all directions, not just in the galactic plane.\nThis would indicate a phenomenon that has extra-galactic origins... for example, activity inside of an active galactic nuclei, or quasars.\nBecause they happen at random intervals, abd are ephemeral (often just a few seconds), and the ""scopes"" used to capture them are not tightly directional, we don't have any instruments currently that can figure out exactly what they are.  For now that means, the best we can do is hypothesize based on what cosmic events we believe are of the appropriate magnitude to tigger gamma rays."
"2","Why's watching Television so addictive?","Whereas reading books isn't in general (no doubt there are some avid readers but  I am talking about the majority).","I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information. TV is video and audio. You can see and hear it and thus more information can be squeezed into a short amount of time while also giving a much richer experience. Next time you're watching TV, consider how much you would have to write just to completely describe a single frame.\nLast, TV is also much easier because it's a passive medium. Reading requires your brain to work harder to both read the words and then interpret them into visuals. TV is already visual and can be watched with much less focus & energy."

However, Mark Twain had a point when he said ""The coldest Winter I ever spent was Summer in San Francisco.""\nThis is because the warm air from inland (where it gets quite hot in the Summer) clashes with the cold air from the surrounding Pacific Ocean and the SF Bay. When that happens, fog forms. Further explanation from http://kids.earth.nasa.gov: ""At night, the ground surface cools by radiating heat to space. Air near the ground cools to the dew point temperature, causing water in the air to condense.""\nSure it's cold, but fog can be quite beautiful and atmospheric.

"3","Why does it seem that most of the diets don't work on over weight people?","","I think that the main reason is that obese people should be treated as drug addict. The main problem is that both obese and drug addicts have habits that causing them to either eat or do drug. Both of them also have physical addiction that needed to be treated accordingly. Only after facing those two major factors it will be the time for diets. <br />\nAnother major issue is that the society actually unknowingly supports obesity; let me give you an example- today in the US, an obese person can claim disability and get welfare. By that, the government actually encourages obesity. Why would someone even try to get better? <br />\nAuthorities should condition those allowances: if you lose weight over a specified period you will continue getting it. If you did not lose weight you lose the allowance.<br />\nWe should always keep in mind that obesity costs a lot more then just the allowance that the obese person gets. There is the health costs, taxes lost and so on.<br />\nI say- do what you can to leave healthy life, and don’t give up"

"10","How come the usage of alternate power generators is not more prevalent in a state like Californi","One would expect that it would be of an interest of states to have alternate resources.","California electricity is generated by several sources, including hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and nuclear (in addition to the more traditional natural gas).  The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear).  As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up, and world demand for energy increases, the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.\nIncidentally, solar power is another source used in California, but it's provided by individuals, not power companies.  If your house has solar power and you have the right equipment, you can sell your surplus electricity to the power company and your electric meter will literally run backward."

"1","When do you use a semicolon instead of a colon?","","While historically the use of the semicolon and colon were similar, modern usage seems to be diverging, with semicolons indicating breaks slightly stronger than commas and colons introducing lists and explanations. \nSemicolons have always been used in a manner very similar to commas, but with greater ""weight.""  That is, the semicolon introduces greater breaks in the sentence, dividing clauses which are longer and more independent, while commas are reserved for short pauses and for separating lists of short items.\nContinuing up the continuum, colons are ""weightier"" than semicolons, but less so than periods.  They introduce a break which is longer or more important than that introduced by semicolons, but not as final as periods.  Colons separate clauses which can stand as independent sentences grammatically, while semicolons can also be used for non-sentential clauses.\nHowever, in modern writing the colon is rarely used in this role as glorified semicolon.  The colon has developed a specific semantics as a break separating an introduction from an explanation.  For example, the colon is used after the salutation in formal letters.  It is used to introduce quotes, separating the source from the quoted text.  A colon is used to introduce a list, included bulleted lists.  A colon is used to separate the parts in a multipart title, such as ""Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books"" or ""Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't""."
"2","Why do people amputate dogs tail?","What is the reason that some types of dog are considered to be better off with out their tail?","There are a couple of reasons why this was done a few decades ago.  Dogs with curved tails are known to be chasing flies and fleas that got on their tails. Owners of the dogs found this a nuisance that all of a sudden a dog would keep chasing its tail for several hours in a week. Due to this dogs forgot their ""job"" which was to guard sheep, or pull carts, etc.\nSecondly, certain dogs go very wild if we pull their tails, even if its done playfully. They simply get mad at you, bite you or even kill you, if you are small.  Since little children always found it playful to pull the tails of the dogs and this meant a potential danger to their lives, the owners cut their tails short. \nEver thought of the word CUR-TAIL? :-)"

"2","Why do we yawn?","How is it contagious...","Found an interesting article on this...\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out” to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. \nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy."
"2","Which cat has the largest variety of prey?","","In Africa, a pride of lions (male: ~400 lbs, female: ~280 lbs) pretty regularly hunt wildebeest (440-600 lbs), although they usually go after the sick or young ones.  Occasionally, they can take down a giraffe (2420-4250 lbs), but this doesn't happen often.  Elephants (11,000 lbs) and rhinos (2500 lbs) are just a little dangerous to be bothered.\nIn Asia, tigers can take down a water buffalo (1800-2600 lbs), although again, they usually go for the sick or young ones.\nThese are the cats with the largest prey."

"8","Who is Earth-2 Superman and how is he different from regular Superman?","Why are there two Supermen and why is one older than the other?","It's relatively simple.  Back in 1961, DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters.  Some characters (Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth, while others (The Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom) were radically different.  \nEarth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's, mostly adhering to the classic ""Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound"" description.  Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light, juggle planets, and had a host of super powers including super-breath, super-ventriloquism, and super-hypnotism.  Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's ""Crisis on Infinite Earths.""  Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?,"" a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity.  Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character, which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.\nEarth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since ""Crisis;"" once in 1999's ""Kingdom Come,"" and most recently in 2005's ""Infinite Crisis.""  What his role is in this maxiseries is undetermined as of this writing.  Earth 1's Superman has yet to reappear, but longtime fans can always hope."
"10","How do you become a judge on the Supreme Court?","What are the necessary qualifications and the process to get on the high court?","There are nine seats on the United States Supreme Court.

"2","What is the oldest evidence of life?","","Some evidence of photosynthesis was found on rocks in Greenland dating from 3.7 billion years ago. Danish researchers reached that conclusion analyzing the relative abundance of uranium and thorium in some rocks, and the high abundance of uranium in those suggests that there was oxygen present. Their conclusion was that microorganisms like present day cyanobacteria were converting sunlight to chemical energy through oxygen-producing photosynthesis."
"8","Where did the band, The Dismemberment Plan, get their name from?","","Straight from Travis Morrison (singer and guitarist) himself:<br />\n""It’s from the movie Groundhog Day. There’s a guy who chases after Bill Murray and tries to keep selling him different types of insurance and 'the dismemberment plan' was one of them. It just stuck.""  In another interview, Morrison admits that when you're young, you think things are incredibly funny when, in reality, they're not THAT funny.  Considering all the nicknames they earned, I think it was a rather witty, catchy band name.  Best,<br />\n`k."
"8","What does 'zig' refer to in the All Your Base clip?","You all remember that ""All Your Base Are Belong to Us"" internet phenomenon from early 2000.

This is really quick and easy (AKA: cheap) to start.  If you don't know exactly what you want to do it is a good way to see how it will work without a huge investment.  If you are successful in that marketplace you can take it to the next level and expand into a more traditional business model with less risk!  \n\nTry playing around with writing a business plan and see what your risk and financial tolerance is.

They give clues to the context and meaning beyond a simple description. They're like finding notes in a text book scribbled by a previous owner. You can usually gain insight into the material based on those notes. \n\nNow imagine there is a cross-reference of all those post-its and margin notes. More than one person can add their own post-it. You can easily find the most popular ""post-its"" thanks to an index of all of them.  This is where the real power of tagging lies-- in the weight and meaning these agreed-upon notes give.\n\nOf course, context is everything. Next time you're together, show her MyWeb2.0 and del.icio.us in action. Show her how the information is sliced and diced-- most recent, most popular, most frequently used tags. I find my parents only get these new paradigms when I show them to them in context."

"9","What are the effects of parental favoritism?","","From my personal experience, I've seen parental favoritism cause lifetime effects. \nMy mom's brother was the favorite- she was the least favored. 50 years later, she still struggles with feeling inadequate and has a hard time trusting people. Because of this, she has a hard time maintaining friendships and family relationships.\nMy grandmother and her sister were treated differently by my great-grandfather. My grandmother was treated as the most special. Her sister was expected to do chores, take care of the family etc. She ended up being the dependable, reliable one because she developed her independence. She also never forgave her father or her sister for their unfair treatment. My grandmother grew up needing others to take care of her.\nThis is a pattern I've seen. Those that are favored end up developing few of their skills and talents. Many times they grow up becoming more concerned about pleasing other people. And many times they don't know how to take care of themselves.\nThose that are disfavored can become strongly independent, but they may also have weaknesses in their ability to trust others and form lasting relationships. What is true is that favoritism has an unhealthy emotional impact on all children, whether favored or not.\nA good book that deals with this subject is The Emotional Incest Syndrome : What to do When a Parent's Love Rules Your Life, by Dr. Patricia Love."

"6","Why are the San Francisco 49er's Sucking so Bad Again?","What's up with the team again?  Offensive line? Coaching?","1.  Poor drafting.  Between 2000-2006, the 49ers drafted 55 players. Only 8 starters on offense from all of those draft classes combined, and only four at the 'skill positions' (Barlow, Lloyd, Battle and Smith).\n\n2.  Injuries:  9 guys on IR, including starting Center, starting T, starting FS and SS, starting LB and starting TE.\n\n3.  Four different starting QBs this season.\n\n4.  Barlow not a difference maker/elite back.  His 3.3 yards per carry are actually worse than last year!\n\n5.  Unimaginative play calling (other than first game of season).\n\n6.  49ers lead the league by a wide margin in number of series that go 3-and-out.  This leaves the defense vulnerable."
"2","what is the temperature on the sun and how to calculate the lost of heat per distance from it?","So, what will be the distance from the sun that makes it reasonable to look for life?","You might not have intended it, but your question is a lot more complex than you might have thought.  It turns out that the temperature of the sun is a function of how deep into the sun you are, with the surface temperature being about 6000 Kelvins.  To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins.\n\nThis fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.\n\nNow for the second part of your question:\n\nThe light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun.  The ""heat"" is another thing entirely, because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles, and photons don't count strictly in that definition.\n\nThere are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind, and around the region of the Earth, they have a ""temperature"" around 1000k."

Delhomme has a better #1 receiver in Smith although Horn is healthy and is pretty good in his own right but Brooks has the better #2 receiver in Stallworth so that balances it out a little.  Neither is a great option and it's a tough call so I think you gotta go with the guy who's performed better so far this year which is Delhomme.  You might want to check the waiver and see if somebody like McMahon - the new Philly QB is available as he's got a nice matchup this week and could be better than your two current options."

"6","I'm new to road biking and need a bike under $1000. What frame and parts do you recommend?","","I'd agree with TaraN's answer. Take the time to really find what you want. Take a lot of extended test rides. You might find that aluminum might be too harsh for you, in which case you might find that steel or carbon might be more comfortable. That's just one example. Lots of test rides will give you a feel for how the various bikes at a given price point can handle very differently. Without getting into too much tech-speak, you might find that one bike handles a bit more twitchy than another. Think of the difference as driving a Mini Cooper versus a basic sedan. Some bikes are set up more for racing, where you'll get a quicker handling bike, whereas others will handle a bit more laid back.\n\nParts wise, you'll find the same component offerings on many of the manufacturers out there for a given price point, as TaraN pointed out. You'll most likely be getting a bike with Shimano componenets, with perhaps a mix of some of the manufacturer's own branded components (for example, Trek outfits their bikes with a lot of Bontrager componentry).\n\nFocus on the overall ride of the bike. For a $1000, you can get a lot of bike.\n\nWade at The Spokesman in downtown Santa Cruz is a GREAT guy - very helpful, and yes, very patient. He's very knowledgeable and will set you up right.\n\nAlso in that same category, I'd highly recommend seeing Vance Sprock over at Cupertino Bike Shop. He's just like Wade - he'll set you up right.\n\nGood luck!"

"6","Why doesn't college football have a playoff system?","Every year sportswriters and fans complain about how unfair the BCS is, so what's preventing the various conferences from a playoff system?","- The bowls came first and have to be dislodged\n\n- The bowl organizers control larges amounts of money.  Some of these monies are given to participating universities and their conferences. Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\n\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year.  Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing.  Also due the physical nature of the game, players need several days to recovery.  This limits games to about one every 5 days or so (about one a week). A playoff system would require the two teams meeting for the championship to play and additional 2-4 games depending on the number of teams allowed to participate in the playoffs."
"8","What kind of guitar is that?","What kind of guitar is Joaquin Phoenix playing in the ""Germany"" scenes in Walk the Line?  You can see the one I mean at about 30 seconds and 50 seconds (the hangar and the music store) in the trailer on Yahoo! Movies.\n\nIt doesn't appear to have a standard sound hole, just two curved openings on either side of the strings.  It's almost like an archtop, but I can't believe it's an electric; that seems out of character and you never see him with an amp.\n\nBonus points, where can I buy one?","Can't answer your question exactly, but it looks an awful lot like a Gibson archtop or a Gretsch.  You can poke around either of their websites to see guitars that look pretty similar to the one in the picture.  There are particular models of Gibson & Gretsch that have the diagonal bridge piece that appears in the movie -- Gretsch calls it a ""chromatic tailpiece"".  I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\n\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious ""soapbar"" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then)."
"6","What is a good entry-level road bike to purchase?","I am looking to spend roughly $1,500.","For $1500, you're starting to get out of the ""entry-level"" stage. I have a Trek 1000 and absolutely love it. I've used it for century rides, triathlons and duathlons no problem. The Trek 1000 was about $900 CDN. The only difference in the bikes up to the $1500 range is the shifters are usually a little better (they don't stretch as easily, which makes shifting cleaner for longer). The weight and wheels are basically the same. \n\nIf you want to trim 30 sec off your race time, you might consider the more expensive bikes. But, you should be an elite athlete to really notice the difference. \n\nI'd go for a $1000 bike and spend the rest on pumps (road and home), spare tires, some nice cycling clothes, tools and a bike computer. Maybe even a trainer for home use."
"6","Who holds the single season rushing yards in NFL?","","While it is true that Eric Dickerson holds the single season *total* rushing yards record, he accomplished this in a 16-game season. On the other hand, O.J. Simpson is the only player in NFL history to break the 2,000 yard barrier in a single 14-game season. O.J. Simpson gained 143 yards per game in his record-breaking season, while Dickerson only gained 131 yards per game in his. So, the answer depends on whether you are interested in total yards or yards per game."

"6","Who is the most famous woman athlete of all time?","And what sport was she famous for?","Historically I believe it would be  Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who was a golfer and olympic track star.\n\nAnswers.com's bio says: "" Mildred 'Babe' Didrikson Zaharias was voted the outstanding woman athlete of the century in a 1950 Associated Press poll. Though she gained her greatest professional fame as a golfer, she rivalled Jim Thorpe in her remarkable ability to excel at nearly any sport. She began as a basketball All-American, then won two track and field golds at the 1932 Olympics. Next she turned professional and began touring the country, exhibiting her prowess in track, swimming, tennis, baseball, and even billiards. In 1935 Zaharias took up golf and excelled at that, too, winning 82 tournaments in a 20-year career. She was only 42 when she died of cancer in 1956."""
"2","Could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past?","In much the same way that a a radio telescope 'sees' past events, could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past?","In a sense, any microphone is picking up sounds from the past, due to the speed of sound. This is similar to what you mentioned with radio telescopes.\n\nThe main differences are 1) velocity -- light moves at about 1 foot per nanosecond while sound moves around 1 foot per 1/1000 second, and 2) that sound moving though a medium diffuses quite rapidly. Something really loud, like thunder, you might hear from 20-30 seconds away. For normal, everyday sounds, the delay won't be more than maybe a few tenths of a second."

"1","What was the first currency ever used?","","The earliest form of currency used was large stones that could be used to get food and meat in exchange - this was during the stone age. Before this there was a barter of goods (so i am not considering it currency)\nLarge stones which were round were considered more valuable since they were more difficult to obtain\n\nThe first recorded accounts of currency date back to 2000 BCE and silver or metal tokens were used to represent a stored value of grain. Also these were useful to ensure that a shipment of commodities arrived with the same goods that were shipped\n\nPaper money was used in the 18th century, but only in the late 18th and through the 19th century was a central monetary authority created in various states that had a virtual monopoly of creating bank-notes that had to be accepted as legal tender everywhere (Prior to this, the one accepting payments could refuse the payment if it was not in a currency which  had been predetermined before the loan or in general use: Note gold and silver were widely used as legal tender)"

"2","what are the materials that can be used to produce laser beam?","what are the differences between the those beams?","Materials that form an inverse energy distribution?  Not quite.\n\nThere are three basic components for getting a laser to work.  First, one needs an excitation source (pumping source) such as a flashlamp, an electrical spark, etc.  Second, one needs a material (the gain medium) which can exhibit what's known as population inversion - the capacity for a material to raise the electron energy level from the lower to the upper energy states.  Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others.  Finally, one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator.\n\nThere are many combinations of pump sources, lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use.  There are solid state (ruby, Nd:YAG), gas (nitrogen, helium-neon) and semiconductor (gallium-arsenide) lasers that come in a variety of wavelengths (colors) to choose from, again, depending on what you want to do with it.\n\nJust a little bit of background: My degree is in Physics, and I've been working in the lasers and electro-optics field for the past 10+ years.

"2","Is there any proven evidence that Mars at some point in the past had microscopic life?","what supports this theory?","The answer to your question is no.  There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date.  We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still, we're not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.  Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas, potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil.    Given our current rate of deepening understanding, we will likely solve this mystery sometime in the next 50 years, but as of now we simply don't have enough evidence to constitute ""proof"""

"5","What is programming?","","Programming is instructing a computer to do something for you with the help of a programming language. The role of a programming language can be described in two ways:\n\n   1. Technical: It is a means for instructing a Computer to perform Tasks\n   2. Conceptual: It is a framework within which we organize our ideas about things and processes. \n\nAccording to the last statement, in programming we deal with two kind of things:\n\n    * data, representing ``objects'' we want to manipulate\n    * procedures, i.e. ``descriptions'' or ``rules'' that define how to manipulate data. \n\nAccording to Abelson and Sussman ([ABELSON, 1985, 4,])\n\n    ``.....we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combinign simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:\n\n    primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities with which the language is concerned\n\n    means of combination, by which compound expressions are built from simple ones, and\n\n    means of abstraction, by which compound objects can be named and manipulated as units.''\n\nA programming lanugage should both provide means to describe primitive data and procedures and means to combine and abstract those into more complex ones.\n\nThe distinction between data and procedures is not that clear cut. In many programming languages, procedures can be passed as data (to be applied to ``real'' data) and sometimes processed like ``ordinary'' data. Conversely ``ordinary'' data can be turned into procedures by an evaluation mechanism."

"1","If God is both all loving and all powerful, how can he/she/it allow suffering to exist?","Please, none of those ""it's beyond our understanding"" answers.  I want some real answers here!","Frankly, the answers thus far show a complete lack of understanding of basic theodicy and even the Christian Bible.  Assuming that – as a Christian – you buy into Job’s tale as at least allegorical, then there is acknowledgement that you cannot know the mind of G-d.  To attempt to do so is itself blasphemous.  To attempt know the mind of G-d is to be G-d, yet we are admonished when G-d responds to Job, not with an explanation for Job's suffering but rather with a question: Where was Job when G-d created the world?\n\nAnd it was said:\nJob 40 \n1 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job and said:\n2 Shall a reprover contend with the Almighty? He who reproves God, let him answer it.\n3 Then Job answered Jehovah and said:\n4 Behold, I am vile! What shall I answer You? I will put my hand to my mouth.\n5 Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further.\n6 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said:\n7 Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will question you; and you make Me to know.\n8 Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?\n9 And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His?\n10 Adorn yourself with majesty now, and with grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor;\n11 pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea, look on everyone who is proud, and bring him down low;\n12 look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, and trample the wicked in their place;\n13 hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.\n\nKnow that to contend to know G-d is to set yourself above him.\n\nA previous answer blasphemed: “G-d desires that we do not suffer, but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.”\n\nAnd also: “But there is a plan to alleviate the suffering. And that is through redemption.”\n\nLies.  \n\nAnd “John 3:16”?!  I think that means “go Broncos.”\n\nAn alternative explanation is the easy one:  there is no G-d.  You either believe that, or you blaspheme in the attempt to understand Him."

"4","Would it seriously affect my chances of getting into college if I don't have a high SAT score?","","Unfortunately, the answer is ""Maybe"".\n\nIf you are trying to get into a top tier school with very selective admissions, then a low SAT/ACT score is virutally a ""kiss of death"".\n\nHowever, if you are looking at most state univerisities, then a low SAT/ACT score is not too bad.  You may have to take a few remedial courses.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT!!  A low SAT/ACT score WILL NOT stop you from going to college.  And, in the long run, it really doesn't matter very much where you get your undergraduate degree (as long as the college/university is ""regionally accredited"").  For example, a degree in education from ANY regionally NCATE accredited school will get you hired as a teacher.  An engineering degree from ANY ABET accredited school will get you hired as an engineer.\n\nEnjoy"

"2","Why do we get hiccups?","","Hiccups are sudden, involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle. As the muscle contracts repeatedly, the opening between your vocal cords snaps shut to check the inflow of air and makes the hiccup sound.

"5","What are the best ways to incentivise people to answer questions here?","Appeal to their ego? wallets? sense of belonging? or something else?","I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn ""incentivizes"" people to answer questions. And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased.\n\nSee my answer to the question, ""Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?"":\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767\n\nOn the issue of the term ""incentivize""--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process. To attempt to use softer language to describe something that is inherently cold, calculating, and opportunistic (though not necessarily bad or wrong) would constitute euphemism, and would be both misleading and dangerous."

Officially there was only one Virginia to name at the time, but I think we're looking to count how many states are named after kings or queens today, in the here and now, right?

Georgia - Latin or English - After King George II of England  Louisiana - French - After King Louis XIV of France  Maryland - English - After Queen Henrietta Maria of England  North Carolina - Latin - After King Charles II of England  South Carolina - Latin - After King Charles II of England  Virginia - Latin or English - The virgin country (or country of the virgin), after Queen Elizabeth I of England  West Virginia - Latin or English - The western transmontane, counties of Virginia.

"4","Should cell phones and PDAs be allowed in school?

"7","How do you bring up the salary subject during an interview if the interviewer didn't bring it up?","","Large companies usually have an HR person coordinating the interview for the hiring manager. In such a situation, its better to bring up the question with the HR person. After the first round of interviews, if you are being called back for further interviews, then I think this is a good time to bring it up with the recruiter. \n\nIf there is no recruiter involved, then in my opinion you should not bring up the compensation question till you get the sense that you are being seriously considered. The exception in my mind is that if you are trying to make some decisions/choices while interviewing for multiple positions then you can candidly bring it up after your first interview is done."
"8","What is Indie genre?","","The basic answer is indie (or independent) music is music that is released on smaller labels that operate independently from the mainstream music business.\n\nBut more often ""indie"" refers to a specific genre of contemporary music that is based on combining aesthetics of classic rock, punk, garage and art rock.  I first heard the term indie rock starting to get used in the late 80s to early 90s to describe the music that was popular on college radio stations at the time.  I don't think the definition has changed much since then, but the types of music that fit in this umbrella have become more diverse, both in style and popularity."

By law, you can request 1 copy of your credit history every year from each of the three credit history companies at  www.annualcreditreport.com\n    I suggest you stagger your requests to each of them i.e. request experian first then 4 months later request another report from transunion, and another 4 months later from equifax. this way you get a free report every 4 months. \n\n3. dispute anything that is wrong (most common: credit cards forget to tell the credit history guys that you closed your account or paid all your loans in full)\n\n4. when online, try to use virtual credit numbers to make the purchases. this facility is available for citicard customers, and maybe amex. the virtual numbers are good only for 1 use, and useless after that. so if someone steals that, it is useless.\n\n5. when buying something offline, save your receipts, and make sure your statement is accurate. (a favourite scam is to charge maybe 50cents on a statement, that way you dont notice it, but a scammer who charges 10,000 card owners 50cents a month can make $5000 a month no sweat -- and you dont even realize it)\n\n6. also dont forget to shread any credit card solicitations you dont plan to use."

It's a recently developed concept of the general public categorizing information according to what's most useful for the masses, and is considered in opposition to the sometimes more formal classification systems created by an entity such as the Library of Congress or Yahoo!.\n\nFolksonomies are often implemented using tags.  An advantage of tags over a hierarchical taxonomy is that it's easy to apply multiple tags to a single item, rather than having to decide which category to place the item in."
"5","Are Wireless Networks Secure?","","Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or ""snoop"" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or ""inject"" unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now ""secure enough"" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or ""encrypt"" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!"

"4","What makes a teacher want to leave their profession?","","It seems like a lot of factors contribute to teacher attrition (leaving the profession). But apparently new teachers are most likely to abandon ship.\n\nAccording to a 1986 survey, more than 2/3 of all beginning teachers will have left during their first four years of teaching and 40-50% of them will leave during the first seven years of their career. (Huling-Austin, 1986).\n\nThese are some factors likely most likely to affect the attrition of new teachers:\n\n1) Beginning teachers are unable to cope with teaching problems like discipline, difficulties with parents, and lack of sufficient or appropriate teaching materials.\n\n2) Beginners are often given the most difficult teaching assignments. \n\n3) Novice teachers often receive little or no support after leaving the university and find that their teacher education programs ill-prepared them for the realities of teaching.\n\nOther factors, such as salary, affect attrition rates, but perhaps the fact that beginning teachers lack adequate support and resources to handle such a large responsibility (basically parenting your students) is where the responsbility lies."
"3","How do I tone my butt? What's the best exercise for butts?","","Where do you live?  I have been taking a class called ""Core Fusion"" for almost a year now, and it has been the most effective thing I've done in terms of toning my body up (all over, not just butt).  It is offered at Exhale Spa, which has locations in Boston, New York, Chicago, Venice (CA) and Santa Monica - and I believe they'll be opening up a Dallas location in 2006.  \n\nIf you are not near an Exhale, yoga has a lot of postures that will help you tone your butt muscles (maybe check out a local gym or studio?).  So does Pilates (which I'm not really a fan of - I find it boring).  \n\nThere are also the old ""standbys"" of squats and lunges (you can get added benefit by integrating props or machines - i.e. do the lunges or squats on the Smith Machine - the one that has the bar with adjustable weights that you square on the back of your shoulders while doing the exercises, or stand with your back to the wall, place a physioball behind you and roll it up and down the wall with your back as you squat).  One important thing to remember about squats and lunges is not to let your knees go forward of your ankles - that puts a lot of strain on your knees and sets you up for unpleasant injuries.  \n\nIf you go to the gym, some of the weight machines they should have can be effective butt toners - like the leg/hamstring curl machines."
"6","Can I use 26"" mountain bike rims for my cyclocross-frame bike?","It's my first time building a bike from scratch and I found some wheels I really like but I was told that they aare 26"" rims and not the standard 700c clinchers I think I need. Would it still be compatible with my aluminum cyclocross frame?","The 26"" wheels won't work. They're slightly smaller in diameter than a 700c wheel–that's what cyclocross frames are built to take. Back in the late 80's/early 90's you could get clamp-on cantilever brake mounts from Moots, but I don't know that they make those anymore. And regardless, if you were to do that, you'd also be dropping the overall height of your bike. This in turn would mean that your bottom bracket would also be lower to the ground. That's counterproductive in terms of cyclocross applications, where you want a higher bottom bracket than you would on a road bike (for clearence issues).\n\nThere's some good general information on equipment on Dave Carr's Cross Page (listed below). Good luck!"

"4","Which part-time MBA program will add value to a software developer with 15 years experience?","","Wow.  There are some pretty negative answers in this thread.\n\nPick a good program.  Pick a highly rated program.  The brand *is* part of the value of an MBA, and frankly, the lower rated programs aren't that much cheaper.  Here in the Bay Area, Haas (Berkeley) has a great ranking (top 5 in part time rankings, recently been in the top 10 for full time).  I am currently a student at Haas (in the PT program), and I can't understand why people would pick a different program in this region.  Stanford, unfortunately, doesn't have a part time program.\n\nI agree with the previous poster who said you need to have an idea what you want out of it.  Go in with a plan on how you're going to get value from the MBA, and just from being a student.  I'm amazed at the access I get just by being an MBA student.  It opens a lot of doors.  But you need to be very goal directed to get this value.\n\nI can't agree with the person who said networking in a PT program isn't good.  As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now.  Comparing notes with some co-workers who are recent graduates from the FT programs at Wharton, Stanford, Columbia, it's clear that my network is broader, more active, and more useful right now than their networks.\n\nSo - to your actual question.  If you are in the Bay Area, pick Berkeley (I'm biased, obviously).  Really, you can gain a lot of value from any part time MBA program.  But talk to people, figure out how *you* can gain value from an MBA, and then go from there."
"2","Are humans still evolving?","Seems the vast majority of humans live long enough to procreate.  Is natural selection dead (or sleepy)?  If not, what are the attributes that are being selected for/against in humans these days?","Evolution is ever-present as always. You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\n\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\n\nIs average height an example of this? It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average, and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example. It should be noted however that who we think is desirable for sex is very culturally dependent and may not lead to the best long-term (breeding) prospects for an individual conceived to those parents."

"5","what is a double layer DVD burner?","","Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data.  This is because they are pressed (as opposed to burned) dual-layer DVDs (also called DVD-9).  The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store  up to 4.7 gigabytes.  This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD.  Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.\n\nSo a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd#Technical_information"

"7","How do you negotiate a job offer?","","At the point you have a job offer, you are in the best position to negotiate.  This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process, and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position.  Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected, and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests.\n\nThe other factor is the overall job market.  In today's market, where employment is picking up in many sectors you're in a good spot to negotiate.\n\nNow the right place to phrase things is to describe competitive offers (hopefully you'll have some) in terms of their relative advantage.  If one of your alternative offers pays more, you can allude to this vaguely.  Even if they do not, you can allude to the relative advantages (the types of challenge, the convience of the commute etc).  This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash).\n\nUnless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area), you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%.  Put this out there with clear timelines for when they need to respond, and other forms you might accept (signing bonus, trading-up level/rank, etc).\n\nYou should stay professional throughout the process, even if your offer is rejected.  Employers know that this is the right time to bring these things up, so don't worry about burning bridges by putting a request out there at this stage.\n\nOk.  Hope that helps!"

""Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now so I can get the actresses while they're this age.""    Tarantino's idea is an excellent one, and in tune with the ambitious nature of the Kill Bill project itself. however, it is important to note that Tarantino is well known for announcing interest in projects that could never see the light of day, so there is no certainty that this will come about."

"3","As a novice runner, how many weeks/months do I need to properly train for a marathon?","","The answer, of course, varies for each individual depending on how fit you are, how often do you train and what your goals are. \n\nIf you are very aggressive, you can do it in 28 weeks. Start by walking, slowly, for a\nmile. Two days later, walk 1.5 miles. Every other day, increase the distance by half a mile until you get to 3 miles. Rest your muscles on the ""off"" day. Hold that distance on Tuesday and Thursday, while increasing by one additional mile on your weekend session (either Sat or Sun).\n\nOnce the long walk reaches 10 miles you can cut the distance in half every other weekend, increasing the long one by 2 miles each time. When the long one\ngets to 18 miles, you can do it every third weekend, covering 8-9 miles on the ""short"" weekends.\n\nAfter about the third week of training, insert a one min jog into your runs, after 4 min of walking. If this feels fine after 2 weeks, drop to 3walk/1jog. After 3 more weeks, drop to 2-1. If all goes well after another 3 weeks or so you could go to 1-1 during the week, and 2walk/1jog on the long run.\n\nFind the ratio that works best for you, that will leave you feeling strong at the end, and recovering fast from these long ones. The pace for all of\nthese should be very, very slow."

"3","How can I cure my hiccups?","","This is to expand on another person's answer, which was correct but missing some important steps or explanation.  This cure is a bonafide medical and scientific cure.  The get rid of hiccups, you must deprive oxygen from the muscle that is causing hiccups. No oxygen to that muscle, it can't burn energy, no energy, no hiccups.\n\nSo what needs to be done is to simulate DROWNING.  We must trick the body to think it is drowning.  This will cause it to divert oxygen from unimportant parts of the body, like that muscle causing hiccups, to more important parts like the heart, the brain, the organs, etc.  \n\nSo...take a glass of water, slowly exhale.  Pinch your nose.  Take about 5 or 6 sips of water (or more until you can't take it any longer) from the glass...making sure you are taking in WATER ONLY. Do NOT sip any air along with the water.  Stop.  \n\nHold your breath for a few seconds, and inhale slowly. The hiccups should disappear. If not repeat.  \n\nI have found this works 90% of the time.  It only fails to work if there really is something stuck in your throat that really needs to be expelled by hiccups or coughing, or drinking lots of water."

"5","What is Visual Basic?","","Visual Basic is a programming language and software development environment created by Microsoft in the 1990s primarily to make it easy for developers to create client applications on Windows. It featured an way to easily create graphical user interfaces by drawing windows and controls on the screen, and an event-driven paradigm that made it easy to attach code to meaningful events in the lifetime of an application (such as a button click).\n\nThe language was adapted to the Web with a variant called VBScript, and embedded into Microsoft Office and other applications with another variant called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Around the time of Windows 98's release, it became possible to create scripts written in VBScript to run on the Windows desktop.\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft introduced a new unified framework for software development called .NET. At that time Visual Basic was thoroughly revised and renamed to Visual Basic .NET. This version of the language added some capabilities, but dropped others, and was incompatible with previous versions of the language, leading some to complain that it should be been released as a separate language with a different name. Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel."

"2","Why are the Dutch so tall?","","As a dutchman, and someone who's 6'4"" I should be able to answer this one.\n\nSpecifically though there actually has been a fair amount of research around this, the average height of the dutch are indeed abover average and I've heard claims of it being ""the tallest nation in the world"".\n\nThe average dutchman is about 6'1"" (4"" taller than the avg american)\n\nResearch shows it to be a combo of genetics, disease prevention, diet (dairy, etc.) , average wealth & wellbeing, as well as the psychosocial wellbeing.. all affecting height.\n\nSo to summarize: drink your milk, get your shots, be happy and grow grow grow..oh and a bit of genetics.\n\nFrom a research report:\n\nGenetic factors are evident in marked regional differences between the north and the south of the Netherlands. In the north, boys are on average 50 mm taller and girls 20 mm taller. The populations are relatively stable, and Frisians are genetically more Scandinavian, whereas Limburgers have southern European roots. However, although boys in Turkish and Moroccan immigrant groups are about 95 mm shorter than ethnic Dutch, they are taller than in their countries of origin. Researchers point to the increase over the past 30 years in the amount of protein in the diets of the Dutch, the world's highest consumers of dairy products. \n\nMiranda Fredriks, one of the researchers in the recent study, emphasised other health and hygiene factors as well as diet--for example, the Netherlands has a 95% vaccination rate among children.\n\nLastly it's the healthcare system and wealth, every dutch person has access to the healthcare system and overall the dutch are fairly well off to being with. It's been shown that wealth has a direct impact on height.."

"6","Should the Sharks trade Evgeni Nabokov?","","In short, no. \n\nIf they trade him now they will see minimal returns on a trade. They are dealing from a weak position. Should Nolan Schaefer get a shot? Yes. \n\nNabokov should be given a chance to rest, start Nolan for a couple of games and then get him back in there. I believe he will be able to snap out of this funk, but trading him now would be the absolute worst time for them to trade him in terms of what they could get in return."
"2","Can animals really predict earthquakes?","","There was a PBS program 'Nature', just aired a couple of weeks ago, about whether animals can predict nature disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. Whether animals can predict earthquakes is not conclusive. But there's a scientist in Berkeley (forgot his name) claimed he had predicted earthquakes accurately in the last few decades. What he used was simply newspaper ads on missing pets. He said normally you'd see about 10-15 missing pets ads, but before earthquakes, the missing pets ads would increase. His theory is contraversial, but it's worth a try. You may want to test that theory. \n\nThe program also mentioned about the terrible tsunami in Asia over a year ago. It mentioned none of the animals got harmed since they 'knew' the waves were coming and escaped from the disaster. \n\nOne theory is that animals can hear low frequency sound from beneath the earth, like grinding sound of moving rocks. \n\nAnyway, you'll find some interesting programs on PBS stations."

"6","Who is the best soccer player in the world? Accordingly to FIFA and accordingly to general audience?","","the last (2004) FIFA best player of the world is Ronaldinho (playing at barcelona, don't confuse with Ronaldo, playing at Real Madrid). Read the official FIFA interview with him at http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/awards/gala.html\n\nAlso, TODAY (november 28, 2005), Ronaldinho is going to receive the ""Ballon D'Or"" (golden ball), prize created by the french magazine French Football --http://www.francefootball.fr/ -- in 1956 to distinguish the best player of the european leagues. The complete list of winners of this prize is at: http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/ballon_or/index_bo.html\n\nNow, the general audience... this is tough, since there are many players that could be the best at any time (henry, lampard, ronaldo, ronaldinho, zidane -getting older, though-, kaká, eto'o, ...). But truth is that, at this moment of the season, Ronaldinho is one step above the rest, and playing in the current best team (barcelona) helps him a lot."

"3","In the quest for dazzling teeth, how harmful are teeth whitening strips?","","Depends on your teeth.  I used Crest Whitestrips for a time, and they worked really well (I definitely noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth).  However, they irritated my gums to the point where my dentist told me to stop using them and they made my teeth super sensitive to cold and hot (i.e. eating ice cream or drinking tea was painful).  I've never done the laser whitening/Brite Smile, but I've seen those treatments work wonders for folks who have (they are not cheap though).  I would advise trying the strips (making sure to abide by the time guidelines) - you will like the effects of them (they do really work) and if they don't bother your teeth/gums, you should be able to continue use."
"7","Can someone *simply* explain what a stock ""short"" is?","","Shorting a stock (or selling short) ideally works like this:\n\nWhen you think a stock is going to go down...\n1. You borrow shares of stock you don't own, typically from your broker.\n2. You sell those shares at today's price.\n3. You wait for the stock to go down.\n4. You buy the same number of shares back at a lower price.\n5. You return the borrowed shares.\n6. You pocket the difference between the buying and selling price.\nSteps 1 & 5 are actually done automatically when you issue a short sale order with a broker.\n\nThe advantage of shorting is that you can make money when stocks are going down.  (With a normal stock purchases, you only make money if the stock goes up.)\n\nThe disadvantage is that in theory, you could lose an unlimited amount of money.  For example, if the stock goes up to five times its original value, you've just lost four times your investment.  (With a regular stock purchase, the most you can lose is the amount you originally invested.)"
"2","Is there a cure for malaria?","","There are several means of successfully treating malaria if contracted, yet malaria is still one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developing world.  The reason is that most of these people are too poor to afford even basic preventative measures like bednets (which keeps malarial misquitoes from biting children in their sleep).\n\nBednets are important step to reducing the impact of malaria, because it is much more expensive to treat malaria once it is contracted than it is to prevent it via bednets, removing standing water, etc.\n\nThere are some efforts to find cheaper alternative treatments as well, including one promising one that comes from Chinese herbal medicine. \n\nhttp://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/11/26/health.malaria/\n\nI've also attached a CDC (center for disease control) article that describes some of the anti-malarial drugs currently being used."

"4","Any learning center that offers Personalized tutoring programs in Portland?","","The answer above is a great idea.  Of course, this will only work if you don't mind non-person to person tutoring.\n\nI would contact your local high schools and see if there are any tutors that will tutor your kid.  It might help both the high school student (elective credit) and your kid (because young kids look up to high school students).\n\nNewspapers are always advertising people looking for work such as nannies, care-takers, and yes...even tutors.\n\nI would try the high schools first.\n\nHere are a list of tutorint centers in the Portland area:\nhttp://www.anysubject.com/portland-tutors.asp\nhttp://portland.craigslist.com/lss/\nhttp://www.mindsinmotiontutoring.com/"

"10","What does Sarbaines Oxley compliant mean?","I see many firms advertising that they assist with ""Sarbaines Oxley compliance"".  Can you explain the legislation and who is affected?  How does one become ""Sarbaines Oxley compliant""?","The Sarbanes-Oxley act was sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley, and is a response to the auditing scandals surrounding Enron, WorldCom, and others.  Essentially it aims to protect investors by requiring public companies to adhere to certain standards around auditor independence, information integrity, and greater financial disclosure.\n\nFrom an IT perspective S-Ox compliance revolves around preserving information and ensuring that the systems that maintain financial records are capturing all the correct data.  Of course, S-Ox compliance can be rather complex and counterintuitive, so there are plenty of consultants who earn a living by making companies S-Ox compliant, as it is a requirement for all public companies."

The Pro V1 for me is the best ball out there in terms of providing durability, distance and control. I've also used Nike and Top Flight and always come back to the Pro V1. But, the real answer is how the ball reacts to your swing and game. I recommend playing a few rounds with different brands."

"9","What is the difference between dating and in a relationship?","","The difference is the level of commitment. ""Dating"" connotes a casual thing, not necessarily exclusive. When a person says ""I'm dating Bill"" instead of ""Bill is my boyfriend"", you can probably guess the relationship is relatively new and no commitment has been made. \nWhen you've decided you're in a relationship, you'll probably start referring to one another as boyfriend/girlfriend. You'll introduce each other to your close friends and family. You'll likely spend a LOT of time together, and may take it for granted that you'll see each other certain nights and weekends. Depending on your lifestyle, you may agree to make your relationship exclusive and stop seeing other people.\nIf you're uncomfortable discussing taking things to ""the next level"" you're probably just dating, and not quite ready for a relationship."

"10","Why in the House of Commons does the P.M. often say ""I refer the hon. gentleman to the answer I gave earlier""?","","Another reason is that the P.M.'s responses are scripted in advance, where at all possible.  Questions from the House--especially from the opposition--are designed to get him off his game and distract him from the prepared text, in the hope of making him look bad.  (A similar game is played by many television correspondents: ""If the interviewee gives a pat answer, ask the question ten more times.  Play only the most emotive response."")  By referring the questioner back to the earlier, prepared answer, the P.M. short-circuits this tactic.  Stilted, but effective."

"4","Why is SAT important?","","Most colleges and universities use your SAT score as a factor in determining admissions. While it may be possible to get a waiver in some cases, your chances at consideration are much greater if you take the SAT. \nAnother reason to take the SAT is for financial aid consideration. Grants and scholarships, especially those run by the school or private organizations, often take SAT scores along with grade point average into account."

""Reggie"" turned out to be a disaster!).\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the name ""Reinhard"" is composed of the ancient Germanic words ""ragina"" ('advice') and ""harti"" ('hard', 'strong'), meaning: ""strong in giving advice"" = ""the knowledgeable"".\n\nOh, so a great name for ""Yahoo! Q&A"" could also be ""Yahoo! Reinhard""?!","According to this page in the French wikipedia, Reinhard comes from Regin + Hard (strong advice as you mention)\n\nhttp://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Renart\n\nInterestingly, the page goes on to say that the word ""renard"" (French for ""fox"") comes from Reinhard! Reinhard was the name of the fox (originally ""goupil"" in French) in a famous story ""Reynard the fox"", but due to the popularity of the fox character, the French name for fox became ""renard"" instead of ""goupil"".\n\n""Reinhard  : Voir Renard pour le sens.

"5","what is the most popular programming laguage in use today?","","This is a tough one, and no doubt a potential debate point in most cases.   I would really doubt that C# has any real future.  \n\nJava, on the other hand, is written in C.  Most modern development platforms have a foundation in C.  \n\nIf this question is to choose a language path for school, I think either Java or C is fine.  Though I would say that you will become a better programmer if you have a more detailed understanding of what is ""under the hood"".  In that case C (and a bit of assembly isn't bad to at least take a look at).  The more higher-level you go, the less you can ultimately do."
"2","What are the odds of life on another planet?","","Answers to this question can vary greatly, but a good framework to think about it is the Drake Equation.  Developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, it runs through some of the key factors that will effect the viability of life on other planets.  As we learn more about extrasolar planets and astrobiology, we are getting better limits on some of the parameters in the equation, but especially when it comes to the terms where we look for intelligent life that can last long enough to contact other species, we have very little data to go on.\n\nSo when it comes down to the last few terms you need to take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you are simply talking about life, I think recent discoveries have made the likelihood very high.  The discovery of many extrasolar planets including some that are closer to Earth size means that there are specific places we can point to where life may have formed or be forming.  Even in stranger systems that feature planets several times Jupiter's mass, it is possible that a terrestrial satellite of such a large planet could harbor the right conditions for life.\n\nIt's a fun thing to work through the Drake equation yourself.  Since the last few terms are more subjective (at least until we get more data), it's fun to play with it and see where you stand.\n\nThe best guess that scientists have put forward right now is:\n\nN = 10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 × 1×10-7 × 0.01 × 67 = 2.211×10-7 = 0.0000002211\n\nwhere N is the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations that might come to communicate with us in a year.  \n\nTo get the number of planets that reach a point of harboring life (not intelligent) in a year, we just take the first 4 terms:\n\n10 × 0.5 × 2 × 0.33 = 3.3\n\nSo about 3.3 new planets reach the point where life forms per year."
"9","What is your opinion on online dating?","","It works.  I met my bf of almost 3 years through online dating.  That doesn't mean I didn't meet alot of incompatible people.  I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him.  \n\nOnline dating is just another way to meet people, but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people.  If you're banking on it working, it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience.  It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead, decide to just have fun with the experience, regardless of the outcome.  Yes, even a bad date can be fun.  Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends.\n\nI find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work.  Then, it's up and down for awhile depending on who you come into contact with.  When it doesn't feel fun anymore, TAKE A BREAK.  Come back in a few months.  Change your profile to reflect how you're feeling.  \n\nIt's important that you feel good about yourself or you won't attract the people you want because who wants to be with someone who's down on themselves?  Online dating is really a reflection of how you're  feeling.  When you feel good about yourself, your online experience improves.  When you feel bad, it tends to be a not so good experience.  \n\nI was about to pull my dating profile because I found I was meeting lots of people through offline methods.  However, my friend pointed out that it wasn't costing me anything (financially or emotionally) if I just left my profile up.  \n\nI thought she made a good point, so I decided to rewrite my profile one last time and put it out there.  When I rewrote it this time, I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me.  Instead, I wrote a profile that reflected exactly how I felt and who I was at that moment.\n\nAnd then, I started to meet interesting people.  Shortly thereafter, I met my bf and things have been going well since."

For people who've been there before, is it worth it?","Whether any party would be worthy flying cross-country for is definitely up to you, but as far as company parties go, I think Yahoo's are tops.\n\nThey go all out in so many ways.  The bands are impressively big (for a party) like this year's Earth, Wind, and Fire (http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:aq6jtr59klox), there is a huge variety of food and alcohol (including ice sculpture martini luges), and lots of other activities (gambling, full-body video games).  \n\nBut despite all that, your enjoyment will probably be determined more by how much you enjoy being around your co-workers (if they're going), your date, and/or how long you can enjoy gambling/dancing.\n\nThe last two parties really really impressed me, but I enjoyed the second one much more because my date and I shared a great enthusiasm for the party and dancing.\n\nIt doesn't look like last year's photos links work anymore :("

"3","why does the bird flu considered to be such a frightening disease?","I seem that the entire world is dealing with it- what makes it different then other epidemic diseases?","The 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year, vaccines for ""regular"" human flu are in short supply as well.\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you're just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days. When the flu strikes more vulnerable people, like the elderly and very young babies, it can cause respiratory problems and even kill them."
"4","What can be done to lower the dropout rate in High Schools?","","To curb the dropout rate, the National Dropout Prevention Center advocates the ""implementation of alternative strategies based on the principle of continuous improvement, in place of policies supporting student grade retention"".\n\nIn other words, the organization believes that the qualifier of a meaningful education shouldn't solely be based on grades, but on individual performance. \n\nEach learner begins at a different level emotionally, socially, and cognitively, and behaviorally. And because all of these factors play a role in learning, the same standard shouldn't apply to every student. \n\nThe NDPC thinks that more dropouts could be prevented if each child was assessed as an invidividual and their progress was weighed on their individual needs, not based against every other student.\n\nOne of the best educational strategies they recommend is service-learning. This is a theory based on the connection of hands-on experience and academic learning that also incorporates service to the community. Many learners have shown they can grasp concepts better and have greater success through experiential learning instead of the traditional textbook/lecture/text based learning.\n\nhope this helps!"

Earlier when you did not have the router, were you entering the login/password to connect to internet? If so, you have to configure your cable/dsl modem to host the login/password. For SBC DSL modem you can do it by http://192.168.1.0/ and there is a option available in ""advanced configuration"" to do that.\n3. Did you connect the ethernet cable from the cable/dsl modem to the \n    WAN port of the router?\n4. Are you getting the Dynamic IP assigned by the router? Check it by Start->Run->Cmd->ipconfig.

"4","How can we improve the quality of the teachers in high schools?","","hi,\n\nThis question is of particular interest to me because I have been interested in education reform for some time. I'm a believer that the quality of education has a lot to do with the quality of the teachers. To have quality teachers, many different initiatives should be put into place. \n\nThere are several areas to focus on improving teachers:\n\n1) preparation and credentialing- some states have focused on improving teacher education programs and raising the passing score on qualifying exams like the PRAXIS.\n\n2) induction and retention- it's well known that the teaching profession has a high burnout rate. it's not suprising. they're essentially expected to raise our society's children and many times spend more time when them than the parents do. that's why some states have instituted better support programs for new teachers. assigning each new teacher a teacher-mentor and having a supportive adminstration that encourages teacher autonomy and professional development are a few ways to help retain new teachers.\n\n3) professional development- states should encourage the professional development of their teachers. this doesn't just mean that they raise the expectations for the classes they take, it means that they tie these developments to compensation as well. one way in which states have given teachers incentives to grow professionally is by instituting national board certification programs. a teacher who passes this test gets a raise as well as the privelege of teaching in any other state w/o additional requirements.\n\n4) accountability- it's a problem when non-performing teachers are allowed to stay because of tenure. while it's important to ensure teacher accountability, it seems that some states see this area as a panacea for generating good teachers. it's not. the other factors are equally important, if not more so. to weed out deadbeats, you just have to nurture a better teaching staff.\n\n5) fair compensation- obviously, this is very important.\n\nhope this helps?"
"8","what was Hitchcock best movie?","in which movie he had introduced more new techniques the any of his movies?","Generally, film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious, but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes, too.\n\nNotorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. Essentially, this is the plot device that everything seems to be hinging upon while the story is doing something else (much sneakier) in the background. In Notorious, the McGuffin is (are) the wine bottles full of uranium.\n\nI tend to think that Vertigo is his best because it's just so damn unbelievable and over-the-top but he still pulls it off. Jimmy Stewart was never better in his whole career and the cinematography, music and mood is just amazing.\n\nOther (not yet mentioned) great Hitchcock films that you must see would be:\n\n1. Early Period: The Thirty-Nine Steps (1939), The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train\n2. Middle-Period: The Trouble with Harry (very funny), Suspicion, Rebecca\n3.

Somebody will inevitably plug in the wrong device, and putting a 110v device on 220v can be pretty nasty. Dual voltage devices which are popular today (largely due to power semiconductors which make them inexpensive), didn't exist when plugs were designed!\n\nPolitical: Many ex-colonies of Britain were trying to shake off British influence as far as possible, which probably was a factor in picking different system for power device standards, among others."
"7","Should I rent or buy?","I live in an area with very high real estate prices. I can afford to buy, but I'm wondering if I should just rent and save a bunch of money.","It depends on what you mean by ""save a lot of money"".  If you are trying to save money over a period of time, it depends.  Over the long haul you might save money by buying, since you'll end up owning the property and could sell it and recover your investment.  You might even make money by buying if you live in an area where the property value is likely to go up over the period of time you might live there.\n\nIf you're trying to save money on a monthly basis, renting is usually cheaper, unless a) you might rent out one or more rooms, thus off-setting your out-of-pocket monthly expenses, or b) you can afford to put down a large down-payment.\n\nLiving in a high-cost area myself, I say ""buy"" if you can afford it.

If they believe in God, remind them of the principles of divine forgiveness. If they're not religious, ask them about their beliefs. Reassure them of their impact on your life. If you're there at their bedside, I assume they've touched you somewhat, somehow.\n\nThis is not a time to hold a grudge. If you have a disagreement with them, try to forgive.

"2","Why is the sky blue?","","The sky is blue due to atmospheric scattering of blue light. Blue photons are the most energetic of the visible light photos, and interact more with the atmosphere as a result. To be clear, all colors get scattered, it s just that blue is affected the most because of it is more energetic.   A related effect happens around sunset. At this time of day, sunlight needs to travel through significantly more air to reach your eyes. The length of air is so long that nearly all the blue and green is scattered away before it reaches you. All that is left is yellows, oranges and reds, some of which reaches your eyes, and the rest scattered in the sky within your view."

Dictatorships are notorious for systemic corruption, and there is little that can be done without coup or significant intervention (or perhaps populist uprising, although you'd be risking your life).  In a democracy, the corruption is of a softer sort, and you may be able to counter-act it via a public interest campaign, or story presented to the news media.\n\nNow if the graft and corruption is within your own heart... that's a real toughie.  It requires a degree of personal strength and conviction to ideals which extend beyond your person.  I think all human beings have the capacity for such strength and compassion, but it requires a willingness to make the hard choices both for yourself and your community."

"2","Explanation for correlated wave function collapse at a distance (Quantum Mechanics)?","I remember from physics class in college that two correlated wavefunctions (e.g., sum of wavefunction spins = 0) can exhibit strange behavior at a distance.  left alone (e.g., without measurement of wavefunctions), each wavefunction (called A & B) has a probability of 50% spin up and 50% spin down.  WavefunctionA (WF_A) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured.  the moment WF_A it is measured, WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability.  i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B, but HOW does this happen.  WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance? I am not looking for explanations like ""satisfies laws of conservation"" ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work.  If the ""weirdness"" i am describing is an artifact of the way i am asking the question (which is what i suspect), explainations there would be appreciated as well.","An equally valid question would be ""what is the mechanism that causes WF_A to collapse when it is measured?""  The schroedinger equation does not predict collapse as a result of any interaction, so it is outside the theory taught in undergraduate classes.  There is no accepted theory (or in my opinion, any reasonable theory at all) as to why measurement causes a selection of a single eigenvalue out some non-eigenstate.  The idea that measurement on one object has ramifications on another object seems more mysterious, but it's not fundamentally different than the idea that measurement causes collapse in the first place.  You won't find a satisfying answer."

"2","Why is the voltage ratinging always a multiple of 11 ?","For household we have 110 V, 220 V.\nFor high voltage lines: 11 KV, 22 KV , 33 KV etc.","110 Volts is nominal and may vary when measured by a voltmeter.  That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles.  The very high voltage there is stepped down using a transformer to supply most houses and businesses with a usable lower voltage.  The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.  Incidentally there may be an additional single wire above all the rest to arrest lightning strikes."

When the ball gets older the shine disappears and the amount of swing is decreased. In reverse swing the bowler keeps one side of the ball shining and one rough.\nDue to air friction the rough side resists the air and the ball moves towards the shining side having less friction on that side.\nSo it will allways move towards the direction of the shine.\nWaqar younis had the habbit of hiding the ball from batsman before its delivery.

But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw, and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth. There must be at least 1.5cm. How can it be less than 4mm? Am I missing something?","The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets (the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth. Your dentist would measure this with a probe.\n\nIf your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). \n\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.\n\nHope this helps!"

"1","Why are the colors of Christmas red and green?  What do these colors symbolize?","","The origin of the popular Christmas colors red and green is speculated to be Italy, since the Italian flag's colors are red, green, and white and most of the Christmas traditions we have were usurped from early Pagan people of the 3rd Century.\n\nIn AD 274, Emperor Aurelian decreed December 25 as natalis solis invicti (""birth of the invincible sun""), a festival honoring the sun god Mithras known as Saturnalia. It had been celebrated by Pagans for centuries, but the emperor moved it to this later date.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Church Fathers likewise set the official date for celebrating the birth of Jesus as being December the 25th.\n\nThe Italians today commemorate Christmas for an entire month. Just as in the days of Pagan Rome with Saturnalia, the period between mid-December and early January is one constant celebration.\n\nRich Nativity scenes and the playing of bagpipes by the zampognari (shepards) are very important to the look and feel of Christmas in Italy."

One of the most used one is phpMVC. \n\nQuoted from their website ""php.MVC implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, and encourages application design based on the Model 2 paradigm. This design model allows the Web page or other contents (View) to be mostly separated from the internal application code (Controller/Model), making it easier for designers and programmers to focus on their respective areas of expertise.\n\nThe framework provides a single entry point Controller. The Controller is responsible for allocating HTTP requests to the appropriate Action handler (Model) based on configuration mappings.\n\nThe Model contains the business logic for the application. The Controller then forwards the request to the appropriate View component, which is usually implemented using a combination of HTML with PHP tags in the form of templates.

"5","How should I encrypt/pw protect my backup files on an external harddrive for easy recovery on any machine?","I share my external drive with my brother (we swap dries with files every month or so to keep backups off-site), and we wanted to know if there was a simlpe solution for password protection that would alow recovery of the files to any computer (assuming the original computer dies and you don't want encryption tied to one machine).","I recently backed up and restored a bunch of files using Roxio's Backup MyPC Deluxe, which was bundled with my copy of Easy Media Creator 7.5.  I don't know how secure the encryption is, but it definitely lets you recover files to any computer.  I would assume that any of the more recognized packages (i.e. Norton/Dantz Retrospect/Ghost) would let you restore files to a different machine as this seems to be a core feature of a backup program."
"10","What is the difference between a state and a nation?","","In political science, a ""nation"" refers to a group of people who feel bound into a single body by shared culture, values, folkways, religion and/or language.  A ""state"" just refers to a patch of land with a sovereign government.  States often coincide with nations (and are called ""nation-states,"" but not always.  States that overlap multiple nations tend to have civil wars; states that exclude parts of a nation tend to have wars with the neighboring state(s) that contain the rest of the nation."

Some possibility of having remote/phone participation on the recording. Prefer answers citing personal experience.","OK - I podcast, just wrapped my 160th show. I use a Plantronics Computer headset. Key is to position microphone 3 fingers away from your mouth, not under your nose. I think it was $14 from Fry's\n\nFor calls, I use a Radio Shack call recorder, plugs in between your phone and headset (phone must have headset jack). Was $24.\n\nProcessing your voice afterwards helps: normalize, use a little reverb, and compress. It makes a big difference, and you dont really need to use hardware to do it. \n\nThats the cheap method. You can spend a lot more and there are huge differences and situations. It depends on where you will be using it, who you will be talking to. Big difference between say a portable , interview show, and/or studio."

This is a tall order that even couples don't always fulfill.\n\nBest friends should appreciate each other's presence, but sometimes people just have different plans/tastes/preferences so that they can't or don't always want to do things together. Best friends should be able to care for each other even though they don't do everything together. The same goes for sharing things."

"9","What is a legal separation?","","Legal separation means that the husband and wife live apart and both are not free to marry since their status has not been changed to unmarried or single person.    From Wikipedia:    ""Legal separation is a possible step towards divorce under United States law. A couple are legally separated if they have successfully petitioned a court to recognize their separation; simply living apart does not constitute separation for these purposes. A period of legal separation constitutes grounds for divorce; the length of that period varies from state to state.    Legal separation does not automatically lead to divorce. The couple may reconcile, in which case they need do nothing in order to remain married. If they do not reconcile, and wish to divorce after the statutory time period, they must file for divorce explicitly."""

"2","why is the earth round?","","The Earth is round because it is a large body, and gravity tends to make large bodies round because that is the gravitational efficient configuration for the matter to be in.\n\nThere are a few reasons you can encounter non-round bodies in space:\n\n1) the object is small (for example asteroids), so it's gravity has less say proportionally on the shape\n\n2) It has experienced a catastrophic collision with a large body\n\n3) It is under very strong rotational or tidal forces\n\n4) It is expelling matter/energy in the form of cosmic jets, nova ejecta, etc."

"5","What is the difference between phishing and pharming?","","Both are entirely made-up terms, of course.  ""Phishing"" generally refers to those e-mail messages that say they're from a bank (or eBay or PayPal or your ISP), but the links actually go to some other web site where the phisher (still pretending to be a bank) asks for your information, and will use it to steal your identity, money, etcetera.\n\n""Pharming"" is another twist on the same thing, using more devious tricks.  In phishing mail you can usually figure out that the site you're about to visit isn't really your bank.  So for ""pharming,"" they'll first trick you into running a program (see ""trojans,"" ""malware,"" ""spyware,"" etcetera) that changes the way your computer looks up domain names.  Then, the pharmer can tell your computer that bank.com is some web server in Russia, and it's much harder to figure out that something's wrong.\n\nThere's some good info about these kinds of scams at http://antispam.yahoo.com/faqs#a13 ."

"7","do i need to pay tax before filing tax return if i sell my ISO stock options this year?","","As you may know, NQSO (non qualifying stock options) have tax withheld at source as soon as you exercise, so theoretically you don't have to pay any estimated tax on NQSO exercises/sales (although see * below).\n\nWith Incentive Stock Options (ISO) though, the situation is quite different.\n\nIt sounds like you plan to exercise and sell your ISOs on the same day.  If so, then this is what's called a ""disqualifying disposition"".  In other words, you will be liable for ordinary income tax on the spread (sale price - exercise price).  \n\nIn general, the IRS wants you to pay tax in the quarter in which the related income is earned.  So you theoretically should pay the estimated tax at your standard income tax rate in the same quarter you exercise and sell ISOs.  You do this by filing an Estimated Tax payment.\n\n\nHowever, there is a way to postpone filing these taxes until your normal April next year tax return.     The following information is sourced from See http://www.fool.com/school/taxes/taxes35.htm. \n\n1.  The simplest way is just to suck it up and not worry about paying a penalty for underpayment of taxes.  Depending on how much you think you can earn on your money, and when you were supposed to pay the tax, this may be a win for you (this used to happen a lot during the dotcom/IPO days of 1999-2000).  Be wary though that you probably can't keep doing this year after year without the IRS getting on your case. \n\n2.  Alternatively, you can avoid the underpayment penalty *if* any of the following are true\n\na) you owed no tax at all in the prior tax year (and were a US citizen/resident for all of that year)\n\nb) you expect to owe less than $1000 in tax this year (unlikely, since you're exercising ISOs)\n\nc) your ordinary income tax withholding (e.g. from your wages and/or NQSO exercise) will exceed 90% of this year's tax bill.  This may happen if your ISO exercise/sale is less than around 10% of your total income for the year.\n\nd) your ordinary income tax withholding (from wages and/or NQSO) is greater than 100% of your last year's tax liability and your previous year's Adjusted Gross Income was < $150,000.   If your previous year's AGI was >= $150,000 (lucky you), then you need to pay at least 110% of last year's tax liability in order to avoid a tax underpayment penalty.\n\n\n\nClear?  As mud?\nOption d) is usually the easiest one to satisfy if you're making a large ISO exercise in this year only, particularly if you got a raise this year and are hence paying more taxes than last year anyway.\n\nHowever, you may also want to consider whether you should do an exercise and hold (for 1 year) to pay long term capital gains tax (15%) instead of your ordinary W2 income tax rate (probably 25-35%).  \n\nIf you do, you will *still* be subject to tax this year, due to the dreaded AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax), but you can use that AMT tax liability as a credit for future years when your AMT is less than your ordinary income tax.  However, that's a topic for a whole 'nother question/answer.   \n\n\n* Even with NQSOs, if the amount held at source is less than your eventual tax rate for the year,  you may be subject to tax penalties unless you meet one of the exceptions listed in a) through d) above."
"7","How do I roll my 401(k) over to a traditional IRA?","I have a retirement plan with my former employer and I want to roll it over to a traditional IRA.  What are my other options?","Just go to vanguard.com or any of the brokerage firms (Vanguard usually has the lowest fees), sign up for a rollover IRA account, and follow the directions they give you. It usually involves filling out a form and submitting that to whatever company is managing your old 401(k)."
"7","Is this the end of the housing boom? For October, existing home sales was down while new home sales surged.?","With consumer confidence and new home sales up, it is almost 100% sure that the Feds will raise short term interest rate again in December and likely in January.  Will long term rate move up more?  With current mortage rate, buyer are still willing to pay premium for houses.  Clearly, easy money are still out there.","I think there is a lag in new home sales and the closings in October really were under contract in Aug and September, thus November numbers should be down dramatically even after seasonal adjustment. Rates will undoubtedly go up again at the next meeting, but with the advent of so many new mortgage products (interest only, reverse mortgage, etc.) money is still relatively easy but definitly more risky. I expect volume levels to slow, prices to flatten across most of the US but do not see a big drop in prices unless rates get above 8%."

I want to do either the Part Time MBA or Certification in Mgmt. Which one has more value and what would you recommend for me?","You see, one of the biggest value an MBA will bring is the ""networking"" opportunity. Hence, a part-time MBA with no classroom-based activities will miss this important piece.\n\nIf you want to go for a fully remote-based degree, the Open university is a good option.\n\nColumbia also has a good option for a certificate: you keep taking several courses and after some time you can apply for a certificate in business excellence.\n\nI think both the part-time mba or the certificate are good options if you pick a good school.\n\nIf you can afford going to the campus about twice a month, an executive mba is the best option in my opinion. Chech NYU, Kellog or Columbia."
"7","Would Amazon sell as much stuff if they required California residents to pay tax?","","Their lower sales rate in Washington state would suggest that no, they wouldn't.  I knew quite a few people (even Amazonians) who didn't buy from Amazon due to that factor.  Given a high state sales tax (>8% in both WA and CA), it's the simple economics of a higher price.  Also, WA no longer has a shipping facility, so the convenience of buying online is occasionally outweighed by the delay of obtaining the goods."
"7","I am being harassed by a telemarketing company even though i requested to be not called. Help?","","The federal DNC is your best bet but there will still be a lag between when you register and the telemarketers check the list (4 to 8 weeks at least) \n\nIn the meantime, you're doing the right thing by telling them to put you on their list.  If they call again use your caller ID and pass that info on to the site below.\n\nIt only works if you haven't done any biz with them though.  One transaction with them means they have the right to keep calling you for up to 18 months."

"5","What is the difference between AGP and PCI graphics cards?","","AGP or Accelerated Graphics Port succeeded PCI or Peripheral Component Interconnect as a technology to connect graphics cards to a computer's motherboard. PCI is still used to connect other devices like ethernet and sound cards.\n\nAGP slots provide a dedicated link between the card and the CPU and thus providing faster communication between them.  There are other enhancements as well.  See the source for more.  But the bottom line is that AGP cards perform much better.\n\nBut now AGP is getting phased in favor of PCIe or PCI Express which is even faster and can be used as the bus for all the devices in a machine."

His career spanned from the 1920's to the 1970's. His classic films include ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"", and ""The Birds"". He also hosted two groundbreaking suspense anthology series on television. \n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the influence Hitchcock had on the industry. His showmanship, his cinematography and his approach to suspense are felt to this day, recently in Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot recreation of ""Psycho""."
"4","Where did the term ""I'll be there with bells on"" originate?","I seem to remember reading somewhere that in the old sled/carriage days that if a fellow teamster had to bail you out of trouble, you traditionally gave them your sleighbells as a thank you (or mark of shame?).  Can't find that reference any more.","Direct quote from http://www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm: ""To be somewhere with ""bells on"" refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares. To avoid Indians, they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area. Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins. Hence, ""I'll be there with bells on."" The peddlers' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers, not only for the goods they sold, but also for the news, letters, and messages they carried from the outside world."""

"5","Which is better a Linux operating system over a Windows operating system?","","Your question is the probably wrong question to ask.\n\nWhat you should ask yourself, what applications do I want to run and find a machine that runs it.\n\nBut, if you don't care about what applications you run, Linux is currently more robust and secure than Windows which is very vunerable to Spyware, Trojans, Viruses, etc.\n\nYou have to be a bit of a Geek to be able to manage a Linux system.  On the other hand, you have to be a bit of a wizard to manage a Windows machine...\n\nThe Macintosh runs an OS similar to Linux, but has a nicer frontend on top of it, so I think the Macintosh is a better choice.\n\nBest thing to do is try them out if you can."

"9","how can you cause a toddler to do something that they don't want to do?","","It typically works really well to give them a choice about part of the afair. For example, if they need to take a gross medicine, that's not an option. But it will go down a lot better if they can choose to take it with the blue or the red spoon, or to get a kiss or a hug afterwards. I also try to leave room for ""rewards"". For example, at dinner, the kids can take seconds of whatever they like best after they finish eating. However, I make sure to serve them at least a little bit of everything and make them eat that first, and save some of the stuff they really like for seconds."

Each router is a ""hop"" on the way and each knows where to send your packet next.\nA response from Yahoo goes back through the network in similar way (not necessarily through same networks).\n\nYou may have a router box at home, which usually knows about your home subnet and your ISP subnet.\nCisco builds ""big iron"" routers which are the backbone of the internet."

"9","What's the best age gap between siblings?","","The New England Journal of Medicine recently published a study suggesting that parents should wait 18 to 23 months after a full-term birth before conceiving again.  Interestingly enough, the average age gap between siblings in America is about two and a half years -- which means we must be following this advice!  I personally have two sisters, one 6 years older and the other 11 years older, and we get along famously.  You have to worry about competition between siblings when the age gap is too small; but with families with wide gaps in age between the siblings, you have to worry that they'll be raised almost like one ""only child"" after another.  Best,\n`k."

"8","How do you set-up a personal video recorder without monthly fees?","I figure why pay TiVo or a cable company or a satellite company to use a personal video recorder, after all, it's just a piece of timer software that records data to a hard drive. Just a matter of getting the tv listings, hooking up a home computer and finding the right software for one-time up front cost (something cheap, like $50 and not 300-500 like TiVo/ReplayTV charge you).","Easy, SnapStream, or I think it's now called BeyondTV, there was an article written on it in 2002 on tomsnetworking.com, great article: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/network/20020423/\n\nA little more than $50, but $69.99 ain't bad.

I have a climber's build and tend to like moderately hilly routes.","The main advantage is that the compact crankset gearing is much closer to the high cadence riding that is the current trend in modern cycling.  With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.  The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.  The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\n\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.  The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\n\nA couple things to consider, though.  In order to switch to a double compact, you need to replace a fair number of components, including the bottom bracket, cranks, rear derailleur (optional but highly recommended), front derailleur and possibly your left shifter.  You might be able to get what you want from switching out the cassette on your bike, which is of course a lot cheaper."

My vote's with Ayrton, he had a razor sharp focus that I haven't seen since, and F1 in the early 1990's was much more competitive than it is today."

"7","What exactly is the difference between stock options and stock grants?","","Stock option grants and stock grants are two forms of compensation often offered as incentives in addition to base salary offered to a newly hired employee. This practice is especially common in the high tech industry. \n\nStock options are contracts that allow you to buy or sell specific amount of a particular stock at a certain price within a set period of time. The set price is called the strike price. When you (the stock option holder) make use of your right to buy/sell stock according to the terms of the option, you are exercising the option. Call options are options giving you the right to buy stock. Put options are options giving you the right to sell stock. Employers grant call options to employees. Let's take an example: Let's say you are hired by Google and they offer you options to buy 100 shares of Google stock at $400 within the next 5 years. This stock option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of Google stock at exactly $400 any time within the next 5 years. Let's say it's after four years now. Suppose Google stock is at $300 now, now your options are worthless, because you could buy Google stock in the market for $300, much less than the $400 price offered by your stock option. Now suppose Google stock is at $500 now, then if you exercise your option, you could buy 100 shares at $400. Then you can turn around and sell it on the stock market for the current price of $500, making a $100*100=$10000 profit. So the stock option is basically not worth anything if currently the stock price is lower than your option strike price. But as long as your option has not expired, it's possible that the stock price could go above your strike price and make your stock options worth something.\n\nStock grants are simpler to understand. The employer gives you some shares of stock for free. So let's use the Google example again. Suppose Google hired you and gave you 100 shares in a stock grant. Now you own 100 shares of Google stock. At anytime, you could sell that stock for whatever price it is trading at on the stock market.\n\nStock option and stock grants are usually offered on terms called vesting. That means that you are not given the full amount of options or stock right away, but rather the employer gives it to you over time. A common vesting schedule is vesting over four years, so that you get 1/4 of the stock or options offered after the first, second, third, and fourth year you have been at the company. This is done to give employees an incentive to stay at the company."

There are some LCD ones just coming out that have full-color backlight which should make them actually _better_ than CRTs (according to some Wired article I read, anyhow.)\n\nPersonally, I've been pretty happy with the Dell 24xx monitors - they're under $1k, they have a multitude of inputs, and I think I've only got one stuck pixel (and no dead ones.) You're still going to have to color-correct anyway, but you'd have to do that on _any_ monitor you get. (A good gamma correction curve will solve a multitude of ills.)"

An animal that is preyed upon by many enemies has its eyes out on the sides of its head: each eye with its own field of vision. For example, a cottontail rabbit can see what is above, behind, on either side, and in front of it except what is right before its nose. He probably does not see the clover leaf he eats. Species which are hunted by other animals but which are predators themselves at times, commonly have eyes that are a compromise. A possum's eyes are located at an angle of about 30 degrees with the axis of the body."
"5","What is SAP?","","SAP is the biggest European software company headquartered in Walldorf, Germany. SAP was founded in 1972 as Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung by five former IBM employees in Mannheim, Germany. The acronym was later changed to mean Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung (""Systems, Applications And Products in Data Processing"") but since the Annual General Meeting of 2005, the company's official name is just SAP AG.\n\nAlthough not exactly a household name, SAP is the fourth-largest software company in the world. It ranks after Microsoft, IBM and Oracle in terms of market capitalization. SAP is the largest company in terms of revenue as per latest data, and the largest ERP solution software provider (also in terms of revenue).\n\nSAP's products are in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) business sector. The company's main product is SAP R/3, where the ""R"" stands for real-time data processing, the number 3 relates to the three tier application architecture: database, application server and client - SAPgui is the desktop software for using SAP R/3. The predecessor to R/3 was R/2. Other major offerings include Advanced Planner and Optimizer (APO), Business Information Warehouse (BW), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supplier Relationship Management (SRM), Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS), Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Knowledge Warehouse (KW). The company also offers a new technology platform, named SAP NetWeaver. While its original products are mostly used by larger companies, SAP is now also offering products for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) with SAP Business One and mySAP All-in-One.\n\nMore than 28,000 companies run SAP, at over 91,500 locations. SAP users number over 12 million people in more than 120 countries."

This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. Alpha Test was the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated after the model had been in production a while."""
"8","Why did the Replacements break up?","","Defeated from the lackluster performance of Don't Tell a Soul, Paul Westerberg planned on recording a solo album, but Sire rejected the idea. Consequently, the next Replacements album, All Shook Down, was a solo Westerberg record in all but name. Recorded with a cast of session musicians as well as the band, All Shook Down was a stripped-down, largely acoustic affair that hinted at the turmoil within the band. Chris Mars left shortly after its fall 1990 release, claiming that Westerberg had assumed control of the band; he would launch a solo career two years later. The Replacements toured in support of All Shook Down, with Steve Foley, formerly of the Minneapolis-based Things Fall Down, as their new drummer. Neither the tour nor the album were successful, and the Replacements quietly disbanded in the summer of 1991."

Not just the rate of growth, but the pattern of growth. Examine the crisscrossing spiral seed pattern in the head of a sunflower, for instance, and you will discover that the number of spirals in each direction is invariably two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n2. \nGolden ratio is related to construction of great ancient architectures like Great pyramids in Egypt. \nLink: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit2/unit2.html\n3.\nYou can follow this link for exploring its use in poetry, music, art and now a days it is used for stock market predictions as well.

"4","How did language start?","Especially the English language.. who define the ABCDE....","Language predates the alphabet. The origins of Language are lost to the mists of time. The alphabet as we know it was developed by the Phonecians about 3000 years ago, and modified first by the Greeks, and then the Romans for their own languages before we adopted it from the Romans.\n\nThe origins of the English language specifically date to sometime after 1066 when Willam the Conqueror became King of England. The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French. We kept the grammar of the native Anglo-Saxon tongue while adding huge amounts of French vocabulary.\nThe result is recognizably English, while still sounding very different from what we speak today. It's not until Shakespear's time that Modern English emerged."

I would love to do something special for him, but we are a little limited on funds. What can I do to make this night special? \n\nI would love to hear some ideas from some of you! \nThank you in advance! :)","My favorite times with my loved one is when we actually have time to sit and reflect about what the other one means to us. Going out to eat is traditionally what is done on an anniversary, but I prefer one on one time where there is nobody else around. No strangers talking loudly, no waiters to interrupt, no time wasted in line or in the car.  \n\nIn my opinion, Anniversaries are about each other, and to do that, you've gotta block out the rest of the world.  Here's my recipe for a fabulous anniversary. FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. I'll tell you why in a little bit.\n\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles.  Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\n\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \n\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \n\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\n\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\n\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?"

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\n\nPopulation\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\n\n\nName\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word ""Chelokee"" meaning ""people of a different speech."" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) ""principal people"" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) ""people of Kituhwa."" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\n\n\nLanguage\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\n\n\nSub-tribes\n\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \nLower"

I'll strongly recommend you to check KaplanMedical.com for online education on Step 2 and USMLEWorld.com for a good bunch of QBank. The best book to start with is First Aid for USMLE Step 2 CK. You can find it on Amazon.com.\nHope it helps\nBest of luck"

HCN or CO2 have a much lower probability. SiO2 is pretty abundant, but not as distinct molecules."

Besides being physically and emotionally relaxing, massage improves blood and lymph circulation, reduces nerve irritation and brings fresh oxygen and other nutrients to the affected tissues. Massage may also cause the body to produce fewer stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine (formerly adrenalin), and may also increase the body's production of pain-killing endorphins and the mood-altering hormone serotonin.\n\n  While seeing a professional massage therapist is relatively expensive, a friend or family member may be able to learn enough technique from a book or video to provide some relief for you."

I believe the original idea was to build a rocket base from which to explore the solar system. But somebody realised the same thing could be done from Earth via an orbiting space station for a fraction of the cost.\nThe only other reasons for going to the moon were - \n1. To stop the Russians setting up a military base there.\n2. To collect moon rocks.\nWhen the US realised that a Russian moon base wasn't practical, and they had souvenired as many moon rocks as they were ever likely to need, they never bothered to go back."

"2","how do beta blocking hypertension meds work and explain the meaning of beta in this situation.?","","There are at least 3 types of beta receptors in the body - beta 1, 2, and 3 - and they are sensitive to epinephrine and norepinephrine. beta 1 controls heart rate and force of contraction in the heart (an increase in these will increase blood pressure, thus blocking them will lower blood pressure). beta 2 controls smooth muscle many places in the body. beta 3 receptors have less well defined role in fat metabolism.\n\nThe late American scientist Raymond Ahlqvist suggested already in 1948 that opposite effects of catecholamines were mediated by different receptors in the target organs, which he called alpha- and beta-receptors. http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1988/press.html"

However, after the recent 'Weapons of Mass Destruction' propoganda and invasion on Iraq, it has lost its images in the eyes of the intenational community, making its economy facing serious challenges. This down-trowding started after 911 and seems to have continued after wards. \n\nAnother point is that if US economy gets disturbed, the global economy does recieve the after shocks soon. I hope the situation improves soon."
"7","what does fundamentalism mean?","","Oftentimes, we mean ""An organized, militant Evangelical movement originating in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century in opposition to Protestant Liberalism and secularism, insisting on the inerrancy of Scripture."" \n\nBut the concept of fundamentalism can be extended to any ideology or theology whose tenents include a strict adherance to a code, especially one which demands the observance by persons who do not subscribe to that code.\n\nNaturally, this makes for a source of conflict. And an understandable one at that. For example, say you believe some act is wrong. Furthermore, you believe you have a duty to prevent wrongdoing altogether. Consequently, you have a moral obligation to prevent any person from doing that act - including people who do not think that act is wrong.\n\nAny critical examination of a dogmatic theology or ideology will reveal how necessary this is, yet any objective look at disparate cultures will reveal how subjective - and frightening - this can be.\n\nThe hope of the future is that fundamentalist evangelism will be enacted by appeal to reason rather than dictates of law. Ideally, people would choose to perform 'right' acts for their own sake, rather than out of fear of punishment."
"6","Will the Texas Rangers ever entice good pitchers, given that their ballpark is hitter friendly?","","Since the move to the Ballpark at Arlington, the Rangers have had pitchers selected to attend the All-Star game, which suggests it's not a question of pitchers' willingness to play there, but greater concerns about contracts or the future of the franchise.  Kenny Rogers, Jeff Zimmerman, Aaron Sele, Roger Pavlik, and John Wetteland were all excellent All-Star selections in spite of the ""hitter friendly"" park.  It's more about the team and management that keeps pitchers away, and less about the stadium."
"7","Whats the difference between gas operated and blowback operated Guns??","","A gas-operated firearm operates on a similar principle of a car engine. When a round is fired, expanding gases propel the bullet out of the barrel, along with most of the gas. But a small portion of the gas is siphoned off into a seperate gas tube either above or below the barrel and forces a piston backwards, which in turn pushes back the bolt carrier, ejects the spent brass, and is pushed forward again by a recoil spring, stripping a fresh round out of the magazine and pushes it into the chamber to be fired. A blowback- operated firearm is comparatively simple. When a round is fired in a blowback-operated firearm, the bolt is forced back by the recoil energy of the spent brass itself, eliminating the need for a piston. The downiside to the simpler design is increased recoil, since not all of the expanding gases in a gas-operated firearm actually exit the barrel, there is less gas pushing the muzzle up and back. the blowback system is often found on smaller weapons, such as pistols and sub-machine guns, because it is simpler and requires fewer parts, which allows a weapon to be small and lightweight."

I have not attempted to execute the above script, it's just an example of what you could try, but you're going to have to do some research to make it compatible with multiple browsers, and have it automatically execute the script if the user resizes their window.\nAlternatively, put the whole site inside a table, and have an extra table row hold the image below the rest of the document."

"2","why do clouds turn dark when its about to rain?","","A cloud compsition is primarlly just billions of drops of water or ice.  When such a cloud formation has an influx of water/ice, ie it's mass increases to include more water/ice, light finds it hard to pass through the mass, thus making it darker for us to see.\n\nIn a normal cloud, light can pass through the water/ice within the cloud and we see it as a distorted white/bluish/greyish/greenish hue.  But when the cloud is too thick with water/ice, the light doesn't pass through so easily and we see a darker spectrum."
"3","Why old people always are complaining ?","Like my grandma for example: ""I dont like this ice cream is not tasty"" When the ice cream was really good.","Well, if you think about having illnesses and always being worried about health, older people might always want to pester people to let go of all the emotions bottled up inside of them. They have different points of views, like your example about the ice cream. So if you feel like you have a major problem with them, then try to put yourself in their shoes."
"4","what is inferred reality and class inclusion?","","Inferred reality is defined as the meaning of stimuli in the context of relevant information.\n\n""Inclusion"" is a term used by educators to describe a philosophical approach to the education of children with disabilities. This philosophical paradigm maintains that a child with disabilities -- even severe disabilities such as profound mental retardation -- should be placed in a regular classroom for most or all of the school day (Ayres & Meyer, 1992; Cloud, 1992; Conn, 1992; Shanker, 1993; Wolak, York, & Corbin, 1992). Drawing from the legacy of the Civil Rights movement, advocates of full inclusion for children with disabilities state that ""Inclusion is the ultimate goal for all children with disabilities regardless of their disabilities or current placement"" (New York State Education Department, cited in Shanker, 1993). This is not without controversy. Among the most vocal opponents are those in the deaf community, who feel that their culture and language are at stake (Cohen, 1994) and the Learning Disabilities Association of America, which believes that mandatory full inclusion policies violate federal law (""Full inclusion,"" undated)."

"1","I want to become christian?","I was raised with absolutely no religion, and have a hard time accepting christianity.  I want to beleive it.  What can I do?","Over the past couple of years, I made many friends from China - most of whom are raised with no religion. And they're all great and wonderful individuals who don't seem to lack anything. I have had at times to explain certain things about the Christian religion to them, which is the dominant religion in the western world, and its practice can raise questions to the uninitiated.\n\nIf you seek spirituality, you should not limit your self to exploring one religion. Why do you dismiss Buddhism, Taoism etc? You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\n\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. Learn, and let it be your choice. If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\n\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\n\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). You can learn more on different religions by following the links below.\n\nI know in China most Christians are unitarian, since in 1949 the Government forced denominations to form one single church or leave China.\n\nRemember learn before you act, and don't let anyone influence you. My opinion is that once you decide on something you should stick by it. Should you make the conscious choice to have Faith in a religion. So being absolutely certain is essential. Changing religions in the manner you'd change shirts is not ideal. Because then Faith - which is the most important element in every religion - never gets too strong to mean anything in your life.\n\nWhatever choice you make - good luck to you!"

"4","Is Yahoo or Google a better resource for research? What is another good resource for academic research?","Thanks.","My answer is google for the following reasons:\n\nPros of Google:\n\nAs a seach engine, google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me. Its the best in terms of researching information.\n\nFor makin money, a #1 on google is worth many times more than a #1 on yahoo. Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\n\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal. I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\n\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful. Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.\n\nGoogle has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.\n\nCons of Google:\n\nHowever, few problems with google, its web crawler dosen't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net, a feature which Yahoo provides.\n\nAlso, Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler, a feature which Altavista provided since 1999. The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\n\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs. Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush's name, the #1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.\n\nYahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies, for example Grokker.\nhttp://www.grokker.com/grokker.html?query=Anirudh%20Koul&Yahoo=true&Daypop=true&numResults=250"

"4","tell me more about hannuka?","","Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, is one of the most joyous times of the Jewish year. \n\nThe reason for the celebration is twofold (both dating back to c. 165 BCE): \n\nthe miraculous military victory of the small, ill-equipped Jewish army over the ruling Greek Syrians, who had banned the Jewish religion and desecrated the Temple; \n\nand the miracle of the small cruse of consecrated oil, which burned for eight days in the Temple's menorah instead of just one. \n\n\nHanukkah is celebrated by: \n\na. lighting a menorah for eight nights with olive oil or wax candles; one on the first night and an additional one each succeeding night \n\nb. eating food fried in oil, especially potato pancakes (latkes) and jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) \n\nc. playing with a dreidel, a four-sided top; the player wins or loses money depending on which side it lands on (each is marked with a different Hebrew letter)\n\nIn 1997, a 60-foot, 18-ton menorah was built in Latrun, Israel; a rabbi was lifted by crane each night to kindle the lights. The same year, a 12-foot pyramid of 2,400 jelly doughnuts was built near Afula, Israel; the pastries were later distributed to soldiers serving near the northern border. \n\nHanukkah began this year (2005) on the evening of December 25.\n\nSee poster:\nhttp://www.allposters.com/-sp/Menorah-w-toys-candy-and-gifts-in-background-Posters_i1459268_.htm"

"10","Can the electorial college override the majority of the vote? if so, why?","","Yes.  It is possible for the winner of an election to get as little as 39% of the vote, and carry the electoral college.  This happens when the winner wins by only a handful of votes in states he or she wins, and losing completely in all other states.\nThis is caused by the lack of proportional voting in states.  A states electoral votes, with exceptions of Maine and Nebraska, either go all to one candidate or the other.  If half the state votes one way, and half the other, the smaller half is effectively not counted.  With proportional voting, or district-level voting, this remains true, but it can only affect one vote per state, and is as likely to fall one way as the other.\nI hope this answered your question."

Make sure your SSID and WEP encryption key match your wireless router. If that still doesn't work, try connecting the wireless adapter to a laptop in the same location as your TiVo to make sure you actually have a signal.

"5","how is the RIAA catching individuals downloading pirated music?","How are they getting these people they are suing?  Are they tracking IPs, are they watching torrents, P2P, how are they doing it?","The short answer is, yes, of course they are tracking IPs.  The long answer to your other question follows.\n\nIt is a straight-forward, multistep process.\n\n1. Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\n2. Collect proof of misdeeds for each particular P2P service that is allowing illegal file copying.\n3. Sue the P2P service and demand they hand over IP addresses of offending users.\n4. Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\n\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\n\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\n\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\n\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\n\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\n\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\n\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school.  It makes them get a higher grade than they deserve and if the test is graded on a curve, your A- work can wind up being counted as a B+.  \n\nWell, songwriters composed that music and/or lyrics, musicians practiced and learned to play that song and paid to use a recording studio to perform it in.  When people don't pay to hear that play, the musicians still have their expenses to pay but no royalty check to pay for it. They lose money doing what they love.\n\nEven if someone cannot afford a whole album they can still afford to buy their favorite song for 99 cents."
"3","Does a root canal treatment pose a potential health threat?","I've heard conflicting opinions. What is your personal experience?","I had a root canal two years ago, and practically drove myself insane worrying about the potential health impact of it down the road.  Other than the first few days, I've never had any significant pain or discomfort.  I've come to the realization that since I'm only in my early 30's, I'd rather take the risk with a root canal and keep my tooth, rather than have it yanked and either be toothless or pay a lot of money for other options that would still involve putting foreign substances in my mouth.  So, I guess my recommendation regarding root canals would be that if you are a healthy person, with a good immune system, a root canal would probably be a good option, rather than losing your tooth.  But, I do believe they could impact your health, and the decision should be an informed one."

"4","who invented sudoku?","","The puzzle was designed by Howard Garns, a retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor, and first published in 1979. Most likely inspired by the Latin square invention of Leonhard Euler, Garns added a third dimension (the regional restriction) to the mathematical construct and (unlike Euler) presented the creation as a puzzle, providing a partially-completed grid and requiring the solver to fill in the rest. The puzzle was first published in New York by the specialist puzzle publisher Dell Magazines in its magazine Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games, under the title Number Place (which we can only assume Garns named it).\n\nIt was popularized by Nikoli in Japan, who gave it the current name of ""Sudoku."

"5","what good laptop can recommend a college student ?","i'm a freshman and i study business administration/Marketing","I would check with your school to see if they have a existing relationship with a PC manufacturer. Many times colleges get a killer deal when you consider they also include insurance and maintenance for the whole time you are in school. \n\nIf they have no deals or you don't like their deal, then I can recommend a ThinkPad. They are not the latest and greatest technology, but they are solid and easy to get serviced. We have had a few ThinkPads go down, but the local service companies handled the warranty repair without me having to ship the thing in, usually within a day or so. \n\nBut again, I know some Universities that handle repairs in house as well, even giving out loaners while the repair happens, so it's worth it to find out what your school offers."

"5","What is RSS?","","""RSS"" stands for Really Simple Syndication, Rich Site Summary, and/or Rockdale, Sandow, and Southern (Railroad) (if you trust the good folks at AcronymFinder.com). Really Simple Syndication is probably the most widely agreed-upon choice. As far as we are concerned, all three acronyms do an inadequate job of describing what RSS actually is: RSS is a standard for publishing regular updates to web-based content. Using this standard, Web publishers provide updates, such as the latest news headlines or weblog postings. Meanwhile, consumers use RSS reader applications (or one of a growing number of online services) to collect and monitor their favorite feeds in one place (RSS content from a publisher, viewed in one of these readers, is often called a ""feed"").\n\nIf you want to collect and browse feeds you have many choices, but there are two primary categories of feed reading applications: installable desktop programs and online services. There are many desktop applications for Windows and Mac OS system users, but two of our favorites are FeedDemon (Windows) and NetNewsWire (Mac OS X). Both require a small purchase price but are tops for ease of use and ship with dozens of feeds pre-loaded so you can explore the syndication ""universe"" right away. Free readers are available as well; a search for ""RSS Reader"" at popular search sites will yield many results.\n\nIf you would prefer to use an online service to track and manage your feeds, you have the advantage of being able to access your feed updates anywhere you use a web browser (and in some cases, on mobile devices). Also, any upgrades or new features are added automatically. The trade-off comes in different (some would say fewer) features and slightly slower performance versus desktop systems. NewsGator, Bloglines, and new RSS content capabilities in My Yahoo! are probably the three best-known examples of web-based feed reading services."

He gets cancer eruptions burnt off as they flair up but wants relief from continual ouchiness. He cant even wear his sun hat nor sun glasses anymore 'cause it hurts wherever they touch his skin. He tries to get his mind off of problems but he cant do anything without being irritated. (He already tried noxzema, uses zinc oxide, tries various skin products & soaps ...)  Any answers?? Thanks!","Please listen to me as I am only here to help. You have to do exactly as I say. Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive, but all your friends that may get cancer..."

"2","'Intelligent Design' should be better named 'Malevolent Design'. Do you agree ?","","Intelligent design embodies a theology that features a god who is malicious toward people.  \n\n1.  When you look below the surface, the world is filled with evidence that leads open minded people to conclude that evolution has occurred.  This evidence comes from the fields of paleontology, paleogeography, biogeography, molecular biology, genetics, embryology, and probably lots of others.  The god of intelligent design would have had to rig this evidence in favor of misleading us.\n\n2.  If the god of intelligent design violates the natural laws he created to create living organisms and to create false evidence, how often does he do this?  For example, maybe two seconds ago, he created the us and the entire universe, including this message up to this point, my memory of having written it, and your memory of having read it thus far.  If god violates natural law, anything is possible.\n\n3.  If the intelligent design god is going to create the world in any whimsical way, then he created all the suffering that we endure when he could have created a world without suffering.  Either he willfuly created our suffering, or he is an inept creator.\n\n4.  If the existence of complex organisms proves the existence of an intelligent designer, then the existence of the intelligent designer proves the existence of a more intelligent designer who created him.  ...and an even more intelligent designer who created the second one.   ...and an even more than more intelligent designer who created the thrid one.  ...and so on, ad infinitum.  Which one should be worshiped?  What will happen to our souls if we worship the wrong one?\n\n5.  I'm sure that people better versed in philosophy and theology could add many more reasons to believe that the god of intelligent design is malicious."

Weather patterns could be altered, bringing drought to areas that used to have lots of rain, and rain to areas that used to be arid.\n\nRead any of the sources below, and you'll find more information about the causes and potential effects.

I mean i've heard that joke about, ""use the best. apples for graphics, linux for servers and windows for solitaire"". I understand the joke but what is linux, who really uses it?","Linux Pronounced lee-nucks or lih-nucks. A freely-distributable open source operating system that runs on a number of hardware platforms. The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\n\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\n\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\n\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\n\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\n\n\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX"

"10","Were there any Marines that saw service in the European theater during WW II?","Were they exclusive to the Pacific and the war against Japan?","Shortly after the United States entered World War II, the Allies agreed that the European Theater would have priority in the war over the Pacific Theater. The Marine Corps' war was in the Pacific and all war plans regarding the employment of Marines reflected that. Nevertheless, because the Marine Corps was part of the naval establishment, it had responsibility also for furnishing men to parts of the Navy assigned to the European and Mediterranean theaters and to the operations conducted there.\n\nThese were not large Marine formations, but were, for the most part, individual Marines and small detachments assigned to guard duty at the barracks and naval operating bases established in the United Kingdom, or men assigned as ""sea-going"" Marines in the detachments of the large fighting ships. Another category was filled by those intrepid Marines who volunteered for duty with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), to undertake covert operations with the underground against the Nazis in the occupied countries of Europe and North Africa."
"8","why the movie brokeback mountain, hasn't been shown in all movie theaters?","","Cowboys have become an American icon, the very essence of manhood.  The idea that cowboys could be just normal everyday people with everyday problems is disturbing to a lot of the general public.  The thought that for example ""the Marlboro Man"", could be homosexual or bisexual ruins the mystique and romantic ideology of the whole post civil war era, Go West Young Man theme that our culture has come to take as the honest to God truth.  The fact that homosexuality has been around since before the Ancient Greco-Roman eras and was commonly accepted, even encouraged has been forgotten or buried under our more ""MORALISTIC"" current society.  The premise of this movie is totally realistic, and i look forward to seeing it, even though i am a happily married cowgirl to a most-definitely heterosexual equally happy cowboy.  Grow up people, accept and embrace the differences in our society or at the very least keep your fire and brimstone speeches and attitudes out of the theatres and in the church houses where they belong!"

"5","what is the pre-n router?","","Many organizations utilize wireless local area networks (WLAN) because of their convenience. The trade-off made is convenience for speed. Today’s most advanced wireless standard, IEEE 802.11g, operates at roughly half the speed of the most common 100 Mbit/s wired LAN. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to address this speed differential in the middle of 2003. Their vision was IEEE 802.11n, which would provide speeds equal to or greater than 100 Mbit/s LANs. Their work has yet to be completed. The lack of approval has led some to release so-called Pre-N equipment, which seeks to give the benefits of the 802.11n standard without an official standard. Because there is no official standard, implementing these products has future implications to customers.\n\n\nStandards\n\nStandards are made for very specific reasons. Foremost, they ensure that devices can operate with devices made by other manufacturers. Essentially, when a company releases a product before the ratification of the standard, they must infer what the IEEE is going to set. These inferences mean that the product may be incompatible with the final standard. If this does occur, an organization may be locked in to purchasing only identical hardware to that which they own. This would ensure compatibility.\n\n\nImplications\n\nAnother possibility if incompatibility exists is the release of an upgrade. The company would not be required to release updates, but if it did, there would be considerable work for the support groups. This may include individually upgrading each device, a very time consuming proposition. Despite the time commitment, an upgrade would be the most responsible course of action for the company because the customers would be able to choose any 802.11n solution for their purposes.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nIf an organization chooses to implement the Pre-N technology, the theory is the same as previous wireless network implementations. The setup would most likely begin with a router. This would be hard-wired to the Internet connection. There are also wired ports on the rear of the router. These allow any wired device to be included on the network. The router would then provide access to any device in its range with a compatible network interface card (NIC.) Currently, NICs exist for both desktop computers and notebook computers.\n\n\nAdvantages/Conclusions\n\nThe advantages to using this technology are clear. It will allow computers to connect easily to wireless networks, without sacrificing the speed possible with a wired connection. Another concern that comes up is that gigabit Ethernet is also available. If an organization were to implement this, 802.11n would again be just one-tenth of the speed. The implementation of any wireless network must be carefully considered. Regardless of which standard is followed, the security threats are common. Data is still being broadcast over radio frequencies. Before deciding whether to use Pre-N technology, one must first decide whether wireless is appropriate for their application. Only then should 802.11n be considered."

"2","Is DNA the real map from where we come from and where we go to????","","Interestingly phrased.\n\nYes, I would say that DNA is the map from where we are coming from. Researchers are using DNA and the relative similarities of certain sequences to deduce just how long ago we diverged from previous forms.\n\nWhat I mean by that: evolutionarily speaking, everything living on earth today can be traced back to a common ancestor (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor). The bigger the difference in the sequences of two species DNA, the longer ago we diverged from that common ancestor and the less related the two organims are to one another -- meaning there are more intermediate organisms between their current status and the ancient ancestor shard by the two.\n\nWe can use DNA not just to illucidate species broad histories, but individual histories too. We have a very unique piece of DNA in our cells. It is contained in our mitochandria. Mitochandria are little energy plants in our cells. The DNA in mitochandria, unlike the rest of our DNA, as we know it, is passed down only from our mothers. So, based on that, this DNA is less diverse. Any differences in this DNA has to come from mutations. Because the mutation rate is relatively slow, there are key ""markers"" that have appeared from time to time in specific subgroups of humans over time. So the markers you contain in your mitochandrial DNA are indicative of where which subgroup you are a decenent of. These subrgroups can be indicative of races, but as the more information we collect on the various markers from around the world, we'll be able to determine specific regions from which your ancestors lived and migrated to throughout history.\n\nAs far as a map to where we are going, I would say that DNA is that too, but that is less able to be predicted. Our DNA will definitely determine how our species continues to evolve. Let me give you an example. Let's say that this bird flu pandemic that the media has been stressing over the past 6 months actually does happen sometime in the future. An individuals ability to survive such a pandemic will be directly linked to their specific genetic sequence. Some will be innately immune to infection and thus will probably survive the pandemic. Others will not be so lucky. If the speculation is true and hundreds of millions of people do die, their genetic makeup will be eliminated -- thus those genes that make up those people will be removed from the general gene pool. The remainder of people will determine the fate of humankind. If another pandemic was to follow years down the road and the genes that were left over were succeptble to that infection, it could mean the end of the human race. More than likely though, there will always be some subset of the population whose genes allow for survival. From there, the future of humans depends on how overall fit those genes are."

So they deem the amount of sex or the intensity of the act as a means of actually being with someone. Rather than establishing the relationship first and allowing the loving to be the icing on the cake. It's kind of like when we were kids and played make believe. However,the difference would be that we adventually snapped back to reality.

His main occupations and services rendered were in Royal Prussia, as church canon, governor and administrator, economist, jurist, physician, astrologer and military leader (conducting defense against the Teutonic Order). Amid all his responsibilities, he treated astronomy as a hobby. His theory about the Sun as the center of the Universe, opposed to the traditional geocentric theory that placed Earth at the center, is considered one of the most important discoveries ever, and is the fundamental starting point of modern astronomy and modern science itself (it inaugurated a scientific revolution). His theory affected many aspects of human life, opening the door for young astronomers, scientists and scholars to take a skeptical attitude toward established dogma."""

"7","if my credit is bad how do i get a loan to get on the right track and pay all my debts?","","If you have past due accounts with collection agencies your best bet is to try and settle the debt with them for a portion of what you owe.  Your credit report will reflect the account as a paid settlement.  If you have medical bills you should make a payment to them every month, even if it is only ten dollars.  Most hospitals and doctors offices will not send your account to collections if you are still making small payments each month.  If you owe a credit card company they usually agree to drop interest charges or late payments in return for a lump sum payment to pay off your account.  If you still want a loan to pay your debts you should consider a secured loan from a bank or credit union.  They use your house or automobile as collateral until you pay off the loan.  Your other choice is to have a credit worthy friend or relative who has good credit co-sign the loan with you.  The only down side is that if you are late making loan payments or stop paying on it the co-signer gets his or her credit hurt as well as yours."

A bit back, I emailed a fellow who simply wished the question of motivation could be answered.\n\nI think the 2 most frequently asked questions that I address in my Beginners' Guide to Fitness and Bodybuilding are:\n\n1) How do I get motivated?\n2) How soon can I expect to see results?\n\nAfter doing some research today, I think the ultimate key to motivation is:\n\nPassion\n\nYes, p-a-s-s-i-o-n\n\nWithout that burning desire to succeed, most things will elude you. Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful. Without it, you'll only be partly committed and only partly successful.\n\nTake a look at any major sports star or entertainer, the passion they have for their sport is obvious. It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\n\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out. You can be very successful just doing 45 minutes a session, 3 times a week. You don't need to live in the gym or spend every second thinking about working out."
"1","Wasn't Jesus a Gnostic or an Essenes?","I am asking because I know he couldn't have been Christian; Christianity began after Christ.","Gnosticism was long thought to be a corruption of Christianity but more current thinking is that its roots are pre-Christian. It is highly unlikely, though not absolutely proveable that Jesus was not a Gnostic. The Essenes were a splinter Jewish sect so that was around during Jesus' life. There are some who believe that Jesus was an Essene. Others believe he spent some of his wilderness time with Essenes. Still others think that he never encountered yhe Essenes. Most who compare the recorded thoughts of Jesus with the recorded Essene tracts believe that they are incompatible. It is very unlikely, though not absolutely proveable, that Jesus was ever an Essene."
"2","Why is it so Foggy in the Central Valley of California?","","The fog that develops in the Central Valley is called Radiation Fog. The page listed 1st as a source states:\n\n""Climatologically important conditions for radiation-fog development in the Central Valley include cool 1600 LST surface temperatures, moisture availability as reflected by 1600 LST dewpoint temperatures, early evening surface cooling trends, the rapidity with which mean relative humidity reaches 90%, and the presence of cool, dry air aloft (700–500 hPa).""\n\nGo to this page:\nhttp://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2002/alm02sep.htm\nand find the header ""Radiaton Fog"" about 1/3 down the page to see a very nice explanation of how Radiation fog forms."

I would suggest conducting a search in your area for ""technical temp agencies"" or contacting a local employment recruiter to ask about technical temp agencies in your locale."

"7","Does cancelling store credit cards help or hurt your credit score?","","It may actually hurt you FICO score.\n\nOne part of the score is the amount of credit used versus the amount of credit available. So, let's take a look at an example:\n\n$200 total credit available\n$175 total credit used\n Ratio of 0.875 (high)\n\n$5000 total credit available\n$1000 total credit used\n Ration of 0.2 (relatively low)\n\nThe bottom ration of 0.2 is more ideal. Credit companies have found that the higher the ratio a person has (they get credit and max it out), the less likely they will pay it off.\n\nOf course some store credit cards do not report to the credit bureaua unless you go to collections. So it doesn’t matter what you do with them as long as you don’t stop paying them.\n\nIt’s best to just hold on to them. You might even consider having the credit limit taken up (but don’t max them out). It’s not how much of a limit you have that’s important to the credit companies, it how much of it you’re using.\n\nAlso you may want to consider the fact that although your credit score may not be affected very much if you cancel your card, if the store reports to the credit bureau, other companies will see that you canceled a card. To other companies, this means if they give you credit, you’re likely to just cancel it. Meaning you may be more of a hassle than you’re worth.\n\nHope this helps."
"2","How far did you go in Math? Algebra? Calulus 18? lol, Does it help you in life today? Or was it worthless?","","The farthest I went was Calculus II in college.  Do I use advanced calculus in my everyday life?  No.  \n\nHowever, it's not the idea of using it in everyday life, it's the problem solving skills you gain that make you smarter.  It helps to show you there are many ways to approach problems and helps you choose the best way to try solving them.  Don't give up on difficult subjects like these in school.  While you may not use the concepts day to day, you'll use problems solving skills every day for the rest of your life."

And a person can't be considered insane just for letting a ban on automatic weapons run could he? Or how about pulling out an international agreement to decrease emissions? That isn't insane either.\n\nHe isn't insane... just plain wrong."

"3","what kind of things did people do to get motivated to lose weight im having a hard time?","","Motivation is a hard thing. I've lost right at 150 lbs. & I'll try to explain the thought processes that led up to the weight loss, hoping to help you in the process :)\n\nFor me, part of it was a result of marrying my husband. He could care what I looked like but for some silly reason, I suddenly developed a sense of vanity...don't know why. Maybe because I am older than him, I don't know. Anyway, here's the real meat of it.\n\nTo tell the complete & honest truth, I was getting dressed one day & having one of those days where you don't feel comfortable in your own skin; nothing wanted to sit correctly on my body, I was in a bad mood to begin with &, well, I was just having a case of ""bad nasties"". I went through the entire day in this state & ended up walking by a store...Victoria's Secret, to be exact. My husband, the saint who managed to put up with me that day, commented on something in the window. He mentioned that he liked the item & wondered if he might find a place on the internet that made it in my size. It didn't make me feel bad, per se, because he accepts my size as a fact of life & has never been mean about it. But it just hit me oddly. I looked at the outfit &, though I knew that we could probably find it online somewhere, the idea of how I might look in it really bothered me.\n\nThat's what did it...that's what started the whole process. By the time we got home that night, my thoughts had worked around to the fact that I was tired of always being tired, tired of always feeling bad, tired of always not fitting into the clothes that I'd like to wear. I was tired of being fat, plain & simple. Even so, there was no easy way to take care of it &, having been overweight all my life, I knew that a simple diet wasn't going to cut it for me. So, here's how I handled it...\n\nWhen I eat, I eat ANYTHING I want...I'm not kidding. True, I try to keep mindful of what I'm eating but I also don't beat myself up about it. If I want a banana split, I darned well have a banana split. When I looked at what I ate, when & how I ate it, I realized that I ate in cycles during the month &, though I love sweets, my natural inclination was not to have them very often. The big problem for me was breads.\n\nAnyway, I just kept mindful of HOW MUCH I ate, not so much what I ate. I trained myself to realize when I was full & to make myself stop eating. As for this trick, you must always remember that it takes about twenty minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is full. So, I'd eat slowly, chew my food twice as long as I used to &, sure enough, I felt full rather quickly. Once I had that under control & truly listened to my body, I was constantly giving away nearly half of my food every meal.\n\nIt has taken me a number of years to lose the weight & the last 50 pounds has brought along a new re-evaluation of how small my stomach has gotten - we've wasted quite a bit of food over the past few months in that little quest - but I've gotten to the point now that I can go to Victoria's Secret & at least try on a few things :) I'm not into what I really want to wear but, hey, you take the successes where you can.\n\nAs I started to lose weight, the main thing that kept me going was how well I felt as well as clothes. I realized that, while I am not your regular clothes horse, I like the little game of moving from one size to another. I was in tears the first day & was able to purchase clothes off of the rack &, recently, when I was able to buy panties off of the racks instead of in the packages...OMG, I thought my husband was going to go insane. It took me over four hours to try on undergarments until I was satisfied with the look & fit! But you know what? I feel better about my body than I ever have & I thoroughly enjoy the look my husband gets on his face when he sees me! That's motivation, I can promise you...\n\nMy suggestion after all"

"4","Is Portuguese an easy language to lean?","Any resources for that. I bought a book ysday and I need to lean it as most in my family speak portuguese.","I wouldn't recommend that you do that.  A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about ""learning"" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think.  First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used.  Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language).  Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. Go for it!"
"9","My ex and I ""date"" but haven't been official in 9 years. How do I tell him that I still luv him and want more?","We've been knowing each other for 15 years, but throughout that duration were were together for 2 years. They were some of the best years of my life(well at least until the end). We're kind of like ""friends with benefits"", except we do other things as well. In between our dates we each from time to time go out on other dates, but it's not the same. I want him to know that I fell back in love with him and want more than what he is giving me. The only thing is that I'm afraid of rejection.I keep thinking that if he really wanted to be with me, then he would just tell me, because we are pretty close. But that's just it, he hasn't and that's why I am concerned about confronting him with my feelings.That's why I want the best possible way of going about this. All help would be greatly appreciated...","You are being used for booty and will never be anything more to him. I wish it didn't sound so harsh, but that's your truth. Either enjoy your ""benefits"" or move on. You may tell him you love him, but I bet your intuition has already told you the response to that and that is why you are scared. Actually I belive you should tell him, get it off your chest....and still move on."

""Hey, Susan, while I'm at work today, would you please vaccuum and water the plants?"" or (In a joking tone) ""Isn't it your turn to do the dishes?""  Open bills in front of them, and complain aloud about how high they've gotten.\nIf you want your house back, then be kind but blunt... Sit down with them and say ""I have loved having you here, but I'm afraid that I can't have you stay much longer...I have XXXXX happening in a couple of weeks and need to have some time to myself before that, but it's sure been fun!""\nOr lie and tell them your landlord has reminded you of the terms of your lease and your rent will be raised if they stay more than another week.\nGood luck!"

( I have bad knees sooo...)?","I have bad knees so whenever I do lunges knees crack suggestions?","unless the cracking is painful, it is not unusual or dangerous for your knees to ""crack"".\n\nLunges are excellent for strengthening the muscles around the knee joint. Make sure that you are not leaning over the knee, that the knee is right above the foot during the lunge and that you maintain a straight upright movement.\n\nDo not do hamstring excercises that will pull on the knee joint if you have problems with your knee. \n\nelipticals are good for running on with minimal knee and ankle stress. \n\nyou can also get large elastic bands...stand in them, and step out to the side pulling on the bands, then back in. Don't pull harder than is comfortable, this will help increase the stablization of the knee.\n\nLaying on your back you can pull your knee to your chest, and then extend it, locking your knee holding the leg just over the ground..repeating, this will also help strengthen the muscles around the knee with minimal weight on it.\n\nAlways is good to speak with a doctor or physical therapist if you have concerns."

They COULD be taking a spin off the more recent stuff where there were two Psylockes.

Psylocke with the same powers, etc., but with the old-school look she had waayyyy back in the older ish of Uncanny.  However, she had a mean streak in her... \n\nI think it's entirely possible (seeing as how true to the book the previous two movies were as far as the characters go) that Psylocke would start out bad, and yet come into Xavier's fold.  You know, kinda like how Nightcrawler was in the second one...?"

Since Jehovah's Witnesses understand that 'faithful slave' class to represent all anointed Christians on the earth as a group, Russell must have been anointed, and thus among the 144,000 resurrected to heaven."

"7","What is ottoman empire?","","Ottoman Empire also Turkish Empire\n\nA vast Turkish sultanate of southwest Asia, northeast Africa, and southeast Europe. It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after World War I. Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\n\n\nOttoman Empire (ŏt'əmən) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\nOrganization of the Empire\n\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\n\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\n\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\n\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\n\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. In Constantinople the Greeks and Armenians held a privileged status and were very influential in commerce and politics. The despotic system of government was mitigated only by the observance of Muslim law.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. The Ottomans, however, soon rallied.\n\nThe Period of Great Expansion\n\nThe empire, reunited by Muhammad I, expanded victoriously under Muhammad's successors Murad II and Muhammad II. The victory (1444) at Var"

They define the resistance to heat loss per unit time, temperature difference and area (i.e., higher is better).  These are English units, hour-degreeF-ft^2/BTU.  An R-value of 20 means that 100 sq. ft. of wall separating a 20 deg F temperature difference for 8 hours passes 800 BTU of heat.  Typical recommended R-values (ref. 1) for use in residences are 4 to 60, depending on climate and location in the house.  For walls the range is 11 to 28.  In the ref. 2 web site you can find R ratings for various insulation materials, in R-value per inch of insulation thickness, and thicknesses required for various recommended R-values."

Compare this situation with Ionic bond where electrns get completely transferred & the atoms get ionized (charged). So it concludes that atoms are neutral originally (Obviously).\nSo in a homolytic fission when electrons contributed by atoms are RETURNED back to them, why should they get charged ? They in a sense return to their original NEUTRAL atomic state i.e. a free & reactive radical .\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR !\n:-)"

"7","what does it mean when the american flag is lowered on the pole?","","Half-staff or half-mast describes the act of flying a flag approximately halfway up a flagpole (though anywhere from one-third to two-thirds of the way up the flagpole is acceptable). This is done in many countries as a symbol of respect, mourning, or distress.\n\nWhen hoisting a flag that is to be displayed at half-staff, it should be hoisted to full staff for an instant, then lowered to half-staff. Likewise when it is lowered at the end of the day, it is to be hoisted to full staff for an instant, and then lowered.\n\nThe original flag 'etiquette' was to fly the flag at one flag's depth from the top of the hoist. With the larger flags on shorter hoists on public buildings the practice of 'half-mast' has now commonly become to fly the flag at true 'half-mast' regardless of the size of the flag or hoist."

"7","are masons satanic?","","This is a true question of semantics and religion.  Some would say that first of all, freemasonry has no connection to religion, so there is no way to say that masons are satanic.  Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice.  Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called ""faith"" and the controlling of culture through that so-called ""faith""...thereby falling into suspicion of ""satanic"" influences.  It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\n\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.  Furthermore, any member of a masonic society will claim no knowledge of satanic connections to their brotherhood.  The secrets of these societies are replete with whispers of foul play and undertones of godless or godlike actions and/or beliefs.  \n\nYour answer lies in your question.  What is that you believe is satanic, what is your understanding of the subject your curiosity stems from, and whether or not you are willing to see what is beneath the surface....this is what will lead you to a more accurate answer to this question.  \n\nI hope this helped.

"5","How much does MoviTV cost for Cingular wireless customers?","","For $10 a month plus the cost of downloading, customers can access 22 channels directly on their handsets; shows including ABC News, CNN, and NBC Mobile, FOX Sports, Discovery, TLC, C-SPAN, and more. \n\n-->The Good \n-The price of MobiTV is only $9.99 a month. \n\n-->The Bad \n-Users that didnt get the Unlimited Internet package for $19.99 will be charged lots for using MobiTV. \n-Not having the package could mean for every 5 minutes you watch it, it would equal 1 MB using up 1 of your 3 MBs, So watching 15 minutes of it would use Cingulars current $19.99 plan for 3 MB of internet. Unless you were lucky and bought it when it was unlimited for $19.99."

"10","Why do inmates of state correctional systems have more rights than citizens of the free world?","","While they don't have more rights.  I talked to a former KKK grand dragon who had people that would actually commit crimes just before winter so they would have a warm place to stay.  Honestly, prison should be like the jail down in Arizona where they live in tents eat rotten meat and have to work on chain gangs.  They should not have a right to an education, they should not have a right to cable tv, should not have a right to weight lifting equipment.\n\nPrisons are refered to as thug university for a reason."

"5","what is the difference between DVD+R and DVD-R ?","","DVD-R (pronounced ""DVD dash R"") and DVD+R (pronounced ""DVD plus R"") are nearly identical formats. The discs look the same and are both supported by most DVD-ROM drives and DVD burners. The only difference between the formats is the way they determine the location of the laser beam on the disc. DVD-R discs use tiny marks along the grooves in the discs, called land prepits, to determine the laser position. DVD+R discs do not have land prepits, but instead measure the ""wobble frequency"" as the laser moves toward the outside of the disc.\n\nThe DVD-R format was developed by Pioneer and was released in the second half of 1997. DVD+R was developed by Sony and Philips and was introduced in 2002. Companies that support DVD-R include Pioneer, Toshiba, Hitachi, and Panasonic, while companies that support DVD+R include Sony, Philips, Hewlett-Packard, Ricoh, and Yamaha.\n\nHowever, most of these companies now develop hybrid DVD drives that support both DVD-R and DVD+R formats. They are known as DVD±R or DVD±RW drives. When looking for media for your DVD drive, make sure it ends in ""-R"" if you have a DVD-R drive or ""+R"" if you have a DVD+R drive. If you have a DVD±R drive, you can use either format. DVD-R is still more popular than DVD+R, but since they are both widely supported, it should not matter which format you choose."
"4","Is it worth doing Masters from University of Southern California?","I started off with my Masters program in Electrical Engineering in University of Arizona, Tucson where I did four graduate level courses. Later I shifted to California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) and did two graduate level courses in Electrical Engineering program. Now I received admission into Masters in Electrical Engineering in University of Southern California (USC) for Spring 2005. But I have found that USC would transfer only 4 units and that I would have to mostly do all the 27 units required for the Masters program in USC. That would cost me 27x1100 approx = 30,000 approx USD. Is it really worth graduating from University of Southern California spending that much money? Can I get the same job graduating from CSULA as I would get graduating from USC?","As someone in the technology field in the Los Angeles area, I would have to say that the USC degree is worth more than one from CSULA, because of the quality of the professors and program. USC's EE program is much higher rated that any CS school--in fact it's ranked among MIT, Stanford, Caltech, CMU, and others as one of the top schools in the nation according to the U.S. News and World Report. (That said, I got my own degree there...) The rankings were 1. MIT 2. Stanford 3. Berkeley 4. Georgia Tech / U of Illinois Urbana 6. Univ. of Michigan 7. USC Viterbi School 8. Caltech 9.

"7","should I buy or rent in California?","","Both buying and renting in California can be expensive, depending on the area you're looking to live in.  My husband and I were paying $900 a month in 2001 for a two bedroom, two bath apartment (900 sq ft) in Anaheim, CA.\n\nWhen we purchased our home in 2002, we were paying $1700 a month in mortgage payments for a 3 bedroom 2 1/2 bath home that is 1700 sq ft.  \n\nOur mortgage payment has since dropped, since we refinanced and got a lower interest rate.  I'm certain the rent price would've only increased year after year, as it had been.\n\nIf you can afford to purchase a house in California, I would consider doing so.

"3","Can I die from anxiety problems?  What can I do to take all the anxiety problems out of my body forever?","","A direct result from anxiety disorder isn't usually death, but it can certainly feel like you could die at times. If left untreated it could snowball into other problems, I suppose. For instance, if your anxiety is preventing you from leaving the house, you could be missing out on excersize. Just a small example.\n\nThe best thing to do is seek therapy and find out what it is that is the trigger for you. It can be crippling, and nobody should have to live like that. \n\nFor a quick fix, Xanax or a Benzo drug is effective, but not good for long term use. Zoloft is excellent, and non-addictive. The drugs are pointless without counseling though as you need to address the cause so it doesn't return after you stop your medication. It will help you to talk to someone. \nIf you don't wish to use medication, this is an excellent book that can help you better understand what you are going through. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572244135/qid=1135212967/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-5484893-1187962?s=books&v=glance&n=283155\nAnother helpful link: http://www.npadnews.com/faqs.asp#4\n\nGood luck!"

We put the soil in water to extract the contents and used the water to water some wheatgrass seeds.  The grass watered with the extract of the drainage soil was different in color, shorter, and had fewer root hairs, as I recall.  In other words, it was less healthy.  In our experiment, then, the type of water definitely had an effect on the growth of the grass."

I know that in time, feelings will only get stronger and then what?  I dont want to date anyone else...Should I just be patient??","Let him go.  If it's meant to be, he'll realize what an idiot he is and come back.  In the meantime, why should you sacrifice what you really want (a relationship) for someone else?

"2","what is a quantum leap?","","a quantum leap is when an electron gets excited, moving it to the next energy level, and then falls back down.  This falling back down produces energy in the form of light. (this is the reason neon lights and similar lights light up, the electrons get excited by the electricity, and the process of them falling down produces energy in the form of light. The color is determined by which energy level it is falling from and into, and usually remains consistent for each element.) Well anyway, the electron jumping from one energy level to the next is called a 'quantum leap'"

"10","Is it really all that difficult for a female to be elected US president?","With Geena Davis acting recently in Commander-in-Chief and almost no fiction (excepting maybe When Spirits Beckon at Amazon.com), it's surprising that there's very little discussion on the prospects of either Condi Rice or Hillary Clinton becoming the 1st female president.","Even if the right supports Condi in the Presidential Cabinet, I really doubt their support would run all of the way to the Presidency. There are far to many in the ""religion right"" that would have a ideological problem with a woman being President. \n\nAs for Hillary, I think she could get a lot of support from the more liberal left, but still not enough to be elected. Not to mention there is A LOT of dirt on her. The realities of who she is would turn away all but the most liberal minded. \n\nSo yes, I think it is difficult for a female to be elected. I wouldn't rule it out for the future, but for now I find it highly unlikely it could be accomplished."

"5","what is a transistor laser?","","A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a ""pure"" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned.  This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once.  Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.  That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells)."

Its like the old Polaroid camera - the camera was cheap, the film was expensive.\nI get my ink from ABC Ink.  For an older Epson printer, I pay $3.00 for black and about $4 to $5 for color.\nMy recommendation: before buying a printer, check the Internet for price of ink for that printer. Pick the printer that meets your needs that has the cheapest ink.\nAlso, there is now a business that will refill your empty ink cartridges for about 1/2 the price of a new one.  You can use Google to see if there is one near you.  But for my Epsons, the internet has the lowest prices."

"10","How is ""Brown & Root and Lyndon Johnson"" like ""Haliburton and Vice President Cheney""?","President Lyndon Johnson had the same type of cozy ""you bankroll me and I'll send a lot of government contracts your way"" relationship with Brown & Root as VP Cheney has with Haliburton today. Interestingly, Brown & Root bought Kellogg and became ""Kellogg, Brown & Root"", then ""KBR"", and then bought Haliburton with their massive Vietnam War profits. Haliburton IS Brown & Root, executing the same business plan that proved so successful in the 60's: put your guy into the White House (even if just as the de facto President), find a pretext for a war, have him find a way to get the US deep into the war, make MASSIVE PROFITS, PREFERABLY WITH NO-BID, COST-PLUS CONTRACTS, repeat.","Except your facts are all wrong. Halliburton acquired Brown & Root in 1962, well before major US involvement in Vietnam. KBR didn't become its own entity until 2002 after the asbestos lawsuits were going full steam ahead, threatening Halliburton assets. The company spilt off KBR and placed in under bankruptcy protection.\n\nSo what is your question anyway??? It appears to be a misguided attack on the right."

It tends toward longer, specialized trips by small groups within a wilderness or semi-wilderness setting mediated by minimal services; also called active, deep or eco-specialist ecotourism, this constitutes only a very small portion of the total ecotourism sector.\n\nSoft ecotourism is the most common form, where tourists hope to observe nature and culture closely, but casually. It is technically defined as ecotourism that tends toward shorter, multi-purpose trips within well-serviced areas frequented by large numbers of ecotourists; also called passive, shallow or popular or eco-generalist ecotourism, this accounts for most ecotourism activity."

If you ask a 15-year-old, in a simple answer he/she will say: “three”. Are there more dimensions beyond our understanding?","Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\n\nTime is often referred to as the ""fourth dimension"". It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\n\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size."

It might also help for you and your husband to talk about how you can enjoy each other and your relationship more privately so that your mom is not exposed to your husband's playfulness.\n\nYou might also just have to learn to live with it and not let it get to you.

To wit...\n- Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited, especially if it has an attachment.\n- Think twice before downloading that freeware.\n- Avoid Kazaa and the like.\n- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.\n- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides.  You should manually review your vendor at least weekly...even if you have an automatic update feature.\n\nA few minutes spent on satisfying yourself that you've done everything you can do will provide you with peace of mind."

Nor did you state who is handling your dispute (IRS Appeals, Collection Due Process, Tax Court). There's slightly different rules depending on what's going on.\n\nThe basic process for handling penalties and disputes is outlined on the IRS website.\n\nIn general, the IRS will investigate whether you are responsible for the penalty, and will send up a notice informing you that the penalty was waived or that you really do owe the penalty. Interest will accrue if you really do owe the penalty, but you haven't paid it yet.\n\nGenerally, I advise my clients to pay all penalties in full, and then dispute the penalties. This shows a good faith effort, and stops additional penalties and interest from being added to the account. If we lose the dispute, at least the client paid only the penalty and not additional interest. If we win, the client gets his money back.\n\nI hope this helps. Let us know how your dispute with the IRS turns out.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nWilliam"
"3","I'am doing a project and i would like to know if cystic fibrosis is a genetic diseases?","","Cystic fibrosis (CF), also called mucoviscidosis, is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease of the exocrine glands. It affects the lungs, sweat glands and the digestive system. It causes chronic respiratory and digestive problems.\n\nCystic fibrosis is exclusively heritable as both parents must carry the recessive genes for a child to acquire the disease. At the genetic level, cystic fibrosis is most often the result of an in-frame deletion of three base pairs in the DNA. Cystic fibrosis results from the production of an abnormal form of a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR functions in transporting chloride ions across epithelial cells found in the lung and intestinal tract. In CF patients, CFTR does not function properly, causing accumulation of ions inside epithelial cells. Since water follows ions by osmosis, this results in water depletion and viscous mucus on the surface of alveoli. The most common CFTR protein abnormality is a mutation termed ΔF508, which is characterized by the deletion of the DNA basepair sequence at chromosome location 7q31.1 that codes for a single amino acid, phenylalanine."

"5","what is Serialization in Java?Can anyone help me with an example?","","Hi,\nAs such I have never really been to Java. But the thing that you have asked is fairly technology independent. I will try to explain them in as much non-tech terms as possible.\n \nSerialization:\n Serialization is a process of saving state of an object in some format. State of an object means its current value which in turn comprises of the values of the members of the object. For example, if I have a class Student, having RollNo and Name as its members(properties), and an object of Student class 'Deobrat' is created with ROllNo=01 and Name=""Deobrat Singh"". Then serialization of the object Deobrat would mean, saving this object somewhere (either in memorystream or in a filestream or on a networkstream) in such a way that it can later be reconstructed to again form the same object.\nTo be a bit more elaborate, consider an example where I have to send an object across a network to some remote computer (something that we do in WebServices). Now, in this case, the object itself cannot be sent because the network doesn't recognise what an object is. It simply understands a stream of bytes and nothing else. Serialization allows us to convert this object into a stream of bytes which then could be sent across the network to the remote computer.\n \nDeserialization:\n Deserialization is exactly the reverse process of Serialization. It means, to convert the stream of bytes in order to reconstruct the original object (or object state to be more precise). In the Web Service example scenario taken above, the Service Request broker will simply extract the stream of bytes, Deserialize them to create the object and give it to the class that is supposed to process it.\n \nExternalization:\n Serialization is achieved in 2 ways.\nUsing the Serializable interface which tells the runtime(or JVM) that the class has only premitive types that are serializable by themselves so the runtime can go ahead and use it's own code to serialize any object of this class. \nOn the other hand, if you want to write a class that has complete control over the process of serialization & deserialization, you implement Externalizable interface. In this case, when an object of your class has to be serialized, the runtime will not do it by itself. Rather it will call a method writeExternal to serialize the object. You will have complete control over the stream and format of the data to serialize. While deserializing the object, again the runtime will call readExternal method on your class which is supposed to read the stream and reconstruct the object state.\nA word of caution:\n\n In most cases, it is sufficient to use the Serializable interface because you wont have to write code for the serialization process. But in certain cases where you have a very heavy class with a lot of properties which need not be sent to the other end, it is better to write your code using Externalizable interface, because, then you will have complete control over which properties need to be serialized and which need not be serialized. While deserializing, again, your class will know which are the properties that must have been serialized and accordingly, you can recreate the object state.\n\nIn general, if you want a custom (in most cases, partial) serialization/deserialization to happen, you use Externalization."

"7","what are the best ways to restore credit?","bad credit score","First: the ads that say ""we'll fix your credit!"" are LYING. You are the one who's going to have to do the job.\n\nFirst: get your credit report. Most states now have a law on the books that requires all of the credit reporting agencies to give you a credit report once a year. Check it over. Make sure that there are no *mistakes* on it - late payments that were not late, disputed accounts, etc. \n\nLate payments and charged-off accounts stay on for 7 years, bankruptcies for 10. Generally, lenders are looking for patterns of behavior rather than once-in-a-way problems. If you find something wrong (and it's likely, unfortunately), write a letter to the credit bureau, providing documentation that you're right. They have to respond in 30 days; if the creditor can't prove that the negative item is indeed true, it comes off your report.\n\nNow you're down to real debt. If you can't afford the payments, contact the lenders and negotiate reduced payments. They will prefer to be getting something rather than having to write off the debt. Once you can afford to pay everything, commit to paying off the worst (i.e., highest-interest) items first. They cost you the most money that isn't going toward paying off the debt. Once you've killed one, the money you were spending on that one can be applied to the next-worst debt, and so on. The amount you can pay any given creditor snowballs rapidly when you follow this pattern. You have to remember, though, that when the first one is paid off, you don't have ""more money"". You still need to be committing that to killing your debt.\n\nIf you're out of debt, but your credit is lousy, get a secured card, use it, and pay it off every month. This will do a lot for your credit rating. In addition, open a savings account, and make regular deposits. This shows you are saving money and have a resource to pay your bills."

"10","what are the pros and conts of the patriot act?","","Many aspects of the Patriot Act are uncontested; in fact, Nadine Strossen of the ACLU has stated that she agrees with over 90% of the provisions of the Patriot Act.  It's only a few provisions that are hotly contested\n\nIt largely tries to unify communication among several departments and provide easier access for law enforcement officers.  Online information was difficult to obtain before 9/11; access to judges was slower and required more paperwork; and more hoops were required before action could be taken.\n\nThe Patriot Act doesn't remove the safeguards, but streamlines and simplifies them.  For the most part, the same sorts of safeguards are in place, just with different requirements that are less burdensome on government.\n\nMany provisions are loudly decried in public, but few people ever discuss specific provisions of the Patriot Act they disapprove of.  Most of it seems to be mass hysteria without any specific citation of violations.  When the biggest complaint is that someone may look at your library record, it doesn't seem to be THAT violative of privacy.\n\nI've included links to the Department of Justice's defense of the Act, as well as the ACLU's criticism.  I hope that balances the views."

But the government had many statues of women with breasts exposed?  What is the big deal?","Your point is very logical. \n\nHowever, also keep in mind that television broadcast decency standards are fairly well-defined. \n\nEvery once in a while, the FCC decides it needs to enforce their powers by the means of a sanction or fines. Otherwise, if the FCC never enforced any rules, their granted powers would diminish over time until people believed the FCC lacked power. Since every government agency tries to keep as much power as possible there is probably political or institutional pressure for the FCC to enforce communications rules. This may not always result in equitable enforcement."

Its the best in terms of researching information.\n\nFor makin money, a #1 on google is worth many times more than a #1 on yahoo. Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\n\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal. I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\n\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful. Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.\n\nGoogle has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.\n\nCons of Google:\n\nHowever, few problems with google, its web crawler dosen't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net, a feature which Yahoo provides.\n\nAlso, Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler, a feature which Altavista provided since 1999. The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\n\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs. Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush's name, the #1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.\n\nYahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies, for example Grokker.\n\nhttp://www.grokker.com/grokker.html?query=Anirudh%20Koul&Yahoo=true&Daypop=true&numResults=250"

"2","How did the calendar start? Why 31, 30 and 28-29? Why 12 months?","","Man has been tracking time for tens of thousands of years.  Beyond the daily cycle of the sun, what is there to use to track time?  The moon and the stars.\n\nIt takes the moon about 29 1/2 days to go around the Earth, about a month.  The word ""month"" is derived from the same root as the word ""moon.""\n\nThe Earth revolves around the Sun over the course of a year, but if you don't know that, it appears that the entire universe of stars revolve around the Earth and Sun.  It takes about 365 1/4 days for the stars to go back to where they started, and that makes a year.\n\nSo the moon revolves around the Earth about 12 times a year, and thus we have 12 months.\n\nBut actually it takes fewer than 360 days for the moon to go around the Earth 12 times.  The months had to be lengthened so that 12 months match one year.  (Other societies used lunar calendars, which kept the month based on the moon's cycle.)  30 days per month would still make the year too short, and 31 days per month would make the year too long.  Thus we have some months 30 days and others 31 (and one other).\n\nEven still, the length of the year doesn't exactly match the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, so we make adjustments.  Every four years, we add a day to February.\n\nAnd still it's not perfect, so every 400 years, we don't add that day to February.\n\nAs for why February starts with only 28 days is not known for sure.  There have been different explanations, but it comes down to someone a long time ago making a pretty odd decision."

Giving them a gift card to a store that you know carries things that they like (i.e. best buy for electronics/media lovers, or Victoria's Secret or The Body Shop for the girly girl in your life) ensures (okay, maybe not ensures, but increases the chances at least) that this person that you care about is going to get a nice little splurge that they might not have given themselves just becase they had a few extra bucks in their wallet."

I had two different prescription medications as sleep aids that didn't work the way they should and gave me nightmares or left me foggy the next day, but the cheap old generic nightime cold/flu medicine similar to nyquil knocked me out like a light and didn't leave me feeling sleepy the next day.  If it's a chronic case of sleeplessness, perhaps you should make a visit to your doctor.  Don't use anything for extended periods of time to help you sleep, it can become a habit and those aids will eventually become less effective."

"2","What are some of the particles in the nucleus of an atom other than the proton and neutron?","","Protons and neutrons are the primary constituents of atomic nuclei, but these bits of matter can be further divided into quarks.  Quark come in six types, or ""flavors:"" up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom (or, if you prefer, truth and beauty.) Quarks are never observed by themselves, but are instead found in groups of two (mesons) or three (baryons). Nuclear particles are baryons -- neutrons are composed of two down quarks and an up quark (ddu), while protons are two up quarks and a down quark (uud).  The other four types of quarks are less stable, and tend to be observed only as components of high-energy, short-lived particles inside supercolliders, bubble chambers, and the like.\n\nProtons and neutrons are thus the only directly observable particles within the nucleus.  However, they are bound together by another type of particle, not directly detectable that appropriately enough is known as a gluon.  Gluons, like photons, are force-carrier particles, and they are the intermediary for the transmission of the weak nuclear force, which binds the positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons."

"1","Do I have to have a religion?","","If you don't believe you don't believe.  It is OK.  Why should you believe in somehting of which there is no proof?  \n\nIn my personal opinion, there are only three reasons people become religious:\n\n1)  They are fearful.  Fearful of death, fearful of not knowing the purpose of their existence, fearful of losing everything that they value in this life (which you will, gauranteed).  Fear is a powerful motivator and when someone offers you a way to manage that fear through a belief system it can be tempting to accept.  There is no need to resort to philosophy, science or psyhcology.  There is no need to accept that there are rational and scientific explanations that we as humans simply don't know yet.   Just believe that someone's making it all right in the end and you're all set.\n\n2) They are seeking a path to redemption for past sins.  They are having difficulty coping with the consequences of some bad action they have taken in thier life, and or are trying to control some compulsive behavior that has caused hardship in their life.  Either they were in prison, got caught with a prostitue, or drank themselves out of job and their family, or simply told a horrible lie that they feel guilty about.  Religion offers instant redemption and rituals to help you ease your mind through repentance.  \n\n3)  They have a strong natural desire for community and companionship.  Having someplace to go every Sunday with likeminded people or having rituals to follow when someone dies, or having a language or framework to use when communicating your values with others can be very comforting.  If your family already subscribes to these beliefs you even may feel pressure to accept things that your logical mind tells you are impossible and&#92;or unlikely.\n\nYou can deal with these three situations through patience, meditation, compassion, seeking help from others, and community activism, or you can choose to believe in supernatural beings and mythology.  My personal opinion is that there is no easy way out of any problem so that when a christian says I can instantly have my sins forgiven or a Scientologist tells me that body thetans are causing my suffering, or some guru tells me that my Shakras just need alignments, I usually take a pass."

"4","what is the concept of global warming?","","Global warming has two main applications. The first is that there are certain gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming planets. This is known to take place on Venus, Earth, and the gas giants. Earth is the hospitable place that it is because of global warming.\n\nThis takes place because of greenhouse gases, which allow radiation from the sun to pass through the atmosphere and warm the surface of the earth. The surface then re-radiates this energy back towards space in the infrared spectrum. This energy would escape and our planet would be as cold as the moon, were it not for the greenhouse gases (mainly CO2, ozone, methane, and water vapor). They absorb the infrared energy and radiate it back to earth, increasing the overall amount of radiation hitting the earth's surface, keeping it warm day and night.\n\nThat this takes place is clear and indisputable. There is simply too little energy coming from the sun to account for our planet's temperature. The controversial point is when global warming is applied to the current rise in average global temperature that has taken place over the past 50 so years. Most scientists believe that warming of the planet is due to increases in greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, mainly due to human activities on earth."

A total of about 50 million men have had a vasectomy--a number that corresponds to roughly 5 percent of all married couples of reproductive age. In comparison, about 15 percent of couples rely on female sterilization for birth control.\n\nApproximately half a million vasectomies are performed in the United States each year. About one out of six men over age 35 has been vasectomized. The prevalence of men undergoing the procedure increases with higher levels of education and income. Among married couples in the United States, only female sterilization and oral contraception are relied upon more often for family planning.\n\nHow is vasectomy done?\nIn the conventional approach, a physician makes one or two small incisions, or cuts, in the skin of the scrotum, which has been numbed with a local anesthetic. The vas is cut, and a small piece may be removed. Next, the doctor ties the cut ends and sews up the scrotal incision. The entire procedure is then repeated on the other side.\n\nRelated Links on MedicineNet.com \n\nPage 2 of this Article \nRelated Medical Procedures and Tests\nThe Doctor's Response\nInformation on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Vasectomy is a popular method of birth control: in 1983, figures showed that approximately 10 million men had been sterilized in the U.S. since 1969. Excision of the vas deferens is a minor surgical procedure that can be performed in a physician's office in less than half an hour. A small incision is made on one side of the scrotum (the external sac housing the testes) and the vas deferens is located, cut, and the ends tied off. The incision is closed and the procedure is repeated on the other side. After surgery, it is necessary to wait until a negative sperm count is obtained before discarding other means of contraception, because viable sperm cells are retained in the seminal vesicles (the pair of storage pouches where sperm is mixed with other components of semen) and along the various sperm ducts. In addition it is usually advised that the patient be reexamined after a year, because the severed ends of the vas deferens occasionally reknit. Sterility resulting from vasectomy is considered to be permanent, and attempts at surgically reversing vasectomy, called vasovasotomy, have had limited success. In India, where the government is trying to stem the tide of overpopulation, money is paid to men who submit to voluntary vasectomy. Efforts to overcome the irreversibility of vasectomy have also led to experimentation with the implantation of faucetlike devices that can be made to open or close the sperm duct in a simple operation. Such devices have functioned successfully in animals but are still considered experimental in humans because of their unproved reversibility, high cost, and the degree of surgical skill needed to implant them. Another option suggested to those undergoing vasectomy is to preserve their fertility by depositing semen in sperm banks. Such semen samples are frozen in liquid nitrogen below −300°F (−185°F) and are considered to be viable for an indefinite period. However, there is considerable debate over the scientif"

"1","What does satan do?","","Satan is known as the tempter.  it has been foretold that Christ Jesus will come back to Earth, and when that happens, he will throw Satan into the lake of fire where he will suffer for eternity.  Satan is called the temter, because he temts people to sin.  he does this becaus he does not want to suffer alone.  and God allows this, so that we may prove our faith.  but God also puts a collor on Satan, in that Satan is cannot tempt us more than we can bare (handle).  this also makes that whole statement ""the devil made me do it"" a complete and udder lie.  from now unto our death we will always have a choice: follow God or give into the temtations that Satan has placed before us and join him in eternal damnation."

"9","My girlfriend just told me that she was over everything, what am i to think of this?","I have been dating the same girl for about 4 years and she moved in about 9 months ago.  Before we moved in together we had only argued a couple of times.  Now we probably argue once a week.  For me I know it’s common to argue, but today I suppose was different.  I just had bought dinner for us and we came back home to a mess.  I began cleaning up the house and after 30 minutes I asker her to help.  A huge fight ensued because she was slamming things around and I had asked her to stop.  I told her that it is okay for her to be upset with me, but to please not take it out on the dishes.  She got angry and said that she can’t stand these arguments and that she was just over everything.  She then stormed off to her bedroom and that’s that.  Is my relationship coming to and end?","Something seems to be missing in your story--or your girlfriend is schizoid.  But seriously, it isn't really normal to fight every week, so possibly she is still angry about whatever it is you guys have been fighting about.  I would think about the tone you may have had when you asked her to clean, I imagine you were upset because she wasn't helping, and that may have set her off.  If you want to save your relationship talk to her like an adult to an adult and try to figure out how to resolve your problems in a positive way.  Try to avoid accusatory and patronizing statements.  You two are probably just having trouble adjusting to living together.  Good Luck"

Sometime between Jesus being born and today, people began to assume that there were 3 wise men merely because they brought three gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. In reality, there were most likely more than 3, but there's no way to prove how many there actually were."

That's the problem while you CAN get in legal trouble by downloading stuff this way, chances are the person sharing the files is going to get in trouble, if they are ever caught.\n\nIf you want to stay safe, you can download files relatively safely without getting caught, it's the sharing that gets you in the most trouble.\n\nI would say it lies in a grey area and there is no definitive answer.  If you want my opinion, no it is not really legal but there is nothing in place to really stop it."

"2","What is 'Divine Proportion'?","","The divine proportion is also called the golden mean or abbreviated by the greek letter phi. The actual value is (1 + root(5))/2 or about 1.618 (the number actually never ends and is irrational, because root(5) is irrational).\n\nAs an application, say we have a line of length 1. If you had another line of length 1.618, the ratio between the two would essentially be the golden mean.\n\nThis ratio occurs almost everywhere in nature. Shells form golden spirals, the ratio from tail to dorsal fin and dorsal fin to head on a dolphin is about the golden mean, same for foot to waist and waist to head in humans. So on and so on. It also has been a dominant design principle for much of civilization. The parthenon, for instance is composed of many golden rectangles and books are often designed so that the box of text forms a golden rectangle. There is something about it that is inherently pleasing to the eye."
"6","If a woodchuck were to actually chuck wood, what is the quantity of the wood that would be chucked?","","I despise those who don't take your question seriously. I bit my thumb at them. Fie.\n\nThe answer depends on what you mean the woodchuck, a common name for groundhogs and woodpeckers. If you mean groundhogs, then the answer is unfortunately quite a small amount of wood. My guess is probably two logs an hour. Small logs.\n\nAccording to the prominent wikipedia.org: ""The name woodchuck has nothing etymologically to do with wood. It stems from an Algonquian name for the animal (possibly Narraganset), wuchak. This confusion led to the common tongue twister, 'How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? — A woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.'"""
"2","Could planets exist in stable orbits around binary stars?","Could planets exist in stable orbits around binary stars?","That might depend on wether the binary stars are very close (and spinning about each other) such that they ""look"" almost like a simple center of gravity relative to a planet far enough away to not be affected by lets say bumps in the gravity field.  Einstein told us that gravity distorts space and planets therefore merely follow the curved space layed out for them.  The earth senses the gravitational pull of both the sun  and say Jupiter but only the sun has a major affect because of proximity and mass.  The short answer to your question is that planets can exist in stable (though irregular) orbits around binary stars depending on the curvature of space in its orbit.  Hope that helps a little."

"7","What is the best money making products to sell on ebay?","","The product is only a portion of the battle.  You still have to to think about your ability to sell.  Then what price it will cost to obtain a certain product.  Its alot of pulling and tugging to make a profit on Ebay.  But, products come and go all the time.  When fads hit, it also hits Ebay.  When the fads are gone, those numbers also dwindle on Ebay.  The other half is your ability to sell the product.  I have seen so many people sell the product the wrong way, that even if it was priced low enough, nobody would bid.  So, you have to figure out what drives customers to bid, regardless of the product.  Your best bet is creating a product and selling it on Ebay.  I have heard people selling things on Ebay that they made.  I heard someone making 200 a day selling hand made cloaks.  But, thats them, you have to find your own market.  Um, last part about ebay is reselling a product.  If you see something cheap enough to make a profit off of, then by all means buy it.  See, if you buy something for $100 and sell it for $105, you only made $5 buxx.  And after Ebay fees, you make ""jack.""  But, if you can find a product for $12 dollars and sell it for $25, then you make a better profit.  Now its all up to you to sell as much as you can.  See?  So, small stuff can be worthwhile some times.  I used to do okay selling 99 cent coins.  Not bad for free stuff.  I would sell about 100 of them a week.  Thats not bad for 3 hours worth of work.  But, its not enough to live off of, so I sell other things as well.  So, to recap, its the product (try to create one yourself if you have to), the price you can get it for (so you dont sell the same product for more then everybody else), and your ability to sell.  Those three factors, fine tuned will help you get started."

Namely Official languages (Central administrative)& Scheduled list of languages for official use.\n\nOfficial languages are Hindi and English\n\nAnother 22 regional languages for official use.\n\nOnly around 40% of Indians speak Hindi as mother tounge but nearly 70% can understand Hindi.

"1","What percentage of the U.S. male population is gay?","","Main problem in gathering statistics on gays is that many people who are homosexual do not want to admit, even to an anonymous interviewer.  This is particularly true of people in heterosexual marriages.  Probably Kinsey's 10% figure was skewed higher by some sampling problems.  The low-end figures are likely wrong due to people not being honest when surveyed.  An article in the gay press today said the British government estimated about 6% of its population was gay."
"7","Are you planning on making a New Years resolution?  If so, what is it?  Did you make one for this past year?","New Years resolutions for me don't work.

Its a young team too."
"2","how season ocurr?/what factors affecting them?","","The above is an incorrect answer. Seasons do not occur because of the distance of the earth to the sun. In fact, during winter, the earth is physically closer to the sun and during the summer, it is furthest.\n\nTilt is key. Its important that not only is there a tilt on the earth, but the direction of that tilt is not altered during the rotation of the earth around the sun.\n\nThe Northern hemisphere is always tilting away during the winter, and towards the sun during the summer. The tilt of the earth is 23 degrees. So lets say you're at 45 degrees lattitude. During the summer, the sun will rise to 45+23 (68) degrees because the tilt is towards it, and in winter, the sun only goes to 45-23 (22) degrees. There is a big difference between the sun going up 22 degrees and the sun going to 68 degrees.\n\nWhen the sun goes to 68 degrees, it is more overhead, and the earth therefore receives more of its rays. During winter, light rays are striking obliquely, and hence do not warm the earth as much.\n\nThis is why there are less variations of seasons around the equator, where the sun is almost always directly overhead all the time.\n\nAnd this is why seasons are reversed on the southern hemisphere. When the northern hemisphere tilts towards the sun, the south is tilting away."

"5","Can the cd-rw drive in my laptop play dvd's?","Do I have to buy new hardware, or is there a software fix?","DVD is a different format with respect to CD RW. If your hardware supports only CDs for reading and burning, then there's no possibility of it reading the DVD. As you mentioned that you have a laptop, I guess it should be a DVD combo, i.e. DVD read only and CD Read/Write support, because that is the standard in laptops. I rarely have known a laptop model which has a CDRW drive, excepting if it is older than 2 years. You can check the DVD logo on the side of your drive. \n\nIn case it is a cdrw and you need to play a dvd, you need a computer with dvd drive on your network neibourhood. Just share the DVD drive on that computer, and you can access the DVD drive as your own drive. Best of luck on the experiment."

"1","Why is snow depicted in a crib, when there is no sow fall in bethlehem?","","Because Christ was not born on ""Christmas"" December 25. You are correct in the statement about snowfall in Bethleham. Winter in Bethlehem is a cold and rainy season, and a time when shepherds would not spend the nights outside with their flock. (Sheep have wool to keep them warm) Christ was likely born closer to springtime, as the shepherds WERE out with their flock overnight. The date for Christmas was actually stolen from Pagan Sun-worshipers and instituted as the birth of Jesus by emperor Constatine to try to unite his kingdom. Research it a little and you will find that even some of the clergy acknowledge this fact. Yet they still perpetuate the lie. \n\nSanta? Stolen from festivals in Holland.\nBesides Jesus never told his deciples to celebrate his birth. Aren't Christians supposed to be Christlike? In the Bible, the only meention of a birthday celebration during Jesus' life was of a Roman ruler that ended with John the Baptizer having his head cut off and served on a platter. You think Jesus likes Birthdays?"

If she pokes at you and causes problems, tell someone, don't do it back, and go back to ignoring her and going on with life.

"2","uses of pythagoras in daily life?","","Typically the 3-4-5 triangle method is used during contruction of some sort where you need to ensure a right angle.  You often know the length of one side of something and want to know where to place the other side so that it is at right angles.  I used this to frame our basement walls so they would be ""square"" for drywalling and laying the floor."
"2","what are the two moons of mars called?","","Mars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. Phobos (fear) and Deimos (panic) were named after the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek war god Ares, the counterpart to the Roman war god Mars. Both Phobos and Deimos were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. The moons appear to have surface materials similar to many asteroids in the outer asteroid belt, which leads most scientists to believe that Phobos and Deimos are captured asteroids.\n\nRefer to the source site for more info"

"2","Could inteligent life have evolved from a different animal group, such as reptiles, birds or even insects?","Does higher intelligence (such as humans have) require some quality that only mammals have?","The fact that female mammals produce milk for their young means that at birth a mammal can have a relatively large brain, although they are relatively helpless.  Other animals have to be able to at least get around.\n\nBrains don't grow as much as other parts of the body, which is why babies seem to have large heads.\n\nThe obvious counter-example is birds, where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food.  However, flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be, and so how heavy its brain can be.  But flightless birds are a possible candidate.\n\nAmphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded, which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence.  On the other hand, perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep.  Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg (and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well)."

"7","What's the basis for Daylight Savings Time?","","Benjamin Franklin  was among the first Americans to discuss the idea of Daylight Saving Time. In fact, he proposed the idea while serving as U.S. minister to France as a way of conserving the cost of lighting for shops. The purpose has been to essentially utilize more of the daylight hours in spring and summer for daytime activities. Simply put, the Sun is up longer in the sky (rises earlier and sets later) in summer. Clocks and common mechanical timepieces keep what's called civil time, which roughly corresponds to the passage of a fictitious ""average"" Sun through our sky. This is necessary since the Sun does not rise and set on a regular basis, but changes by as much as 15 minutes throughout the course of the year.\n\nDaylight Saving Time was generally adopted by countries around World War I, but President Wilson repealed the United States' mandatory daylight savings law on March 31, 1918. During World War II, Daylight Savings Time was reestablished by law on a year-round basis, and later seen as a fuel saving measure during the Arab Oil Embargo crisis of 1973-74. In late 1974, standard time was brought back. During World War II, the U.S. and some other countries implemented ""double"" daylight savings time consisting of a two hour shift."
"3","How to improve on premature ejaculation?","","A technique known as the ""PC Squeeze"" can help control premature ejaculation. This involves flexing the PC muscle repeatedly. You can find your PC muscle by stopping the flow of urine. The muscle that is used to stop the flow of urine (located between the scrotum and butthole) is also the muscle that controls ejaculation. Doing a PC workout each day can help strengthen the muscle. It recommended that you start easy: 3 sets of 15 squeezes followed by one long squeeze a the end. After a few weeks of this, the sets and reps can be increased to the point of fatigue."

"6","why did they ban baseball from olympicss?","why did they ban baseball from olympicss","Because the MLB didn't want to suspend its season to let the professional players go to the olympics, in a manner similar to what the NHL does for the winter olympics.\n\nThis plus other problems like a poorly designed qualifying scheme meant that piss-poor teams from Europe and Africa went to Athens, but several very good teams from N & S America were left out led to almost no ticket sales.

"1","What is the difference between the fancy forks?","","As far as ""fine dining"" goes, there are multiple ways of setting a table, thus there are many different sets of sivlerware.  The American Standard at a nice restaurant/banquet is to have two forks on the left (One slightly smaller than the other) and the two spoons and the knife on the right of the plate. The smaller of the two forks is used for the salad, and is always the fork on the farthest side (using the american standard.)\n\nYes, the forks differ other than size. One of the prongs on the salad fork usually resembles a tooth pick so you can grab the food that always slips away... like tomatoes."

""Killer Queen"" I believe its called.\n\nLooking forward to his next album!"

"6","how are the mets gonna do in 2006?","","although it's no guarantee, it looks like the mets have a great shot at winning the nl east in 2006.\n\nthe 2005 standings:\n\natlanta: 90-72\nphilly: 88-74\nmets: 83-79\nflorida: 83-79\nwash: 81-81\n\nnow, washington performed well above what was expected of them, as they gave up 30 more runs than they scored. florida has traded all of their talent for prospects. therefore, those 2 teams are likely not going to win the division.\n\natlanta lost their leadoff batter and sparkplug rafael furcal and replaced him with edgar renteria, who was great two years ago but does not provide the same offensive or defensive weapons that furcal does. atlanta also got a monster year out of andruw jones, who likely will not repeat that performance. also, the braves lost their closer, kyle farnsworth, to the yankees and will likely go with chris reitsma, who was good but not great last year in limited duty. however, the young players on the braves roster such as jeff francoeur, adam laroche, and ryan langerhans should develop further. also, a full season of former mvp chipper jones would be helpful. that leaves the braves with a good chance to win 90 games again. \n\nthe phillies traded jim thome to the white sox for aaron rowand, which improves their team even though i feel they should have gotten more for thome. with a shot at first base for a full season, ryan howard should put up some incredible numbers. chase utley, their 2nd baseman, should also leap to stardom this year. however, the phillies other big star, bobby abreu, wants to be traded, and that most likely means that the phils will not get full value for him. lastly, they lost their elite closer, billy wagner, to the mets. tom gordon, though he's old, should be a serviceable replacement, but will not be as lights-out as wagner. unless brett myers becomes consistent and shows he can be an ace, the phillies pitching staff is comprised basically of a #2 starter, 3 #3 starters and a #4. many teams would be happy with that pitching staff, but it doesn't win the division for you.\n\nthat leaves the mets. the mets record last year was worse than it should have been, as they scored many more runs than they gave up. trading for carlos delgado to replace the worst 1b positional output in the majors will be a big boost. signing wagner to close instead of the shaky braden looper will help a lot as well, as looper blew 8 of 36 save chances. add in the continued development of david wright, who exploded at the end of last season, and jose reyes, as well as a bounceback year for center fielder carlos beltran, and the mets look very good up and down. paul lo duca should provide similar numbers to last year's fading mike piazza, but should also stay healthy, as the mets backup, ramon castro, is solid and should play every fourth game or so. the mike cameron-xavier nady trade made a lot of people say ""huh?"", but it's actually good for the mets, as victor diaz has proven himself worthy of a shot to play in right field every day. if jae seo gets a chance to start for the full season and performs like he did at the end of last season, he will be a solid #2 pitcher. problems could include the aging of tom glavine and steve trachsel, the inconsistency of kris benson, and the lack of bullpen depth. i'm not convinced that uber-GM omar minaya won't get his team more help in the bullpen, with rumors abound that the mets wish to sign danys baez, the devil rays all-star closer, to set up for wagner.\n\nall in all, this mets team could win 100 games and take the nl east easily."

All of these N containing intermediates converge into the TCA cycle from where they become amino acids through enzymes known as deaminases or transminases. These amino acids converge to a common amino acid (alanine in humans, if i recollect well) which then travels to Kidney and initiates the UREA cycle to finally result in the production of Ammonia"

Even the 9th Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, proven to be the most liberal, anti-death-penalty court in the nation, could not find sufficient cause to nullify the verdict.  He received his fair trial, his fair appeals process.  He continuously professed his innocence to delay (for nearly 30 years) his sentence, nothing more.  He capitalized on the fact that American society, with it's EXTREMELY short attention span, would forget the horrific crimes he committed.  He gambled on the possibility that we would forget what he did, become desensitized to it, and dismiss the jury's decision overly harsh.  Some arguing in his defense tried to portray the jury as a bunch of racist white rich folks intent on ""murdering another innocent black man"" (it wasn't all-white, check the record).  Fortunately, all of the right people saw through his charade, and ended his shennanigans, permanently."

"10","Which should i join, the Navy or the Air Force?","Please give specific details and reasons why i should join either of them.  Thanks.","Being a Navy wife for 30 years, I would say the Air Force. The brances go by reading levels. Air Force, Navy, Marine, Army are the levels. Then you want the pay. Same levels. Education, Medical, Dental is offered by all branches no difference. You want to get a job that pays good and one that advancement is in. It is all about time in and money. When the recuritor tells you you will be getting your Medical ""Free"" that used to make me laugh, because it comes out of your taxes you are paying for it. Not the president. No there is no money transpired, but you are still paying for it. If you want to go into the service, go to college first, go in as an officer not a civilian. Money money money.  That is what you want to get. Your rate and rank has to go up.You will always be tested to achive a better rate. Now, it is a big commetment.  You are going to get married to the service.  There is no way out until your tour is up and then they ask you if you want to stay in.  Will you be educated enough from the military to go out into the world and get a good paying job?  Suppose you fall in love and get married, you cannot live on base unless you are a certain rate. Base living is very nice, but you are not making a lot of money. So now you have to live off base.  Rent is high. So no marriage until your first tour is up get your education and your money.  Better still, go to college before you go into any branch of the service. \nPlease go to college first."

It's an interpretive language, and so often when you install other software, Python is installed with it.\n\nPerhaps some program that you installed also installed Python.  Several BitTorrent programs were written in Python.  It's an open source language, so consider what programs you have installed recently.  \n\nCan you delete it?  Most likely.  But there's a good chance that something won't run - probably just a software package that you picked up along the way.  But if something stops running, you can always re-install Python.\n\nSee http://www.python.org"
"9","What are good sound reasons for getting a divorce?","My father told me to set what would make me divorce my husband and just deal with whatever did not fall in those reasons.","Watch for the red flags prior to marriage.  But when in love, we often miss the red flags, so if that happens, here are what I consider serious and justifiable grounds:\n\nAdultery -- many people can't move past this.  It's a physical betrayal, but also tears at you emotionally.  I personally think it's one of the most difficult ones to resolve.\n\nAbuse -- physical or verbal.  Verbal often gets overlooked, but it's namecalling, screaming at you rather than holding a normal conversation, talked down to, and did I mention yelling and screaming?  If you ask the person a normal question, like ""do you have any change for the toll?"" and they start screaming that ""all you do is harp about money,"" you've got a problem.  Physical is obvious, but don't overlook punching walls, breaking dishes, etc.  Watch out for signs of roughness or  meanness to your children and pets too.\n\nControl Freaks:  This is also a form of abuse, but these men want to know your every move, monitor your phone calls, read your email and voice mails, won't let you go to the mall alone, etc.  Insist that if you get a new hairdo or buy a new dress, it must be because you're cheating with someone.  This is usually disguised as jealousy which women may think lattering -- at first.  Don't be fooled.  Control freaks also don't want you to hold a job or have any money of your own.  You must beg for an ""allowance.""\n\nFinancial:  There are a lot of men who live off women.  They have jobs when you meet them.  Then, something happens, and it's always the company or bosses fault.  They tell you they're out job hunting, but nothing is happening.  Next comes laying around on the couch all day, sleeping, watching tv or guzzling beer.  Weeks turn into months and it's just you working.  Or, the person flits from job to job and can't hold a job.  This man will plunge you right into financial ruin and guess what -- you can't get them out of the house all that easy, if it happens to be your house and not a joint home.  Keep an eye out that they don't dip into your wallet.  A dollar or two missing, here and there, usually becomes much more.  You'll get behind on bills, your credit will suffer.  Don't stand for this.\n\nAddictive behavior:  Drugs, alchoholism, gambling.  Will cause you nothing but stress, pain and financial hardship.  Don't try to be the hero and ""help"" the person out of despair.  Unless you are rich enough to get them into very good rehab, like the movie stars do, it probably won't work.  Addicts can only be helped if they want to be and you'll be surprised how many enjoy the behavior and have no desire to give it up.  I've seen men go to AA or a counseling session, come right out and stop at a bar.  It is almost a joke with them.  You may keep gamblers out of casinos, but they'll spend a whole paycheck on lottery tickets or the football pool.\n\nIllegal behavior:  Selling drugs, stealing, pulls insurance scams, (or any scams), etc., RUN.  He'll eventually get caught and you might get implicated too!  Do you want his record to become yours?\n\nGood luck."

"9","when your boyfriend and you don't talk much yet how do you figure out how he feels about you.?","","I'm generally a quiet person, and I was very quiet around my now-girlfriend when I first met her. I think that likely drove her crazy... because she couldn't tell how I felt about her. After we hooked up and started seeing each other more often, my feelings just came through. I couldn't hold them to myself. There was a need to share them with her that I just couldn't imagine keeping inside.\n\nBut that's me - and not everyone is the same. Some people are emotionally sheltered and prefer to keep their feelings hidden away. Body language, gestures, and general mood and disposition toward you can give you clues as to how your significant other really feels. The question you need to ask, when you're finding yourself actively looking for attention like this, is whether or not you can be happy in the long term under these circumstances.\n\nPeople are tough to change, and if this is something you need, and your significant other is having a hard time dealing with that... you may need to re-evaluate your situation, or have a long and frank discussion with them regarding this."

"4","where did the phrase ""this too shall pass"" originate?","","""This too shall pass"" is the title of a poem by Helen Steiner Rice. \n\nThe almost identical phrase: ""And this, too, shall pass away"" has been traced to an Abraham Lincoln speech. \n\nIt could just be a deliberate reference to the Bible: ""Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."" (Matthew 24:35 and elsewhere). \n\nApparently it was old Persian proverb and a Hebrew parable: \n\n... written three Hebrew letters on the gold band: gimel, zayin, yud, which began the words ""Gam zeh ya'avor"" -- ""This too shall pass."""
"7","Has Anyone ever read the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird?""?","","Yes.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is a 1960 novel by Harper Lee, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It was made into an Academy Award-winning motion picture starring Gregory Peck by director Robert Mulligan in 1962. A coming-of-age story, it is told from the point of view of Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, the young daughter of Atticus Finch, an educated lawyer in Maycomb, Alabama, a small town in the deep South of the United States. She is accompanied by her brother Jem and their mutual friend Dill.\n\nTruman Capote was a lifelong friend of childhood neighbor Lee, and allegedly was the inspiration for Dill's character in her best-seller. Capote frequently implied that he himself had written a considerable portion of her novel, and some have said he ghosted the entire novel. At least one person—Pearl Kazin Bell, an editor at Harper's— has gone on record as believing his assertions were true.\n\nThe title of the book is taken from Atticus's advice to his children about firing their air rifles at birds: ""Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird"". The blue jay is a very common bird, and is often perceived as a bully and a pest, whereas mockingbirds do nothing but ""sing their hearts out for us"". Metaphorically, several of the book's characters can be seen as ""mockingbirds"", attacked despite doing nothing but good. The mockingbird represents innocence, and to kill one is to metaphorically kill innocence. Note that the protagonists are also named after birds: Tom Robinson and the Finch family. However, ""Finch"" was also Lee's mother's maiden name.\n\nHarper Lee stated, ""To get the ideas for the book I used recent events in my time like the Scottsboro Trials."" (Harper Lee, Book Review, 1964)\n\nThe events of this book's publication and the following film are also subjects of the 2005 film Capote starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. It is also an excellent film and will likely be considered in one category or another for an Academy Award."
"7","What is the meaning of Immanuel?","","Immanuel means ""God with us.""  It was used in the Biblical prophets to predict the coming of Jesus (Isaiah 7 and 8) and is referred to in Matthew 1, when the angel Gabrial announces the birth of Jesus to Joseph.  Here's an excerpt from Matthew:\n\nThis is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. \n\n    But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, ""Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,[c] because he will save his people from their sins."" \n\n    All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: ""The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel""[d]—which means, ""God with us."" \n\n    When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus."
"7","Do you generally care about other people, or simply live life for yourself?","","Relationships with others enrich one's own life.  While living for one's self can be rewarding in a more immediate sense, helping others give a sense of gratification that can't be matched by egoistic tendencies."

"2","What are best general purpose binoculars for astronomy?","","It depends.  Just about any binoculars provide good view.  Make certain you stay away from very strong magnifications, otherwise you will need a tripod to keep them steady and may get dizzy without it.  The larger magnifications also limit your field of view.  \n\nI have some 8x42 Nikons that are great.  \n\nJust in case you are not aware:  the first number given in the binocular is the magnification.  Stick with 7 or 8.  The 10s you will need the stabilization electronics or a mono/tripod.  \n\nThe second number provides information on how much light comes through the lens.  \n\nFor example...if you were to compare the same brand and model with the exception of the number difference: 8x25 vs 8x42:  \n\nThe 8x25 will provide the same size image but the 8x42 will provide a brighter image.   If you are thinking about purchasing online...before you do find a camera store or a sporting goods store to see how they feel and get a better feel for what you really want.  Hope that helps...happy star viewing!\n\nAlso another possible source for help would be to see if there is a local star party group in your area.  Drop by one night; it can be fun to meet some experienced viewers with telescopes already setup as well as some people who have the really large expensive scopes which you may not be able to afford."

"9","Is there anything one can do to ""spice"" up what appears to be a dull relationship (marriage)?","We love each other, but, I don't know... it seems to have lost that magic after 14 years.  We are more roommates now.","Here's a hint:  Men like women to show initiative with romance and eroticsm--too often in relationships it's considered the ""man's job"" to get things moving! This will sound corny, but give it a shot:  First, if you've got kids, send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing (say on a Friday).  Next, turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home.  Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table, and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom--or whereever you're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred.  Personally, I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background. Music is important to setting the mood, and if you've got cable or a dish, you can tune it to the music of your choice. Just before he gets home, slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe.  When he gets to the door, be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you've got in store for the evening.  Not in a crude way, mind you.  Most importantly, take your time...don't rush.  The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself.  Hope that helps!\nPeace,\nJayZ"

As long as each person asks like themselves and is not trying to put on an act to ipress the other person it can be great.  Seeing that each one of you accept one another for who you are. \n  On the other side if you feel like you have to be soembody you are not simply to get the other person to like you then the relationship is doomed to fail, because you will eventually get tired of not being yourself.  The relationship will be horrible.\n  Being in a relationship can be the greatest thing ever. All you have to do is comunicate and be yourself and you will be happy"
"2","How are materials exchanged through capillaries?","","Capillaries are thin-walled blood vessels in which gas exchange occurs. In the capillary, the wall is only one cell layer thick. Capillaries are concentrated into capillary beds. Some capillaries have small pores between the cells of the capillary wall, allowing materials to flow in and out of capillaries as well as the passage of white blood cells. Nutrients, wastes, and hormones are exchanged across the thin walls of capillaries. Capillaries are microscopic in size, although blushing is one manifestation of blood flow into capillaries. Control of blood flow into capillary beds is done by nerve-controlled sphincters. \n\n\nChanges in blood pressure, velocity, and the area of the arteries, capillaries, and veins of the circulatory system. Image from Purves et al., Life: The Science of Biology, 4th Edition, by Sinauer Associates (www.sinauer.com) and WH Freeman (www.whfreeman.com), used with permission.\n\nThe circulatory system functions in the delivery of oxygen, nutrient molecules, and hormones and the removal of carbon dioxide, ammonia and other metabolic wastes. Capillaries are the points of exchange between the blood and surrounding tissues. Materials cross in and out of the capillaries by passing through or between the cells that line the capillary."

"5","What's your favorite programming language?","","Well, I just fell in love with Ruby, when I began to learn it a week ago... I've been programming for 15 years and had been seriously hoping to make my own language one of these days, because all the languages I was used to had severe limitations at every turn.  I don't know how to explain all the reasons why I hate conventional languages, but let it suffice to say that Ruby lets you do virtually anything you want to do; it supports a wide variety of programming styles, and can do many things that are difficult or impossible in other languages, such as metaprogramming (the possibilities with this seem endless), arbitrarily changing existing classes (including built-in classes), coroutines (although you'll have to implement them yourself, since Ruby only has continuations built in), lightweight (non-OS) threads, closures, multiple inheritance (well, not exactly, but Ruby's ""mixins"" are just as good), ""freezing"" objects, and on and on.\n\nAlso, after reading through the online book Programming Ruby, I got the feeling that the designer and developer (""Matz"") really knew what he was doing.  The parts of the language fit together well and on the whole, the language is well rounded, with a feature for everyone.\n\nFinally, Ruby is easy to play with, because\n(1) you don't have do define a class and a method and write a ton of import/include/using statements (as in Java/C#/C++) -- code at the top level automatically runs (in a hidden method called ""main"", I think.)\n(2) you get the interactive interpreter called IRB, with which you can type statements and get immediate results.  Multi-line statements (such as method and class definitions) are also allowed.\n\nThe one big problem with Ruby is that it is dynamically typed and interpreted, and thus very slow, although I've heard it is not much slower than Python or Perl.\n\nMy second favorite language is C# 2.0, which has most of the features I would want in a statically-typed language.

AIDS virus is found in blood, semen and vaginal secretions but oddly enough, NOT saliva. \n\n""Fluid contact"" usually involves sexual intercourse, but may also happen when sharing needles, recieving contaminated blood etc. \n\nNot having sex at all provides the best protection, condoms are second best. In addition to condoms, good lubrication is also important, as it prevents the condom from breaking, and small skin abrasions from occuring. Your best bet is to use condoms and KY Jelly -- it's cheap & easy to apply (I wonder why so many people don't use it!). \n\nCondoms are not 100% safe, of course, but neither is driving to work in the morning.\n\nAIDS risk from unprotected o-r-a-l sex is low, but there are other things you can catch that way. A-n-a-l sex is very risky, abrasions are more likely to appear since lubrication often inadequate.\n\n( Yahoo Answers censors some words, hence the dashes.

"3","What are some treatment options for a herniated disc in the lower spine?","","The initial treatment for a herniated disc is usually conservative and nonsurgical. Your doctor may prescribe bed rest, or advise you to maintain a low, painless activity level for a few days to several weeks. This helps the spinal nerve inflammation to decrease.  herniated disc is frequently treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication if the pain is only mild to moderate. An epidural steroid injection may be performed utilizing a spinal needle under x-ray guidance to direct the medication to the exact level of the disc herniation. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy. Therapy may include pelvic traction, gentle massage, ice and heat therapy, ultrasound, electrical muscle stimulation, and stretching exercises. Pain medication and muscle relaxants may also be beneficial in conjunction with the physical therapy. If these conservative measures do not help, then usually surgery is indicated."

"4","Why do people say 'pardon my french' when they cuss?","","Taken from the included link: ""This phrase, in which French refers to ""bad language"", is employed when the speaker feels compelled to use an obscenity despite having listeners who might be offended.  It's a late 19th century euphemism which first appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1895.\n\nIt is thought that the term French is employed in this sense as it already had a history of association with things considered vulgar.  As far back as the early 16th century, French pox and the French disease were synonyms for genital herpes, and French-sick was another term for syphillis.  The OED also equates the adjective French with ""spiciness"", as in French letter for ""condom"", French kiss (1923) and French (i. e. ""sexually explicit"") novels (from 1749)."""

It may also reflect the importance of visitation to the grave, with the stone indicating that someone has been to visit.\n\nRabbi David Wolpe suggests that in ancient times, a shepard counted his sheep at the beginning of the day by carrying the corresponding number of stones, and these were used to ascertain that the same number returned at night. Rabbi Wolpe then suggests that thestones may symbolize how precious each soul is to God, who, as it were, 'counts"" each person in the world.\n\n-->"

"2","what is ""allometric chenge"" in geomorphology?","","Allometry is the study of the relative rates of change of two variables of a system. In the study of landforms, or the processes acting upon them, the power function Y = a Xb is useful for correlating changes in variables. Allometric analysis includes the study of dynamic interrelations during geomorphic history, or the static interrelations at a given time. Such analyses may include aspects of geomorphic open systems that are tending toward a steady state, have attained a steady state, or do not tend toward a steady state. The highly flexible allometric model can be used to demonstrate adjustment between interdependent variables of hillslopes, streams, and depositional environments.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that geomorphic steady states exist, because the dependent variables of a geomorphic open system cannot attain a time-independent state where the independent variables do not remain constant. Independent variables, such as climate, uplift, base level, erodibility of surficial materials, and impact of man, are changing at rates that are sufficiently rapid as to preclude attainment of steady state, particularly for those landforms that require geologic time spans to approach steady-state configurations. For most studies of processes and landforms, a broad perspective of the interrelations of materials, processes, and landforms can be obtained by using the model of allometric change in which landscape elements and processes are changing at different rates."

Alot of jerks act super nice to get into bed with them, and even abusers have been known to act really sweet to the girl to gain their trust and then ruin their self confidence bit by bit, but the whole time, the girl may not see it, they see the ""nice"" guy they fell in love with. They sometimes never realize it was an act all along. Outsiders realize that this guy is a jerk, but the girl is so naive, they think that he really is nice, deep down. Some girls also feel they do not deserve someone nice. I felt this way for awhile after a mentally abusive relationship. I thought noone decent would love me. But I was wrong, and the girls who only date jerks are too. Just hard to make them see it. Find a girl who is ready for a nice guy, they are out there, justhard to find nowadays ;)"
"4","what is an atom?","","An atom is a submicroscopic structure found in all ordinary matter. It is the smallest unit of an element to retain all the chemical properties of that element. The word atom originally meant a smallest possible particle of matter, not further divisible. Later, the objects that had been called atoms were found to be further divisible into smaller subatomic particles, but the word atom nonetheless continues to refer to them.\n\nMost atoms are composed of three types of massive subatomic particles which govern their external properties:\n\n    * electrons, which have a negative charge and are the least massive of the three;\n    * protons, which have a positive charge and are about 1836 times more massive than electrons; and\n    * neutrons, which have no charge and are about 1838 times more massive than electrons.\n\nTogether, protons and neutrons form the nucleus of an atom, which is surrounded by the electrons.\n\nAtoms can differ in the number of each of the subatomic particles they contain. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but can differ in the number of neutrons, in which case they are called isotopes of that element. Atoms are electrostatically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Electrons that are furthest from the nucleus are less tightly bound to the atom and are relatively easily transferred to other nearby atoms or even shared between atoms. Atoms which have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Particles in the nucleus also sometimes escape atoms, in a process known as radioactive decay.\n\nAtoms are the fundamental building blocks of chemistry, and are conserved in chemical reactions. Atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds. Molecules are made up of multiple atoms; for example, a molecule of water is a combination of two hydrogen and one oxygen atom."

"2","What is the seed of sound?","","The speed of sound in air depends on a number of factors - air temperature and pressure.  Generally the higher the altitude the lower the speed of sound.\n\nIn air, sound waves travel at around 330 metres/second (when the air temperature is 0 degrees centigrade). At 40 degrees centigrade (a very very hot day) the velocity increases to 354 metres/second in air.\n\nThe average figure for speed of sound at standard temperature and pressure is quoted as 343 metres per second or 767 miles per hour."
"2","According to news sites, the Earth's rotation slows only 2 milliseconds each 100 years. So why the heck are","...so why the heck have we added like over 21 leap seconds in the past 30 years???!!!!    Something is not right.  If the Earth only slows 2 milliseconds each hundred years, why not just add 2 milliseconds to the clock each century?!!!","nothing to do with daylight savings. Daylight savings is a human invention, not a natural phenomenon.\n\n...because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth's rotation slowing down.\n\nThe amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.\n\nEven that is an approximation, the decimal digits can keep going on.\n\nSo initially, the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days. But about every 4 years, you'd be off 1 day. A century later, you've drifted off by a whole month!\n\nSo, leap years came into effect. Febuary has another day every 4 years. \n\nBut now you've approximated a year to 365.25 days, when in reality, its 365.2425 days.\n\nEvery century, you'll be off 1 day.\n\nSo that's where the next rule comes into play: ""If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, its a leap year.""\n\nNow we've approximated it to 365.2425, but because its always going to be an approximation, our calendar days are always slipping. All because the earth doesn't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.\n\nThis is why leap seconds are added, and not to account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation.\n\nAs to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours, I'm not sure. But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes, or we'd notice that soon enough, its dark at noon! :)  Time was divided a long time ago, and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it, so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with. The lost time, if its accounted for by leap years and such, could be easier to manage.\n\nFirst, I never said the earth is not slowing down. I said its not why leap seconds exist. And ok, I can entertain my explanation may be wrong, but that's no reason for your condescending tone, Jolly Roger. But look, your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site, where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect? \n\nYou haven't bothered to explain his original question. If leapseconds account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation, why are there leap seconds and not leap milliseconds?\n\nIf you want to append to your answer, at least try to do so while respecting the other users on this site, and not insult their intelligence.\n\nThis has piqued my curiosity, if there's anyone out there that has a source that says my explanation is incorrect, I mean an actual science website, you know, one that steers clear of religion, please let me know."

"7","Where did the tradition of Christmas trees start?","","In the 7th century a monk from Crediton, Devonshire, went to Germany to teach the Word of God. He did many good works there, and spent much time in Thuringia, an area which was to become the cradle of the Christmas Decoration Industry.\n\nLegend has it that he used the triangular shape of the Fir Tree to describe the Holy Trinity of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The converted people began to revere the Fir tree as God's Tree, as they had previously revered the Oak. By the 12th century it was being hung, upside-down, from ceilings at Christmastime in Central Europe, as a symbol of Christianity.\n\nThe first decorated tree was at Riga in Latvia, in 1510. In the early 16th century, Martin Luther is said to have decorated a small Christmas Tree with candles, to show his children how the stars twinkled through the dark night."
"1","Why are jews so few in numbers even though their religion came before christianity & Islam ?","","Jews have been persecuted for Centuries for stupid reasons and have been made scrapegoats in many other occasions and forced to emigrate.  \n\nKnowing that you can be expulsed from your country at any time does not make you very enclined to have many children. \n\nAdd to that the millions of Jews who were forced to convert in the Middle Ages and have now lost their heritage...\n\nAlso, Judaism in itself can feel restrictive (food laws as an example) and it tends to be centered on ancestors and ties to the land of Israel which makes it harder to recruit converts."

"5","sbc offers different price rates for dsl.  what is the best if my son will be playing x box live?","is there different speeds with different pricing?  with what we have now he's playing people that have cable dsl and he keeps getting booted off","Xbox Live is just like any online game. The biggest issue you will ever see has to do with Latency, also known as ""Lag"". \n\nLatency occurs when there are bottlenecks in the general network layout. Think LA freeways at 5pm on a Friday night. Unfortunately this issue is not one you can change, because it has to do with the actual design of the network, so choosing your provider properly is essential.\n\nCable Internet, in its basic form, is a shared medium. This means that every person who subscribes to Cable in your neighborhood shares the same on-ramp to the internet. This is only a problem if there are large numbers of concurrent users in your area.\n\nDSL, on the other hand, connects you to the backbone in a more efficient, seperated manner. This has the advantage of being much less susceptible to latency. Unfortunately, this advantage goes down the farther away from the switching office (CO) you are. \n\nAnother thing to consider is newer Cable networks tend to use a different model of communications than the old ones, and so approach DSL levels of service.\n\nTo sum up: DSL is better than Cable, but tends to be slower. However any speed higher than about 1 meg / sec should be MORE than sufficient to run today's games."

"3","Where do my teeth get their ""Wisdom"" from?","I was told by my dentist that my teeth Wisdom teeth must be removed.  \nAm I in danger of losing my ""wisdom""?  \nShould I allow this dentist to ""de-wisdomize"" me?","WISDOM TEETH: IS IT WISE TO REMOVE THEM?\n\nCommon misunderstandings surround their name origin, removal reasons and pain sources\n\nWisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last teeth to grow in the back of\nthe mouth. Common misunderstandings surround their name origin, removal reasons and\npain sources, according to the Academy of General Dentistry, an organization of\ngeneral dentists dedicated to continuing education. \n\n""The name 'wisdom teeth' is age related - third molars don't erupt until teenage\nyears and beyond, when people theoretically are more wise to the world,"" says Trey\nPetty, DDS, FAGD, spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry.\n\nCommon reasons for wisdom teeth removal include impaction, pain and crowding of the\nother teeth, which are typical tooth growth characteristics.\n\n""If wisdom teeth are not visible, they are impacted or unable to erupt due to space\nand size limitations,"" says Dr. Petty. ""Impacted teeth don't have enough room to grow,\nand will lay beneath the gums, which may or may not be a problem."" \n\nPain and tooth crowding are also top wisdom teeth problems. ""Adults have forgotten\nwhat normal pain from a growing tooth feels like,"" says Dr. Petty. Complications also\ncan arise when wisdom teeth partially erupt. The broken gum acts as a breeding ground\nfor bacteria and germs. \n\n""When wisdom teeth partially erupt, food gets caught in the gums and may cause an\ninfection, swelling, growth of a tumor or cyst and pain,"" says Dr. Petty. ""If this\nhappens, consult a dentist before problems worsen and affect overall oral health.""\n\n""If wisdom teeth have erupted, the key to preserving them is maintaining good oral\nhealth by brushing twice a day and going to see a dentist twice a year,"" says\nDr. Petty."

"4","what is the best way to study?","","Many students are surprised at the differences in studying for college courses versus how they studied in high school. Regular worksheets are replaced by vast midterms and exams which require knowledge about concepts rather than simple memorization of facts. Students frequently discover they need to adapt their study habits to the college setting. Here are some tips for getting started:\n\n    * Study in chunks: 20-50 minute time periods followed by a brief break (5-10 minutes) is the most effective way to study\n    * Use daylight hours: an hour of studying during the day is worth two at night! Do the work that requires the most concentration (typically reading) earliest in the day.\n    * Rank your three classes and be sure to spend time on your most challenging class everyday and early in the day.\n    * Study actively: ask yourself questions, review your notes regularly, discuss key concepts with peers and course professor \n\nWhere to Study:\n\nAlthough studying in a dorm room is convenient, it is often a poor place to learn. The dorm has a plethora of distractions including Blitzmail, Snood, the telephone, video games, friends down the hall. Lying down on the bed to read turns into an hour long nap and a bright yellow highlighter spot on your sheets!\n\nIf you want to improve your concentration and efficiency as a student, develop a place to study that is just that - a place where you go to work on academics. The campus is full of good spots to study. Experiment with what works best for you. The handout below provides a list of common study spots on campus and includes rankings of noise level, cleanliness, and availability."

Unlike in other areas of the law, applicants are considered guilty until proven innocent.\n\nYou must convice the visa officer that your life in Georgia is better than a potential life in America.  This is accomplished by showing close ties to your home country.\n\nYou should present evidence of the following things at your visa interview:\n1)  A letter from your employer indicating that you have a good job and are expected to return to your job after you return.\n2)  A copy of your bank statements showing that you have sufficient money to fund your trip.\n3)  A copy of your lease/mortgage showing that you have a home in Georgia that you can not leave.\n4)  Proof of a car.\n5)  Photos of you travelling in other developed countries.  For example, if you went to London on vacation and came back, you are more likely to return to Georgia after visiting New York.\n6)   A good reason to visit America.  I would say that you want to go to Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  Don't say: I want to stay at my cousin's house for three months.\n7) Luck.  Honestly, if your cousin lives in Chicago and the visa officer is from Chicago, you will have better luck.  I once went to a lecture by a visa officer.  He said that he once approved somebody because an applicant was planning on studying in America, but wanted to look at colleges first.  One of the five colleges listed, was the speakers small liberal arts college.  Because of that, the visa was granted."
"7","What is the reason behind the creation of the FBI?","","The FBI originated from a force of Special Agents created in 1908 by Attorney General Charles Bonaparte during the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Bonaparte both were ""Progressives."" They shared the conviction that efficiency and expertise, not political connections, should determine who could best serve in government. Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States in 1901; four years later, he appointed Bonaparte to be Attorney General. In 1908, Bonaparte applied that Progressive philosophy to the Department of Justice by creating a corps of Special Agents. It had neither a name nor an officially designated leader other than the Attorney General. Yet, these former detectives and Secret Service men were the forerunners of the FBI.\n\nBy 1907, the Department of Justice most frequently called upon Secret Service ""operatives"" to conduct investigations. These men were well-trained, dedicated -- and expensive. Moreover, they reported not to the Attorney General, but to the Chief of the Secret Service. This situation frustrated Bonaparte, who wanted complete control of investigations under his jurisdiction. Congress provided the impetus for Bonaparte to acquire his own force. On May 27, 1908, it enacted a law preventing the Department of Justice from engaging Secret Service operatives.\n\nThe following month, Attorney General Bonaparte appointed a force of Special Agents within the Department of Justice. Accordingly, ten former Secret Service employees and a number of Department of Justice peonage (i.e., compulsory servitude) investigators became Special Agents of the Department of Justice. On July 26, 1908, Bonaparte ordered them to report to Chief Examiner Stanley W. Finch. This action is celebrated as the beginning of the FBI."

"4","what is titratable acidity, how is it formed in the kidney and excreted in the urine?","","Titratable Acidity\nH+ is produced from CO2 and H2O (as in the proximal tubular cells) and actively transported into the distal tubular lumen via a H+-ATPase pump. Titratable acidity represents the H+ which is buffered mostly by phosphate which is present in significant concentration. Creatinine (pKa approx 5.0) may also contribute to TA. At the minimum urinary pH, it will account for some of the titratable acidity. If ketoacids are present, they also contribute to titratable acidity. In severe diabetic ketoacidosis, beta-hydroxybutyrate (pKa 4.8) is the major component of TA.\n\nThe TA can be measured in the urine from the amount of sodium hydroxide needed to titrate the urine pH back to 7.4 hence the name ‘titratable acidity’."

"6","IF THE HOUSTON TEXANS GET THE #1 PICK IN NEXT YEARS NFL DRAFT, SHOULD THEY GET REGGIE BUSH?","","Houston has a good young QB in Carr, a good your receiver in Johnson, and a good young RB in Davis.

However, Reggie Bush may be a once in a generation type of player and whatever team passes on him may be looked on historically as we do the Portland Trailblazers for passing on Michael Jordan."

"6","will the seattle seahawks go the superbowl this year?","","No, for two reasons:\n\n1. They're not as good as their overall record (11-2). They play in the uber-weak NFC West which means fat helpings of the Niners, Rams and Cardinals. Yum. They're 3-2 versus teams with winning records (and the Giants game really should have made that 2-3). So I don't think they're that much better than the Giants, Bears/Vikes, Bucs, Panthers, Falcons, Cowboys and Skins--doesn't mean they can't get there, I just don't think they're the overwhelming favorite that their record would indicate.\n\n2.) A lot of the time, teams reach the Conference Championship once and lose at least once before winning and going to the Super Bowl. It's not a lock, it's not certain (and it depends a lot on the competition), but look for the Seahawks to make it to the NFC Championship and lose to someone recently experienced in getting to the next level like the Bucs/Giants/Panthers."

I'm an atheist and I believe in lots of things:  my children's love and the scientific method, for example.  I just don't believe in god(s).\n\nAs for Communism, that was a unfortunate combination of an academic theorist (Marx) and a totalitarian revolutionary (Lenin) -- which is why it's sometimes referred to as Marxist-Leninism.  Lenin and Stalin's terrible effects on the USSR shouldn't necessarily detract from our understanding of Marx's class analysis of society.  Any doubt about whether class exists as a powerful force in the US should have been thoroughly washed away by Hurricane Katrina."

Answers, far too little information exists to answer the question adequately.  Are you disabled?  And you're a student in Merced County, California?  Regardless, the information regarding your situation is far too abstract and ambiguous to provide a concrete answer.  I've included a link to BEST put out by the Social Security Administration.  BEST is the Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool, which does not compute the total sum of benefits you're eligible for, but simply determine which category of benefits are right for you, if you're eligible.  This should be the first step toward determining the total eligible.  The SSA would be able to provide more details for you in your specific situation, since amounts may vary wildly depending on personal facts and details."

"9","Passionate people - do they match well together or spell disaster?","people who feel to the deepest depth, love with all their heart, feel all emotion with every ounce of being...do they stand a chance when paired together? Do they make each other stronger or take away?","This is more of a case-by-case situation. With the understanding that both people are very passionate, the whole relationship could boil down to a competition of expression; one might try to outdue the other in showing how much they care. Depending on the people, this could come out very well, but at the same time, it could end in catastrophe. Another way it could end up going is that one of the two may feel too clouded in the other's show of passion, and feel like they need a break... thus possibly bringing the whole thing to an end. Not a common occurance, but it happens. The last thing i will mention is the more common of the 3, and by far, the best. The two people keep their display of passion limited to a certain amount. this assures that noone will feel drown out, and at the same time, neither of the two feels neglected by the other. I'm not talking about only saying ""i love you"" every 3rd wednesday or anything, those little things are ok to do whenever, but bigger things like dinner dates, trips to the movies, roses and yes, even sex, should be ""rationed"" to make sure you don't burn your candle down too fast and feel that there is nothing more really for you. \n\nIt is possible for any of these to happen, and with some variance, but once again, it all boils down to the types of people involved. Their other traits in their personality and their past will influence which path will occur.\n\n(i love your questions btw, give me more to answer, lol)"

"2","I have to put sulfur in my hair and have been mixing it with aloe vera gel.There is an odor.Is this toxic?","I am concerned with the chemical reaction of sulfur and water (in the aloe) and want to know what is formed.

It is used as a scabicide, parasiticidal, and antiseptic. There are three forms. Precipitated sulfur, sublimed sulfur, washed sulfur. Sublimed and washed sulfur are in the form of a fine yellow crystalline powder, with only a faint odor and taste. Precipitated sulfur is a very fine pale yellow amorphous or microcryst powder, which is odorless and tasteless. I am still looking for toxicity data and I will update my answer if I find anything. I wouldn't worry about using it, the cure is probably better than the illness. But always talk to a doctor before starting any kind of treatments."

"2","Why is it dark when it rains but not when it snows during the day?","","Well to be more precise:\n\nThe mass of rain within a cloud directly affects how much light actually passes through, as the rain mass is somewhat of a solid entity, the light finds it hard to actually pass through.\n\nSnow clouds, and banks, ect are of equal mass, but not density.  Snow is inherently lighter than that of rain, which makes the light pass through them more efficiently.\n\nAlso, you have to understand that the cloud is still producing rain, however within the colder altitudes above the surface the rain is eventually forzen into snow/ice.  Because of this, the cloud releases light at a much faster rate than a true rain cloud would, allowing the light to reflect off the falling ice/snow."

"2","If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around, does it make a sound?","","The answer to this depends on if you are a physicist or a biologist! A physicist would say ""yes"" because to him/her sound is vibration of air molecules which will occur when a tree falls. \n\nA biologist, however would say ""no"" because sound is a perception in the brains of living things capable of perceiving it. The perception is a brain's interpretation of the nerve signals sent to it as a result of vibrations causing the eardrum to vibrate, then the ossicles in the middle ear, then the fluid in the cochlea, then the hair cells etc. There is no sound until a brain perceives it, only vibrating air.\n\nEven if the vibrations are recorded, there is still no sound until the recording is played and heard/interpreted by a capable brain."

"4","In what ways does wildlife extinction impacts our world.?","","There is this really great book called EXTINCTION by the Ehrlichs(?)...which starts out with a beautiful analogy about the environment. It starts off with this guy who removes rivets (screws) from an airplane wing so that he could sell them for profit. Each rivet/screw represents a unique species that plays an important role in our ecosystem. The loss of each one has an adverse effect on the whole structure. It is true that such effects may or may not have an immediate recognizable effect on us but that does not mean that it is not happening. Also, we humans, have proven that we are really self centered that we do not recognize the damage that we are doing unless it hits us in the face. There are countless examples of chain reactions in the ecosystem due to a loss of an integral species. For example, (although I am no longer certain about the details) due to the misuse of a pesticide by farmers in rural Peru, an outbreak of more resistant  pests evolved. The farmers in reaction started to use more pesticides which affected the other species that naturally feed on and control these pests. The situation got so bad that it escalated to such an extent that cats which controlled the rat population died out because they got the higher dose of the poisonous pesticide in their system. Finally, (believe it or not) they had to fly cats to the area and dropped them from helicopters...thus it did rain cats that day in Peru."

"4","how to recieve sounds in an acoustic guitar.?","","Good question.  I'll try to keep it short.  The sound is produced by the string vibrations, this also causes the face of the guitar and other strings to vibrate.  The sound from the vibrating guitar string goes into the sound hole, bounces arround, then comes out out, but louder from the soung hole.  This is why accoustic guitar are louder than unamplified electric guitars.  \n\nIf you wish to use a mic, I recommend an onmi-directional microphone into an amp.  Then you can use the effects loop if your amp has one.  Remember onmi-directional mics pick up from all directions.

There's something in the way that person pronounces certain letters or words. Take T.a.t.u. for example, they don't have Russian accent in songs but you can hear their English isn't really native, you can hear their pronounciation of some letters are different, in some way softer. And Spanish singers, too, they have some softer pronounciation. And I agree with the rest that it's all about the intonation when you sing so that's why you can't hear their accents."

Once you know what type of people you'll be dealing with you'll be more at ease knowing you can handle what difficulties may come from them."
"4","Can anyone tell me how a tablet(medicine) works?","","Many tablets today are coated after being pressed. Some coatings are just to provide color or a smooth finish, or to facilitate printing on the tablet (although characters and symbols are easy to emboss into the tablets using special punches). Coatings are not often sugar-based (the old ""sugar-coating""!) to make pill-taking less unpleasant. Some tablets, however, have a special coating termed an enteric coating, which is resistant to stomach acid and dissolves in the high pH of the intestines. The purpose of this coating is to prevent dissolution of the tablet in the stomach, where the stomach acid may degrade the active ingredient, or where the time of passage may compromise its effectiveness, in favor of dissolution in the small intestine, where the active principle is better absorbed.\n\nTablet presses, the machines that make the tablets, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet at a time, no more than a few thousand an hour, and with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models that can make hundreds of thousands of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. Some tablet presses can make extremely large tablets, such as some of the toilet cleaning and deodorizing products."

"4","Will MBA be a good degree for My Career in Software Industry..I already have a MSCS?","","It depends what kind of role you want in software.  I also received my MS in computer science, but I wanted to take a more business active role, so I pursued an MBA.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  But realize, that if you love to code and do architectural design, then you should stick with what you love, and an MBA won't help.  If you want to take a role at the general manager level or above (anything in strategy, marketing, planning, etc) then an MBA is priceless.  There are some stupid people with MBA's, but don't judge the MBA by a few stupid people.\n\nSo in sum:  First, your career is only good if you are pursuing something you enjoy.  So if a purely technical role is your passion, stay where you are.  If you have a passion for the business itself, beyond the pure technical aspects, then go for the MBA so that you can succeed with your passion."

"7","What is an alpha male?","","An alpha male or alpha female is the individual in the community whom the others follow and defer to. Humans and their nearest species-relatives, the chimpanzees, show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized gestures such as bowing, allowing the alpha to walk first in a procession, or standing aside when the alpha challenges. Canines also show deference to the alpha pair in their pack, by allowing them to be the first to eat and, usually, the only pair to mate. Wolves are a well known example of this.\n\nThe status of alpha is generally achieved by means of superior physical prowess. However in certain highly-social species such as the Bonobo apes, the alpha can use more indirect methods (such as political alliances) to oust the ruling alpha and take his/her place."

They differ in how they choose to understand Jesus' death on the cross -- where a religous historian like Luke would say that Jesus was the ""messiah"" (the Christ, of Jewish Prophesy) and the son of God, Tacitus, refers to him simply as a nussaince and the originator of a ""mischevious superstition"".  \n\nSee below for more info."

"7","how can i get a boyfriend? what do they look for in a girl?","","Be nice to him but don't crowd him.  Don't pressure him to do something with you the first time he talks to you.  Let him get comfortable with you.\n\nA guy will usually like a girl who laughs at his jokes. It shows she is atuned to him. Kind of thinks the same way he does.  It kind of validates his attitude or way of thinking.  It is kind of like you saying to him, ""that is very smart"" without coming right out and saying it.  Of course, only if he said something funny!\n\nAsk him for his opinion, once in a while.  Things like ""what do YOU think?"" or ""which one do YOU prefer?"" are good questions.  They are easy for him to answer if you are asking about something that is in the front of his mind at the moment.\n\nQuestions like ""what are you THINKING?"" are almost always hard for guys to answer, on the other hand.  They may not be thinking much of anything, but if they say that, they sound kind of stupid.  Or they might be thinking about something boring. If they tell you what it is, you will think they are boring. \n\nTry not to put them on the spot like that, at least not until you are at the flirting stage. At that point, you can sort of hint what they should be thinking.  In other words, a question can be a little bit like taking a test.  If you are going to give them one, make sure it is an easy one.\n\nDress nice, of course.  But do not worry about if your clothes or accessories are really expensive.  Know why?\n\nGuys have no idea how much girls' clothes cost. They might not even know how much their own clothes cost.\n\nLots of boys when they are taken clothing shopping just want to get in and get out of that store.\n\nThey might really care about a jacket, true. Shoes, possibly - like if they are into sports and need a good shoe for their sport or running. But pants, socks, belts, shirts - probably just wearing them because they have to.  Jackets and coats are a little different.\n\nIf you want to catch a guy's eye, do some color-coordindation.  For example, if you have a sweater or shirt with some lavendar in it, wearing earings or a hair clip that is exactly the same color will look really neat.  He will think you are a sharp dresser.\n\nThe same thing goes for your eyes.  If you wear a shirt that has some of the same color as your eyes, that might catch his eyes.  Up to ten percent of all guys are slightly color blind though. Details vary, but some guys cannot even tell red from green.  So if doing that color matching thing does not work, do not take it too hard.  Or, try matching two things of a different color than the first one you tried.\n\nI guess if varies from guy to guy but usually a nice hairstyle catches my eye.  If your hair looks nice, he might notice that.\n\nLooking straight into his eyes when you are talking to him.  That might get you noticed more too.\n\nBeing fit, in good shape helps.  You don't have to be super skinny or super strong.  You don't really have to be super anything.  Just be healthy.\n\nAlso, if you are happy and smile a lot, guys like that.  Talking with other guys or girls is good too.  It shows you are social, you make friends easily, and you have friends.  That makes you more interesting, probably.\n\nIf you go overboard trying to do something to make him like you, it could backfire a little.  If you laugh at his jokes when you really don't think they are funny at all, he might sense from your tone or your expression that you are being kind of phony.\n\nSometimes you can be a little sarcastic, kind of dig at him a little with a comment, just to get his attention.  But don't start putting him down or calling him stupid or weak.  That will just get him mad or hurt.  And, even if it doesn't, it will put his friends off toward you. They could start to feel like they need to protect him from you, maybe suggest he find a different girlfriend.\n\nYou could also get him a gift.  It does not have to be something expe"

I had quite an experience that has stayed with me ever since that's too long to talk about here, but it was convincing enough, and I'm not prone to falling for supernatural explanations to explain what I don't understand.\n\nIn a nutshell, you need to be very relaxed and not in a place you can be distracted.  A breathing excercise helps, I use the ""breath in to count of three, hold for four, breath out for 5"" routine.  Get as relaxed as possible and concentrate on raising yourself up out of your body.  If you can concentrate easily it takes less tries of course, but you will actually feel it happen.  Whether that's a dream or not I don't know.  When you get to that point pick a place in the house to go to and concentrate on going there.  It's really simple, and doesn't take a great deal of effort.  This is the stage I was able to achieve, around 1986, when I stopped and never did it again.  Nothing really scary, I guess it just convinced me enough and I left it at that.\n\nGood luck."

"7","Should a professional gambler who file Income Tax as a gambler, report losses & wins from online gambling?","Online gambling is considered an illegal activity, however I feel like I should report my wins and losses in that area just the same as I report them from casinos.  Will I get in trouble with the law by admitting that I gamble online (as millions of others do.)","I agree with the answers provided above, but with one caveat. Illegal business activities are not allowed to deduct business expenses. So reporting the illegal gambling winnings on a Schedule C would mean that no expenses can be claimed. This would subject the gross winnings (from illegal gambling) to Self-Employment Taxes. This will increase your taxes, and not provide you with the benefit of deductible expenses.\n\nSo, I would list this income as gambling winnings, with losses reported on Schedule A as an itemized deduction.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nWilliam"

"8","Why do kids love cartoons and old people love soap operas, and old people shows?","","Because cartoons are geared for a childrens understanding and attention span. Most cartoons are about a half hour long because a kid can only stay interested in a storyline for so long. Older people watch soaps for differing reasons. Some think they can solve the actors problems. Some live through the actors' lives. Some are bored and like the fantasy life of the character. Some, like myself, have watched soaps since I was really little, with my mom. I don't know what you call ""old people shows"" but I like CSI, Crossing Jordan, Las Vegas and American Idol. I don't know what category that puts me in...but maybe I am an old person. Depends how old you are compared to me. You could be right! I still like to watch cartoons too, like Shrek and Toy Story. One of my favorite comedies is Home Alone 1 and 3. So, I guess it depends on the old person, huh? <*)))><"

"2","Why does a Kitchen gas burner glow yellow when a pot of boiling water overflows?","","Good question.   Could be a number of reason, but my guess would be that you have some salt in your boiling water.    When NaCl solution is placed in a flame the Na cation gets ionized and yellow light is given off.    It doesn't take much salt for you to see this effect.   You will see this even with regular tap water, since it also has a small amount of salts dissolved in it.    \nIn fact, standard distilled water is usually not pure enough to avoid this effect.    That's why chemist buy special stills to make ultrapure water for experiments."

A player from one team (the bowler) propels a hard, fist-sized ball from one wicket towards the other. A player from the opposing team (the batsman) attempts to defend the ball from hitting the wicket with a wooden cricket bat, traditionally made of willow. Another batsman (the non-striker) stands in an inactive role near the bowler's wicket.\n\nFor more info on cricket, visit:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"

"3","What causes bad breath and how do you get rid of it?","","The clinical term for bad breath is halitosis.  Bad breath is primarily caused by poor oral hygiene, but can also can be caused by retained food particles or gum disease. Proper brushing including brushing the tongue, cheeks, and the roof of the mouth will remove bacteria and food particles. Flossing removes accumulated bacteria, plaque and food that may be trapped between teeth. Mouth rinses are effective in temporary relief of bad breath. Consult your dentist and/or physician if the condition persists.\n\nIt is important to practice good oral hygiene, such as brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice a day. To alleviate the odor, clean your tongue with your toothbrush or a tongue scraper, a plastic tool that scrapes away bacteria that builds on the tongue. Chewing sugar-free gum also may help control the odor. If you have dentures or a removable appliance, such as a retainer or mouthguard, clean the appliance thoroughly before placing it back in your mouth. Before you use mouth rinses, deodorizing sprays or tablets, talk with your dentist because these products only mask the odor temporarily, and some products work better than others."

"7","whats the best way for ME to get a Goverment grant to start a small business?","","It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."

"10","What are the essential elements of a rule of law in the United States?","One purpose if the limitations impoosed by the american constitutional government is to check the power of the majority. How can this be justified in a political system that is based on popular sovereignty?","The justification for checking the majority rests in the fact that the majority can not use their power to control a minority. The saying majority rules/minority rights is a good example. The majority is in charge but they can not use their power to stomp out a minority or take away minority rights. Also, the fouding fathers wanted to include this so that a dictatorship/kingship couldn't take form. By limiting the majority it limits their ability to take control in such a way."

"5","DSL vs. broadband?","What is the difference? Is there a difference?","DSL is a type of broadband connection.  It stands for Digital Subscriber Line, and is offered by traditional phone companies (wired, not wireless).  The signal travels thru phone lines and into your home or business.  A modem is connected to it so it can translate the signal into ditigal data and then is usually output via Ethernet.  Its main competitor (at least in homes)is Cable broadband.  The difference between the two is that cable generally provides faster bandwith (download/upload speed), but is less secure than DSL, which provides each user with a unique IP (Internet Protocol)address.  Most cable internet home subscribers are connected to a router with up to 255 other subscribers, making attacks and intrusions much more likely."

"9","how do i find my soul mate?","","First of all, to draw the kind of person you want, you must be the kind of person your soul mate would want.

Hang out in the kind of places your soul mate might be---meetings or clubs having to do with your hobbies or work, places of religion if you are religious, online dating sites, etc. Ultimately, I believe it comes down to who you are and what you project about yourself. Don't put on a front, be your true self, and eventually you and your soul mate will find each other. I followed what I've written here and it worked for me. My husband and I are truly soul mates and have been married a little over three years now.

"7","why don't president Bush do something effective to keep illegal aliens out of the country?","","I believe that like it or not nothing effective will ever be done and for this reason... illegal aliens usually come here to make money and create a better life for themselves. With the knowledge that they are illegal they are very willing to take jobs that pay under the minimum wage in order to even have a job. since this is illegal there is no way to get help on raising thier pay so they are stuck. This situation is appealing to the owners of agriculture because they can pay them very little for very hard labor increasing their profits. this in turn helps our economy as well as filling jobs that most americans do not want. So bush probably doesnt feel the need to address this problem."

"5","Where can I get mozillan firefox and is it better than netscape?","I seen question asking if it was better than internet explorer and wondered exactly what it was and where to get it.","Mozilla Firefox is a free, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the Mozilla Corporation and hundreds of volunteers.[1] The browser began as a fork of the Navigator component of the Mozilla Application Suite; Firefox has since become the foundation's main development focus (along with its Thunderbird mail and news client), and has replaced the Mozilla Suite as their official main software release.\n\nBefore its 1.0 release, Firefox had already gained acclaim from numerous media outlets, including Forbes[2] and the Wall Street Journal.[3] With over 25 million downloads in the 99 days after the initial 1.0 release, Firefox became one of the most downloaded free and open source applications, especially among home users.[4] On October 19, 2005, Firefox had its 100 millionth download, just 344 days after the release of version 1.0.[5] Firefox 1.5 was released on November 29, 2005, on the redesigned Mozilla Corporation website, with more than 2 million downloads within the first 36 hours.\n\nFirefox includes an integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, support for open standards, and an extension mechanism for adding functionality. Although other browsers have introduced these features, Firefox became the first such browser to achieve wide adoption.\n\nFirefox has attracted attention as an alternative to other browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. As of November 2005, estimates suggest that Firefox's usage share is around 9.4% of overall browser usage (See market adoption), with its highest usage in Finland (about 30%). Since its release, Firefox has contributed to a reduction in Internet Explorer's dominant usage share.\n\nYou can download it at:\n\nhttp://www.mozilla.com/firefox/"

"2","Natural gas composition?","There was a gas leak in the building at work today.  The plumber, gas company, and other people said that the gas is denser than the air, so it sinks.  I accept that fact, I know there are dangers of using propane heaters in a duck boat because the gas can settle in the bottom of the boat.\n\nBut when I was in 8th grade, we did a science experiment.  We filled up drycleaning bags with the natural gas that comes from the spigots of each lab table (for the bunsen burners).  Then we put in a SASE in each bag, taped them shut, and released them outside.  All the bags floated off.  They were made of transparent plastic.  That implies the gas is lighter than air.\n\nSo why are there warning about the natural gas settling in a basement or other low areas?  I natural gas composed of methane, ethane, propane, butane, etc but in diminishing percentages?","Usually the composition f natural gas is as follows:\nComponent   Typical Analysis(mole %)  Range(mole %)\nMethane          94.9                  87.0 - 96.0\nEthane           2.5                   1.8 - 5.1\nPropane          0.2                   0.1 - 1.5 \niso - Butane     0.03                  0.01 - 0.3\nnormal - Butane  0.03                  0.01 - 0.3\niso - Pentane    0.01                  trace - 0.14\nnormal - Pentane 0.01                  trace - 0.04\nHexanes plus     0.01                  trace - 0.06\nNitrogen         1.6                   1.3 - 5.6\nCarbon Dioxide   0.7                   0.1 - 1.0\nOxygen           0.02                  0.01 - 0.1\nHydrogen         trace                 trace - 0.02\n  \nSpecific Gravity 0.585                 0.57 - 0.62\nGHV(MJ/m3), dry* 37.8                  36.0 - 40.2"
"7","What is the meaning of corporate training?","","Training targets behavior directly, and might indirectly influence thought processes. This typically calls for more than a lecture format. Training might start by specifying steps needed to accomplish a particular task, but more than this is needed to assure that certain skills or procedures are learned. Participants in a training course should practice the desired behavior and receive pertinent feedback to support what's right and correct what's wrong. If feedback is given genuinely in a trusting and caring atmosphere, behavior might not only be directly improved, but one's thinking or attitude associated with the behavior might be positive. \n\nConversely, education focuses on trying to influence participants' cognitive or thinking processes. This kind of education might increase profound knowledge or critical thinking skills, and this could lead to behavior change. If so, I will have ""thought a person into behaving differently."" In other words, education targets thought processes directly, and might indirectly influence what people do."

"5","How to be among the first results on a search engine?","I heard it helps to have the right keywords on the head of the html code as ""meta names""... anyone can help me further?","Allow me to answer this question because I AM on the top #1 spot in three different categories (first names, nursery rhymes, blonde jokes).\n\nCONTENT -- \nFirst and foremost, the content you have on your site is the most important and most crucial thing over anyting else that you can do to your site. What I advise my clients to do is to actually THINK like a search engine or if that is too abstract, think like someone who speaks a different language. \n\nAlthough search engines are getting much better at figuring out exactly what it is that is on the page, remember it is often impossible for them to decipher Java, Javascript, Flash, and other non-HTML components. This is NOT to say don't use them, just use them when they are to be used appropriately.\n\nBecause search engines ARE getting better at figuring out what is on a page, spelling and grammar are also very important. The rule of thumb is no more than three misspellings and no more than three gramatical errors on a page. Sentences should be of short to medium length and paragraphs should also be rather short.\n\nDO NOT COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK. The search engines can penalize a site heavily for plagiarism.\n\nTAGS\n\nTitle Tags -- The most important of all tags is the Title tag. This is what shows up on the bars on the bottom of your computer screen. Most people make the mistake of putting their company name in the Title Tag and that is the worst thing to do (other than putting no tag at all). A Title Tag should be short and to the point and tell what the page is about and if you want to add your company name then add it at the END of the title tag not at the beginning.\n\nMeta Tags -- Meta tags were how search engines would know what was on a page... many years ago. However, with that said it is important that Meta tags are still added to your site and more importantly there are new meta tags (more than just description and keywords) that should be added to the web site such as content type and content language.\n\nMeta Description -- Meta description should start out with the SAME thing your TITLE tag says and then go into more detail. \n\nMeta Keywords -- Meta keywords are words used to describe what is in your page. First use keywords that are in the title and the description first. Then use keywords that are in the content of the page. DO NOT try to spam the search engines by using keywords that are not relevant to your content.\n\nAlt Tags -- With the advent of XHTML, ALT tags for images are now REQUIRED. The Alt tag is used for people who have their images turned off so it is important to have in the alt tag exactly what the image is but also expand on what it is. An example would be a HOME button. Instead of just having HOME as the Alt Tag, use Home -- Site Name.com. \n\nI have noticed that search engines love geography and it is good to put that in there whenever appropriate. If your company is in Kansas City, MO then put those in the Content and in the Tags.\n\nLINKS\n\nHaving links that send people to sites relevant to your site is always a good practice. People ask me where I get links and how do I get people to link to my site. The answer is very simple. First I ask. I write e-mails (NOT SPAM) to sites asking if they wish to reciprocate links with me and I also have on some of my pages a ""Link to this Page"" button so that web site owners can do it on their own.\n\nThere is great debate as to whether links to other sites that are not of the same category help, hurt, or are indifferent. From my ten years experience I have found that appropriate links DO NOT hurt your web site and could very well help in some instances.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nI won't go into much detail here but make sure you have one. So many people forget this and it is extremely important. You will NOT find a major web page that does not have a Privacy Policy attached to it.\n\nTRAFFIC\n\nObviously the more traffic you have coming to your web site the better. Not only ar"

High performance airplanes can make white trails off their wingtips or on top of their wings which is caused by low pressure which in turn reduces the amount of water that is naturally in the air that the air can hold and it forms a cloud.  An interesting side note is that long contrails = high relative humidity, short contrails = low realitve humidity."

"3","how many times is go toget upset during a day?","why i am getting upset?\nwhy i can not save money although i am working?\nwhy i always feel lonly?","When getting upset is not accomplishing anything and interfering with your ability to function, that's too many times.\n\nYou are probably getting upset because you don't feel like you have the power to change your situation.  This will lead to depression.\n\nThe best way to save money is to put a few dollars in a savings account every time you get your check.  If you have direct deposit, talk to your bank to find out if they can do this automatically.  Another practical solution is to make a diary of what, when and how you are spending your money so that you can see where your weaknesses are.  However, overspending can happen because it makes you feel better or in control, so this may be a symptom of depression.\n\nWhen you are depressed, it's hard to feel like people will be interested in you or even like you.  This creates a barrier between you and other people.\n\nTherapy would be your best way to handle this - a therapist could guide you in making changes that will improve your life.  If you can't afford or get access to a therapist, the next best thing is a book called ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" by David D. Burns"

"7","what is the difference between an agreement and a contract?","","An agreement is a commitment between two parties that may or may not be legally binding. For instance, a boy can agree to take a girl to the movies, but there is no contract there.\n\nA contract is a legal agreement between two parties where there is an intent to be bound by one party and an agreement to accept the offered terms by another. The parts of a valid contract are the agreement and consideration on both sides.\n\nConsideration is something that one does that one is not legally bound to do or something that one agrees not to do that one is legally able to do. Back to the date above. The boy has agreed to take the girl to the movies, but the girl has agreed to do nothing for the boy as keeping him company (outside of paid escorts of course) is not something that has real value. So effectively the boys offer is a gift which the girl has agreed to accept."

I learned that the hard way. I always left my laptop plugged in, and in a year my battery was completely dead. From what I know, you should do a complete cycle of the battery at least once a month. That means at least once a month, drain the battery to empty and charge it up again. Dont cycle too often though because that too shortens battery life spans... Soo just keep in moderation. Dont always leave it plugged in, but dont always rely only on your battery either."

No matter what they did, didn't do or could do, I could never say to them ""I'm sending you away to eternal suffering and never want to see you again"".  Now, I'm not even close to being Divine- not nearly as loving or merciful as so many state God is; I'm human and prone to err.  So if I can forgive MY child for anything, how is it that an Omnipotent Divinity that is perfect cannot?  My belief is every soul is recycled until all the lessons needed are learned and then they are accepted into ""heaven"" or to join with The Divine.  It's the only thing that makes sense to me."

"2","Why does a laser shined on brushed alumiun reflect a solid halo, when other surfaces just reflect the red dot?","","The key to your answer is “brushed aluminum.”\nThe surfaces which reflect just a red dot are usually polished or very flat.  This causes them to reflect the laser light just like a mirror, with very little scattering.\nBrushed aluminum, on the other hand, has very tiny scratches on its surface.  The sides of these scratches will cause the laser light to scatter in different directions, forming the “halo.”"

Wouldn't this have worked just as well?","Nobody knows for sure; however, there are many theories.  Below is a very plasable one:\n\nJerome Siegel, of the University of California in Los Angeles, along with colleagues elsewhere, has suggested a third possibility. Writing in a special review of sleep in the current issue of Nature, Dr Siegel says that it may be related to defence against oxidative stress. Smaller animals have higher metabolic rates, and this results in the generation of higher levels of small, highly reactive molecules such as free radicals. Studies on rats show that when they are deprived of sleep, their oxidative stress increases. Dr Siegel proposes that animals with higher metabolic rates need more sleep to interrupt and protect against this kind of oxidative damage, as well as repairing any damage done."

My rates would go around 25-50 an hr depending on the type of services your looking for.\nVideo conferences would be a bit more just because of the cost I would have to eat. Let me know what anyone thinks.","Starting as a virtual assistant is a great idea. (I know, I started that way several years ago.) I do recommend that any of those new to the industry consider your best areas of service before launching and specialize from the start.\n\nUnless you are planning on doing the video conferencing locally, I think you may find that to be a bit difficult to pull off. Not because it can't be done, but because you would need to work with clients that are able to set up the hardware and software on their own sites. Usually, people hire you to solve problems -- and the video conferencing has a serious potential to CREATE problems, especially long distance.\n\nBefore you launch a VA practice, research the name you plan to use for the business (an Internet search is a great place to begin) because you don't want to use a name that's already in use (and possibly trademark protected).\n\nThen consider your strengths and weaknesses. Do an honest self-assessment to determine what services you can offer that will benefit your clients while emphasising your skills, background and education without requiring you to delve into areas that are not your best.\n\nIf you are going to be a VA, a website is essential. If creating a good website isn't your strength -- hire it out or barter services with someone else who can create an effective site.\n\nMarket yourself everywhere you go (business cards at the ready). And, always look for opportunities to talk about what you do -- this is most easily achieved by asking others about their own work (they will usually return the favor). Although Virtual Assistance is a known term in many circles, it still seems to create a bit of interest in casual conversation -- use that to your advantage by begin able to answer questions about the industry in general and your own business in particular.\n\nRead articles by others on the topic of running your own VA business.\n\nBe sure you are willing to put in the hours required to start and run a business. It's not as simple as announcing and starting to work. You will need to research your market, talk with people in the business, talk with people in your target industry/industries, read, research on the web and... PLAN.\n\nBest wishes to you as you begin your endeavor. It's a great career option brought to you by this age of technology!"

The best known symbol is probably that of the Olympic Rings. These five intertwined rings represent the unity of five continents. They appear in five colors on a white field on the Olympic Flag. These colors, white (for the field), red, blue, green, yellow, and black were chosen such that each nation had at least one of these colors in its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914, but the first Games at which it was flown were Antwerp, 1920. It is hoisted at each celebration of the Games.\n\nAre you positive your hinter is reliable?

All brings back to the very reason for existence, very reason why God created mankind. (N.B. I do believe in God) Did God created man so that he could spend his time leisuring, get drunk, fool around, have intercourse for fun etc?\n\nYou asked for opinion and this is mine: No, God did not create us just for fun without any particular reason. The Supreme ONE must have had a cause for all of us. As for me, I believe that we are all created to 'enslave' ourselves to Him. Life is a test, and only His worthy subjects will be rewarded with heaven in hereafter.\n\nSurely, He must have provided us with a manual for us to navigate ourselves in life i.e. finding the true path to Him. Like we when buy a car, the manufacturer provides us with the manual. So it is up to us to look into the manual, or rather to look FOR the manual in any old 'drawer' that we might have misplaced it.\n\nGood luck. May God bless you."

"9","what is orgasam?","","An orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by a notable physiological reaction, such as ejaculation, blushing or spasm and may be followed by aftershocks.\n\nIn a human male orgasm, there are rapid, rhythmic contractions of the prostate, urethra and the muscles at the base of the penis, which (in the adult) typically force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. This is referred to as ejaculation. The process usually takes from 3 to 10 seconds. The process is usually, but not always, extremely pleasurable. Orgasm is generally induced by direct stimulation of the penis. Some men experience heightened orgasm by direct stimulation of the prostate through the perineum.\n\nFollowing ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs during which a man cannot have another orgasm. This period can be anywhere from less than a minute to over half a day, depending on age and other individual factors. A very few cases have been reported of men who appear to have no refractory period at all. Scientists theorize that a pituitary gland disorder or difference may cause this unique ability.\n\nIn a human female orgasm, orgasm is preceded by moistening of the vaginal walls, and an enlargement of the clitoris due to increased blood flow trapped in the clitoris's spongy tissue. Some women exhibit a sex flush; a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman comes closer to having orgasm, the clitoris moves inward under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (minor lips) becomes darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the vagina decreases in size by about 30% and also becomes congested with blood. The uterus then experiences muscular contractions. A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. The majority of women consider these contractions to be very pleasurable.\n\nAfter the orgasm is over, the clitoris re-emerges from under the clitoral hood, and returns to its normal size in less than 10 minutes. Unlike men, women either do not have a refractory period or have a very short one, and thus can experience a second orgasm soon after the first; some women can even follow this with a third, or even fourth orgasm; this is known as having multiple orgasms. After the initial orgasm, subsequent climaxes may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates. Research shows that about 13% of women experience multiple orgasms; a larger number may be able to experience this with the proper stimulation (such as a vibrator) and frame of mind. However, some women's clitorises are too sensitive after orgasm, making additional stimulation painful; they are probably not able to experience multiple orgasms"

"3","does stress cause having a bowel movement to be harder?","","from what I learned at my nutrition school when the body is under stress,  it's called in anthropological terms, the 'fight or flight' syndrome.  whereby your body thinks it is under a threat of some kind and reacts accordingly.  even if in modern times most of what we perceive as a threat is psychological whereas in primitive times we were being chased by tigers!! each one is a different stressor but your body only knows that it feels threatened and creates the same response, tiger or being late to work.  real or otherwise.   \nyour body then produces stress, it copes with whatever this stress is by shutting down diffferent systems so that it can survive most efficiently.  Either by running away or fighting the tiger(metaphorically or literally).  digestion is absolutely one of them.  when in a stressful situation your bowels are the last thing you need to think about if per say, primatively speaking, you are being chased by a tiger.  some people evacuate immediately: diarrhea or hold it in until they are safe: constipation.   if they are under constant stress, then the body perceives this as a signal to continue coping as it has been which could cause constant constipation and/or diarrhea or other problems such as hormonal imbalances(because when you are super-stressed for example having a baby is the last thing your body can handle), weight gain or loss etc..  \nSuggestions:\n(I have a theory, see if it fits).  I have noticed that people who are prone to consipation tend to be holder-oners.  Those who have a hard time lettting go. Whereas people who are prone to diarrhea tend to be letter-goers.  Those who have a harder time facing things and move fast to avoid things.  Both by personal experience and talking with people who suffer from both of these issues.  Take a look at your life, your material belongings and see which one fits...if not.  Then my theory is off)\nYou can look into is meditation or tai chi for calm stress reduction or even martial arts to get some anger and aggression out...stress reduction at it's funnest and finest!!! \nCalcium/magnesium is good for nerve balancing and muscle contraction and relaxation.  make sure you have the right ratio.  especially magnesium( most of America are deficient).\n\ngood luck, \nhang in there...\nhope this helps!"
"6","Why are tennis bracelets called tennis bracelets?","IF people dont wear them while playing tennis then why are they called that?","Tennis bracelets, also known as diamond line bracelets, are thin, elegant pieces of wrist jewelry that feature a symmetrical pattern of diamonds. Unlike charm bracelets, they lack pendants or mementos. \nAccording to numerous web sites, such as Professional Jeweler Magazine and Normans of Mosman, tennis star Chris Evert was known for her diamond line bracelets. She lost one during the 1987 U.S. Open, and the game had to be temporarily halted while she prowled the court for it. The ""tennis bracelet"" incident sparked a new name for the item, as well as a huge jewelry trend. \n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the great Chris Evert, last year Serena Williams wore a custom-design Harry Winston tennis bracelet at the U.S. Open.

"3","What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes.?","","Methods of quitting\nCold Turkey method\nNicotine Replacement Methods (Patch, Gum, Nasal Spray)\nBehavioral Methods\nCognitive Therapy Method\nOther Methods and adjuncts (acupuncture, hypnosis, medications)\nFactors for relapse while in the process of quitting\nPredictors of successful quitting\nCold turkey method\nThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers, people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum, patch or nasal spray. Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process. Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.\nNicotine replacement therapy\nIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin (transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch) , the nasal mucosa (nicotine nasal spray) or the buccal mucosa (nicotine chewing gum). Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms.\n\n      Transdermal Nicotine Patches\n      The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated, and provides constant, steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn. They are quite simple to use, help prevent weight gain, cravings, and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable\n      Side Effects of the patch\n      Patches may cause a local skin reaction,and insomnia with nightmares may occur.\n\n      Overdosing in nicotine is possible, especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch. Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack.\n      Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products...i.e. no smoking or chewing tobacco.\n\n      Cost\n      Patches are expensive and cost close to $100 per month of use.\n      However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $1000 per year, which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car.\n      Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money. Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know. However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system, and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine. the key word here is reliable.\n\n      The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream. The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate, and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this. Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin. Individual differences in skin thickness, location of the applied patch, and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered.\n      3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch\n          o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms)\n          o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled.\n          o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met.\n          o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely.\n\n      It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use, others shorter. If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch.\n\n      Types of nicotine patches\n            Nicotrol\n            15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches\n     "
"5","How good are Dell XPS desktops?","I don't care about Price.  ETA of the system is a major part, I'm willing to spend up to $8,000 on computer, screen, and accessories.\n\nWould a top-notch Dell XPS desktop be a good buy?\n\nBaring in mind I'm not building or buying part seperately.  I am looking in particular for people who have used the XPS 600","I helped a longtime occasional client with the setup of an XPS 600 within the last month - she'd been on Windows 98 about 2 years longer than she should have been, so it was ripe for her to upgrade.  \n\nPhysically, the machine is pretty imposing - it's slightly taller than the standard Optiplex or Dimension tower, and taller than the minitowers you find in most stores (CompUSA, Best Buy, Circuit City, etc.) but the extra size does provide a lot of space for internal devices, many of which you can have preinstalled and configured by Dell.  It's also pretty wide - wider than her old tower by 2-3 inches.  \n\nBecause my client wanted several measures of reliability and backup, we had the system preconfigured with a mirrored RAID array (2x250GB HDs), a DVD+/-RW drive for ad hoc backups, and an external harddrive for scheduled backups that can backup the entire drive.  Since she also wanted to be able to do graphics editing in the future, we got the machine with a GeForce 6800 graphics card (leaving open the option to add a second card in SLI configuration at a later date, if needed, though if they'd offered the option earlier, I would have recommended the 7800 GTX) and got a good 5.1 sound card installed as well (hooked up to old speakers, but WTF - it's her money) and 2GB RAM, with room to go up to 4GB if needed.\n\nFor external expansion, it comes with 8 USB 2.0 ports, and 3(?) firewire ports.  6 of the USB ports are in the back, with 2 firewire, while 3 are in front, behind a small panel.  We actually used most of the USB ports while setting up most of her peripherals, but you can always add a USB 2.0 high speed hub if you have that many additional devices.    If you have older keyboards and/or mice you're fond of that are PS/2, the machine does have ports for those as well.   (My client is still using a 10-year old keyboard from her old 486 PC that ran Windows 95.  I think it's Dorian Grey's keyboard, and has a printout of itself aging in a closet somewhere.)  If you have an old parallel printer though, it does NOT have a parallel port, so you'll need a parallel to USB cable or you'll need to order a parallel port card.\n\nFrom a software standpoint, the machine is very nice to use - everything runs very smoothly (in part thanks to the dual core CPU) with the only hiccup being AOL, which was preinstalled, but still has problems even in version 9.0 with playing well with Internet Explorer, since AOL uses the IE kernel for its own browsing component - running the two at the same time caused problems.\n\nAll in old, I'd say this is an excellent PC, competitive with other high end PCs from boutique manufacturers.  Where it falls short is the ability to get Dell on the phone - even with ""a separate queue just for XPS users"", we were on hold for close to an hour without ever speaking with a representative when trying to find out whether the shipped PC actually matched the original specs fro when the PC was ordered through the website.  Smaller PC vendors, such as Falcon-Northwest, VoodooPC, Monarch, and ABS are much better about being responsive to customers after the sale than Dell was here.  Aside from that, it's an excellent PC."

"1","what is islam?","","The first thing that one should know and clearly understand about Islam is what the word ""Islam"" itself means. The religion of Islam is not named after a person as in the case of Christianity which was named after Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Gotama Buddha, Confucianism after Confucius, and Marxism after Karl Marx. Nor was it named after a tribe like Judaism after the tribe of Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus. Islam is the true religion of ""Allah"" and as such, its name represents the central principle of Allah's ""God's"" religion; the total submission to the will of Allah ""God"". The Arabic word ""Islam"" means the submission or surrender of one's will to the only true god worthy of worship ""Allah"" and anyone who does so is termed a ""Muslim"", The word also implies ""peace"" which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah. Hence, it was not a new religion brought by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) I in Arabia in the seventh century, but only the true religion of Allah re-expressed in its final form. \n\nIslam is the religion which was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind. The name of God's religion lslam was not decided upon by later generations of man. It was chosen by Allah Himself and clearly mentioned in His final revelation to man. In the final book of divine revelation, the Qur'aan, Allah states the following:\n\n\n""This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion"". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3)\n\n\n""If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will It be accepted of Him"" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85)\n\n\n""Abraham was not a Jew nor Christian; but an upright Muslim."" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:67)\n\n              Islam is the way of life for those who believe in God and want to live a life in worship and obedience to none but God. The reward is forgiveness from God and an everlasting life in the Heaven."
"3","How many people on here know about HLHS?","Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. My baby was born with it and her webpage is www.carepages.com and the carepage name is AllisonPatton.","Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a term used to describe a group of closely related rare heart defects that are present at birth. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is characterized by the underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the chambers on the left side of the heart (i.e., left atrium and ventricle). In addition, the mitral valve, which connects these chambers to each other, is usually abnormally narrow (stenosis) or closed (atresia) and the aortic valve, which connects the heart to the major vessels that lead from the lungs (ascending aorta), may also be narrow or closed. Infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have an abnormally narrow ascending aorta."

"10","Is Iraq an artifical country?","","That's a bit of a loaded question, because it depends on how you consider the British role in the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I.  Prior to that war, the Ottoman Empire had evolved over several hundred years, at times encompassing most of southeastern Europe (Romania, Bulgaria, the states formerly composing Yugoslavia), modern Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, all of the Arabian Peninsula, Eqypt, and much of northern Africa.   at the end of the World War I, the Empire was broken up, and most of the administration and nation-building in the area was performed by the British.   While Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan were created based on regional figures of authority (the Shah, the Saudi royal family, and the Hussein royal family (no relation to Saddam)) the other nations had borders drawn largely for convenience.

Substances in soot usually are polycyclical aromatic compounds, or heterocyclical compounds like furanes.\n\nIn the case of impure fuels, additional side products can be found. Presence of halogens leads to formation of dioxines and similar compounds. Presence of sulfur leads to all kind of noxious substances.

And shouldn't the conflict with terrorists be a police action?","A state of open, armed, often prolonged conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties. \nThe period of such conflict. \nThe techniques and procedures of war; military science. \nIn an active state of conflict or contention.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Middle English warre, from Old North French werre, of Germanic origin. See wers- in Indo-European Roots.] \nWord History: The chaos of war is reflected in the semantic history of the word war. War can be traced back to the Indo-European root *wers-, “to confuse, mix up.” In the Germanic family of the Indo-European languages, this root gave rise to several words having to do with confusion or mixture of various kinds. One was the noun *werza-, “confusion,” which in a later form *werra- was borrowed into Old French, probably from Frankish, a largely unrecorded Germanic language that contributed about 200 words to the vocabulary of Old French. From the Germanic stem came both the form werre in Old North French, the form borrowed into English in the 12th century, and guerre (the source of guerrilla) in the rest of the Old French-speaking area. Both forms meant “war.” Meanwhile another form derived from the same Indo-European root had developed into a word denoting a more benign kind of mixture, Old High German wurst, meaning “sausage.” Modern German Wurst was borrowed into English in the 19th century, first by itself (recorded in 1855) and then as part of the word liverwurst (1869), the liver being a translation of German Leber in Leberwurst."

"3","How can a person get rid of a sty (in their eye) ?","","Styes are very irritating and painful and the temptation is great to squeeze them to get rid of them. But this is not recommended as it will only worsen the infection possibly causing it to spread to other parts of the eyelid. Squeezing a stye is counterproductive and should be avoided. \n\n\nTo soften the head on the stye and to ease the pain, use warm compresses several times a day. Take a clean wash cloth and run it under very warm, but not hot, water and place it on the infected eye for 10 minutes. Do this between three and six times a day. \n\n\nMake sure you wash your hands thoroughly after using a compress or even touching the stye. The staphylococcus bacteria in the stye can spread causing more styes. Do not rub an eye with a stye. If you touch the infected eye and then touch your other eye, you will spread the infection to the other eye. It is not uncommon for a child to have a bout with several styes in their eyes over several months from spreading the infection. \n\n\nStyes should go away in about 3 or 4 days. If, however, the stye does not go away and seems to be getting worse see a doctor. You may need an opthalmalic antibiotic solution. \n\nFor more information and more solutions, check the website below. Good luck!!!"

He was 63. \n\nMcDaniel, who lost both of his kidneys about 4 1/2 years ago, died Thursday night at Cy-Fair Medical Clinic in Houston, his oldest daughter said. He'd been in failing health in recent years, often undergoing kidney dialysis. McDaniel was on a waiting list to receive a kidney transplant. \n\nHe was born in Bernice, La., on June 19, 1938, and was a schoolboy football star at Midland (Texas) High School in the 1950s. \n\nMcDaniel moved on to the University of Oklahoma, where he lettered at linebacker from 1957-59. He holds the school record for the longest punt with a 91-yarder against Iowa State in 1958. \n\n""He was a wild, crazy Indian,"" daughter Nicky Rowe said Friday. ""He was bigger than life. He was just amazing."" \n\nThe 5-foot-11, 280-pound McDaniel was selected by Los Angeles in the second round of the American Football League draft in 1960. He bounced around the AFL for much of his eight-year career, spending time with the Houston Oilers, Denver Broncos, New York Jets and, finally, the Miami Dolphins. \n\nBy the end of his football career, McDaniel had already established himself as a big name in minor-league wrestling circuits around the country. But as a member of the Jets, McDaniel began to headline wrestling events at Madison Square Garden with the help of the arena's owner, Sonny Werblin. Werblin also was involved in the ownership of the Jets. \n\nMcDaniel capitalized on the stardom from his gridiron days to make a smooth transition into full-time wrestling. He became one of the country's most popular and beloved wrestlers during the '60s, '70s and '80s. \n\n""He was one of the first to make transition from football to wrestling,"" said Bob Ryder, who operates the wrestling Web site, 1wrestling.com. ""When he found out he was making more money as a wrestler than a football player, he gave up football. He was such a big star."" \n\nOver the course of his 30-year wrestling career, McDaniel had memorable battles with wrestling stars such as ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper and Sgt. Slaughter. He won several titles before retiring in 1989. \n\n""I wrestled all the top wrestlers in the world, and I traveled a lot,"" McDaniel said once. ""I got to see a lot of places that I probably wouldn't have gotten to see."" \n\nHe was also fiercely proud of his Chickasaw Indian heritage and always entered the ring with his trademark elaborate feather headdress. \n\nShortly after retiring, health problems limited McDaniel to one of his newfound passions -- golf. He lived in Charlotte, N.C., until recently, but moved to Houston to live with his daughter and son-in-law as his health began to deteriorate. \n\n""He also became a mentor to a lot of other wrestlers,"" Rowe said. ""He was so famous, I just didn't realize it until now. We've got so many calls from people."" \n\nRowe said the family plans to cremate McDaniel's body and scatter the ashes over a lake near Del Rio, which was once the favorite fishing spot for her father and grandfather. They also plan to hold a memorial service for McDaniel in Midland next week. \n\nHe is survived by two daughters and a son."

"6","Which National League baseball player was the Rookie of the Year in 1947 and MVP in 1949?","","The answer is Jackie Robinson.  In 1947, he became the first African-American player in Major League Baseball.  He was honored as Rookie of the YEar (then only awarded to one player).  Two years later, he was given the National League MVP for a stellar season.\n\nJackie Robinson was a pioneer in the MLB and his memory is still kept alive becuase is his number is retired league-wide."
"8","why do we die?","","The short answer is that certain of our cells are designed to divide only a certain number of times.  Those researching DNA believe that each time a cell divides (and its DNA divides) a small portion at the end of the DNA may be lost.  A longer answer would try to explain why we die too soon but that gets into diet, exercise, smoking, drinking, driving too fast, and poor self esteem; but that would take a book.\n\nLive long and be happy."

All types of diabetes share similar symptoms and complications at advanced stages. Hyperglycemia itself can lead to dehydration and ketoacidosis. Longer-term complications include cardiovascular disease (doubled risk), chronic renal failure (it is the main cause for dialysis), retinal damage which can lead to blindness, nerve damage which can lead to erectile dysfunction (impotence), gangrene with risk of amputation of toes, feet, and even legs.

"2","What is the color of the bear?","A bear is on top of a cliff 200 meters tall. It trips and falls down and hits the ground in 20 seconds. What is the color of the bear?","If it falls down from the top of the cliff to the ground 200 meters below, it'll hit the ground in 6.413696282 seconds if it doesn't strike any object on the way down.  If all it did was to trip and hit the ground still on top of the cliff and took 20 seconds to do so, it probably struggled to remain up (on either 2 or 4 paws) and probably will remain its original color.\n\nHowever, since the bear spent 20 seconds falling a distance that should have taken it < 7 seconds, then it probably fought its way down, bouncing from boulder to boulder, treee to tree, as it fell.  Therefore I expect the bear to be colored some brown (from dirt), some green (from brush), and some red (from torn skin & fur)."

How much should you tip?","Tipping is typically related to service, picking up food from a restaurant hardly qualifies as such.\n\nThere is no hard-set rule to tip for carry-out, but it's not customary.\n\nThat said, it's also your preference, if you feel you should or you visit the place often you might want to consider it.

I plug it into my iMac and the internet connection works fine. I take out the cable and plug it into an ethernet card which is connected to a laptop with a fresh install of XP, and the internet connection on the laptop automagically doesn't work. Windows keeps telling me that the network cable is unplugged. This, of course, is total BS, as the cable is in there snugly. I know that the computer recognizes the card (I checked; the drivers are installed), but for some reason, it doesn't detect the cable which is plugged in. Strangely enough, not only does the cable work with the iMac, but it also worked on the same exact laptop with the same exact ethernet card when Ubuntu was installed. \n\nIf anyone could help, I'd be much obliged.","When you use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to a hub, switch or router, you use what's called an MDI (straight through) cable.\n\nIn order to connect one computer to another directly, you must use an Ehternet cable with a different pinout called an MDI-X (cross over) cable.\n\nThe reason for this is because your computer is a ""terminal"" device.  It transmits data on a specific wire and expects to receive data on a specific other wire.  Then you connect it to a ""host"" device and it expects same thing, but on the opposite wires.\n\nFor more information, see the article on Ehternet on howstuffworks.com\n\nhttp://computer.howstuffworks.com/ethernet.htm"

It sounds like there's a part of you that would occasionally like to be able to lie back, let go, and let somebody else take over. \n\nRape fantasies are also common among women who have sexual shame or inhibitions from their childhood or past relationships. These women often enjoy the rape fantasy because they are not choosing to have sex and therefore are not accountable for any ""sins."" \n\nFurthermore, the fantasy centers on a man who is so caught up in his passion and desire that he has to take you now. The idea of that level of passion is very exciting for many women."""

"3","Which is better for your body: orange or milk?","","People's digestive system is not actually set up to process milk very well. Although you get a good dose of calcium and vitamin D from milk, you can get these things from other sources, without running your system down. Milk and milk products can enhance allergies and intolerances to food and other outside stimuli, and increase mucus production. I don't know if orange juice is 'better' per se, because the vitamins it provides are completely different. I can say your body processes it easier, it gives you a bunch of vitamins, if the juice doesn't have sugary additives it isn't as fattening, and it doesn't have all the nasty side effects that milk can have, (whether you notice them or not... in fact you probably wouldn't notice them unless you cut milk out of your diet and then tried putting it back in). So I guess my vote is Orange Juice."

"3","What is the best medication to fight Multiple Sclerosis?","I have MS, beem diagnoised 11-2002, I am 56 years old, and have been taking LDN and doing just fine, concedering, so far.","Holy christmas (literally!)... the last poster, be careful.\n\nI was diagnosed in 1999.  I didn't start taking medications until 2004 (had a bit of denial there)...\nI got a flare-up that forced me to think harder about my future (and a great fiance to boot!).\n\nA lot of people go on the interferons, and Glatiramer acetate, which is what I'm on.  When I decided what to go on, I thought about what I'd have to do for it.  I was a bit worried about giving myself a shot, and I figured that I would need to have the least intrusive method of medication delivery... so I decided subcutaneous (just under the skin).  That cut down the list of interferons... \n\nThen I thought about side effects, a lot of the interferons have flu like symptoms.  When I started the meds, I was feeling weak, pins and needly, and limpy.  I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that.  No siree.\n\nI mean, you really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends.  It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!).  That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place.  My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone.  Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect.\n\nI WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots.  Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so you don't even have to see the needle.  Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs.  I gave it to myself without hesitation the first time!  I am a little wary of someone else doing it (though she had recommended that my fiance learn how, too).\n\nResult?

"2","why is the sky blue?","it's the age old question....","The sky appears blue because the gases(mainly nitrogen and oxygen) present in our atmosphere vibrate at a specific frequency.  From the light that we can see, ie.. blue, green, red, yellow...etc, the the higher frequency colors are absorbed more by the atmosphere than the lower frequency(actually they're scattered, they still make it to us but indirectly whereas the yellowish color of the sun is more direct).  So blue, green, and violet(violet having the shortest wavelength) are absorbed by the atmosphere, while red, yellow and orange are allowed through.   The color of blue that we perceive the sky varies from day to day based on the content of gases present and the frequency that they vibrate.  It works the same way as light passing through a blue balloon, except in this case the balloon is our atmosphere."

"2","Has an organ been cloned as of yet?","I awas having a debate with my husband over whether or not scientists have cloned an organ. I say they have, he says they have not. I thought, however, with the stem cell research, this was the whole point...to get the stem cells to grow into whatever organ was needed?!\n\nDoes anyone have any answers to clarify this debate?","At this point, it isn't possible to grow organs, but at some point this may be possible. The idea would be to take some cells and ""instruct"" them, by giving the right amounts of certain molecules, to grow into certain types of cells that would form an organ.\n\nIt will be easier to make replacement cells of a certain type, such as bone marrow, or nerve cells, than to make a whole organ that has many types of cells and a complex architecture. We're still trying to learn all the signals that go into telling cells how to become one type versus another, so there is still a ways to go.\n\nThe stem cell issue comes in because most cells in the adult have already decided what they will be when they grow up, and they can't go back and become anything different. Stem cells haven't decided yet, so they could be ""told"" what to be, when we know all the instructions. The research is very slow now in the United States, because of limitations from the government, but other countries are pulling ahead nicely (and some of our best scientists are leaving to go to those places)."

"5","how to link an Access database to a C++ application?","","There are a variety of ways to connect to an Access database from within a C++ app.\n\nThe oldest and most widely compatible is ODBC. It's not as fully featured as some other technologies, but it's the standard minimum compliance of pretty much everything.\n\nIf you're running on Windows, I'd suggest using ADO or ADO.NET.

I e-mailed the web site and within a half-hour, I received an apology stating the problem had been corrected. Sure enough, when I accessed the site using Internet Explorer, the error had been corrected but when I accessed it using Netscape 7.2, it still had the incorrect posting and remains so nearly 24-hours later. When the tour, currently on break, was posting it's updates after each show, there was almost always a lag of a couple of hours before the same update could be viewed through both browsers. Why should there be any difference at all, once the update has posted, just because a different browser is used?","Because every browser has its own memory of what pages looked like, and its own policies (set by you in the Preferences) for when to use that memory. Go back to rolling stones, (the exact page), hold down the shift key and press F5. This should fix it."

"1","Why is marijuana illegal and alcohol still legal?","It seems that marijuana has less negative effects than alcohol. Why was marijuana outlawed in the U.S. and not alcohol?","Because alcohol contains only alcohol. The effects upon the brain are well known and documented. Marijuana, on the other hand, has hundreds of chemicals, each possibly interacting with the other(s) in ways not yet researched. For instance, a well-known drug test involves snipping off a bit of your hair. if you smoked pot even six months ago, traces of it remain detectible as part of the hair itself, vs. the kidneys elimination if all traces of alcohol from the body within 48 hours. Also, it is suspected that pot may alter the body's DNA, so long-term chronic effects are still unknown."

The first one to touch the Princess hand would be the winner and become the new King.\nThe rules of the test were that the contestants could not walk over the carpet, cross the plane of the carpet, or hang from anything; nor could they use anything but their body and wits (i.e. no magic or telepathy, nor any items such as ladders, block and tackles etc).\nOne suitor figured out a way and married the Princess and became the new King.

"2","how big is the moon?","","How big is the moon?\nThe moon is about 2,000 miles across. \n\nHow far is it from Earth to the moon?\nIt is about 250,000 miles from Earth to the moon. \n\nHow old is the moon?\nThe moon is the same age as the Earth and the rest of the solar system — about 4.5 billion years. Our solar system was all formed at that time. \n\nHow did the moon form?\nWe think that the moon and Earth formed at about the same time, back when our whole solar system was formed. Earth was forming from many chunks of rock and icy material. Possibly a big chunk hit the new Earth and knocked loose a big piece, which became the moon. \n\nHow hot and cold does it get on the moon?\nAs you may have learned, the moon doesn't have any air around it. The air that surrounds our earth acts as a nice blanket to keep us warm and comfy! But the moon, since it doesn't have this blanket, gets much colder than the earth — and much hotter than the earth. On the side of the moon that the sun is shining on, the temperature reaches 260°Fahrenheit! That is hotter than boiling. On the dark side of the moon, it gets very cold, -280° Fahrenheit. \n\nWhat is the surface of the moon like?\nThe surface of the moon has about two inches of dust. Much of this dust has fallen to the moon from the spaces between the planets over the last several billions years. It probably feels pretty soft. You can see this in some pictures taken by the astronauts of their footprints on the moon. \n\nHow many holes are in the moon?\nWe call those holes ""craters."" They are the places where many years ago meteors hit the surface of the moon and put dents into it. There are thousands of big craters, but even more little ones. There are probably millions of little craters on the moon! Some are only an inch or so across. \n\nWhy does the moon have big rocks?\nThe moon is made up of various kinds of rocks. These rocks are fairly similar to the rocks on earth. But on earth, we have wind and rain that help wear the rocks down into sand and dirt. There is no air or wind on the moon, so the rocks don't get worn down as they do on the earth. \n\nHow many moons are there all together?\nEarth has only one moon. If you count all the moons around all the planets in our solar system, there are 61 (Earth has one, Mars has two, Jupiter has 16, Saturn has 18, Uranus has 15, Neptune has 8, and Pluto has one). There may be more that we haven't discovered yet! \n\nWhy does the moon change its shape (as in full, half, and quarter moon)?\nThe bright part of the moon is the part that the sun is shining on. This is like daytime on earth. The dark part is in shadow, like night on earth. Now the moon goes around the earth once every 29 days (approximately). \n\nAt new moon, the moon and the sun are on the same side of Earth. We see the part of the moon that is in shadow, so the moon is dark. Then the moon moves around in its orbit. At first quarter, it has gone one-fourth of the way around Earth. Now we can see part of the moon that is sunlit, but part still in shadow. Note that if the sun is setting in the west, the bright part of the moon is on the side toward the sun and the dark part is away. \n\nAbout a week later, the moon has moved halfway around its orbit. Now it is on the opposite side of Earth, away from the sun. Now we see only the sunlit side — that is the full moon. Note that if the sun is setting in the west, the moon is just rising in the east. \n\nAbout a week later, the moon has moved now three-fourths of the way around in its circle around Earth. Once again only part of the moon is sunlit and part is dark. Now you can see the moon in the morning, and note that once again the sunlit side is on the side towards the sun, and the shadow side away. Another week and we are back to the new moon. \n\nIt's easier to demonstrate if you have a ball to represent the moon and a flashlight for the sun. Have someone stand several feet away, holding the flashlight so it shines on the bal"

"7","Where did the dollar go?!?","Three friends check into a motel for the night and the clerk tells them the bill is $30, payable in advance.  So, they each pay the clerk $10 and go to their room.  A few minutes later, the clerk realizes he has made an error and overcharged the trio by $5.  He asks the bellhop to return $5 to the 3 friends who had just checked in.  The bellhop sees this as an opportunity to make $2 as he reasons that the three friends would have a tough time dividing $5 evenly among them; so he decides to tell them that the clerk made a mistake of only $3, giving a dollar back to each of the friends.  He pockets the leftover $2 and goes home for the day!  Now, each of the three friends gets a dollar back, thus they each paid $9 for the room which is a total of $27 for the night.  We know the bellhop pocketed $2 and adding that to the $27, you get $29, not $30 which was originally spent.  Where did the other dollar go????","The $2 should be subtracted from the $27, not added to it -- since they were overcharged by $5, the room actually cost $25.\n\nThey ending up paying $27, $25 for the room and $2 to the bellhop.

It is true that certain distiguishing features arise from populations centered in different climate zones.  Human populations origionating from northern Europe and Asia have much lighter pigmented skin than those from closer to the equator.  However, there are unexplained reasons as to why southeast Asians developed differently from the populations of Africa.

"7","how do you know if someone put a lien on your house.?","","First of all, if a lien was place, you should have received something in the mail that indicated such.  If you didn't, get down to the County Recorder's office and do a search on your parcel number.  It's quick, free and easy."
"2","how if the gravitational force is occuring due to any energy then it may be converted to some energy ?","","Gravity attracts an object with mass towards the center of the earth.  You must do work, expending your own energy, to overcome gravity and raise a weight.  The weight now has potential energy equal to the weight times the distance raised.  If you raised a 100 Lb weight one foot, you did 100 ft-Lbs of work on the weight and the weight now has 100ft-Lbs of Potential Energy that can be used to do work, such as lift another weight on the other end of a seesaw.  All of the energy discussed derives from the earth's gravitational field which has been converted to mechanical energy.  You could perform the same task on the moon except the amount of work and potential energy would be far less because the moon has less gravity.  Also a pound weight on earth would weigh far less on the moon and scientists would usually use units of mass which is constant on the moon and earth to perform calculations."

"2","How much mass is Earth converting to energy per unit time to generate its gravity?","","The previous answer described gravity in the Newtonian sense, but Einstein had a very different explanation. He said that massive objects cause space to warp (like placing a bowling ball on a trampoline). Massive objects are ""attracted"" to other massive objects because they fall into these gravity wells. Thus, there is no energy conversion, only a tendancy for objects to follow the path of least resistance through space (as when you place a marble on the edge of the trampoline and it ""falls"" inward toward the bowling ball)."

"4","how can i find my birth number without any trouble?","","Hi...\nThe birth date describes who we are, what we are good at and what our inborn abilities are. It also points to what we have to learn and the challenges we are facing.The birth number is only one puzzle piece in a total numerology reading. The information given here is meant as an introduction to numerology.\n\nDue to repeated requests I have also added the double digit master numbers 11, 22 and 33. I still recommend that you get a full numerology reading to get the total meaning of these numbers in your life. I also want to point out that those who have double digits are always influenced also by the single digit meaning of number.\n\nTo figure out your Birth Number, add all the numbers in the birth date together like in the example until there is only one digit. The Birth Number does not prevent you from being anything you want, it will just color your choice differently.\nExample: March 20, 1950\n3 + 20 + 1950 = 1973 = 1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20 = 2 + 0 = 2"

"5","How to save arrays in MySQL with PHP?","How would one save an array in MySQL using PHP?","If you are using the native mysql drivers in PHP, then there are no MySQL arrays, you are creating an object that you iterate over. The idea is to iterate over the object's results and put those results into an array. Observe:\n\n<?php\n// Connecting, selecting database\n$link = mysql_connect('mysql_host', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password')\n   or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());\necho 'Connected successfully';\nmysql_select_db('my_database') or die('Could not select database');\n\n// Performing SQL query\n$query = 'SELECT * FROM my_table';\n$result = mysql_query($query) or die('Query failed: ' . mysql_error());\n\n// Printing results in HTML\necho ""<table>&#92;n"";\nwhile ($line = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {\n   echo ""&#92;t<tr>&#92;n"";\n   foreach ($line as $col_value) {\n       echo ""&#92;t&#92;t<td>$col_value</td>&#92;n"";\n   }\n   echo ""&#92;t</tr>&#92;n"";\n}\necho ""</table>&#92;n"";\n\n// Free resultset\nmysql_free_result($result);\n\n// Closing connection\nmysql_close($link);\n?> \n\nThe line you are looking for is:\nwhile ($line = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC))\n\nBasically, mysql_fetch_array will return an associtive array containing the column name as the key, and the data for that column into $line. Then you can further push that into an array container.\n\nvar $data = array();\n...\n$data[] = $line;\n...\n\nYou cannot otherwise take a mysql result and make it an array, you must iterate over the object.\n\nFYI - I do not reccomend using the native PHP drivers. Using an abstraction library makes your code so much more portable. Using native drivers may make for quick coding, but you loose so much more in the end. \n\nI've included links to Pear::DB, ADODB, and PDO as possible libraries to look at. There are more, these are just examples.\n\nHope that helps."

They are interested in getting him a bike that will fit him and are experienced in the industry.  Don't buy from WalMart, or Academy, or department stores, where the sales help is usually clueless.  The average ""department store"" bike gets less than 100 miles on it before it hits the dumpster - and for good reason - they aren't fun to ride because the quality is so poor.  Even for a kids' bike that you expect him to outgrow in a couple of years can be handed down to a sibling or friend.  You'll pay a little more, but the piece of mind knowing that his bike will hold up to the crashes, getting dumped in the yard, jumping curbs is worth it.  \n\nYou can get good kids' bikes in some of the main brands - Giant, Trek, Specialized, etc.  They will be good quality.  (Note, if you are as old as I am, Schwinn was the thing to get when you were a kid - but they are no longer.  The name was bought out by a very low end, cheap company (Pacific Mongoose) and the quality has gone way downhill.)\n\nAnd as everyone says: get a helmet & a pump.  The tires should be aired at least once a week (they will lose ~10% of their pressure *each* night)."
"5","what is vitrual memory?after about 20 mins, pc pops up with this message vitrual memory low, what can i do?","","Since the main memory (RAM) is expensive, it usually has lesser capacity than the hard drive.  However, the problem with that is the RAM gets filled quickly with all your running programs.  However, the CPU (processor) multi-tasks, hence it doesnt need the programs (data and instruction words in the RAM) all the time.  Thats where the virtual memory comes into picture.  Virtual memory is basically part of the drive which is used as a temporary ""parking space"" for data and instruction words which can't be held in the RAM.  When programs are no longer requred they are ""swapped"" to the hard drive from the RAM and shuttled back to the RAM when the CPU gets ready to process them (depending upon the scheduling algorithm).\n\nYou are getting the error because you have assigned less virtual memory (or the system has assigned less vitual memory).  Hence, when the RAM gets full, its doesn't get any ""parking space"" on the hard drive and you get the error.\n\nIn order to bump up the virtual memory and improve system performance, view the following page.  It is really helpful!"

They invest in super safe securities such as short term bonds and t-bills. They are completely liquid (you can make withdraws whenever).

The actual amount of added material depends on each study, though it is estimated that 10 to the 8th power kilograms of in-falling matter accumulates every day.

"7","best way to invest money...risks doesnt matter for me?","","It's been mathematically ""proven"" that you can get high returns AND reduce your risk by buying diverse high-risk investments which have no correllation.\n\nAlso, Equities (Stocks) have had some of the best returns historically, and are still considered a very good investment.\n\nOf course you don't want to be STUPID about it and buy the riskiest stuff possible.  Get some AGGRESSIVE mutual funds with low fees (Vanguard has some).  Spread your money around to highly aggressive funds that have little correllation.  For instance, some Domestic High Growth, some Foreign aggressive growth, maybe some Real Estate Trust Funds, some High Tech, Some Health Care.\n\nLook at the historic returns of the sector and the fund.  Look too at the risk vs. return.  If, as you say, risks don't matter, then go for high return funds, with a reasonable risk.  And spread it around - but make sure you spread it around to different TYPES of investments - all that are aggressive, but some that move contrary to each other (like foreign vs domestic, or REITs vs Stock)"

I've tried a number of messengers - Yahoo silently loses messages, as does GTalk. MSN usually notices that it can't deliver, but sometimes silently loses messages, and never re-attempts delivery. I haven't tried AIM yet (I've had a little bit of trouble with it and my firewall), but I don't have a good reason to expect it will work better.\n\nIs there a program I should be using to communicate? The ideal solution would notify me when it fails to deliver a message, and continue trying to send it for a period of time, but not spam the recipient with multiple identical messages when the packets go through. I need to run it on Windows XP, and having to run my own server is a disadvantage, but one I can handle.\n\nDoes such a program exist, or should I dig out my networking books and start looking into reliability engineering?","I have found the new Yahoo Messagenger to be good at what you need. Now that it has a ""memory"" of the messages sent by the person, and it has the feature of waiting for the message to be read by the reciever.

So that would probably be left up to a vote and take a consensus. \n\nAs for picking answers myself, if there appears to be a lot of thought put into the answer and it includes sources, all the better. The questions that I've personally asked, thus far, usually there has been one answer that typifies this. Now, if I received several long responses that have merit, I would be inclined to let the users pick."
"7","Titanic Questions?","How could an iceberg hit an unsinkable ship?\nWhy did lower classes have to wait?Isn't it the crews fault for not letting them go and for almost 1,500 people dying?Why didn't Titanic have enough life belts and life boats?Why didn't they prepare for something like this? Finally, why did people want to take and sell treasures found on the Titanic? Shouldn't Titanc's victims rest in peace?","The answers to your questions in the order asked:\n\n(1) Any ship can hit an iceberg, it's not like the iceberg is living and could have moved out of the way because it WANTED to. \n\n(2) In those days, the poor were considered ""third class"" individuals, and so on the ship were put into the ""third class"" accomodations. As such, the crew was directed to make sure the first and second class passengers were attended to first. That wasn't right to do at all, but that's just how it was. \n\n(3) It's mainly the fault of the shipbuilders who only put 20 lifeboats on the ship, which wasn't enough for half the passengers. Sharing in the blame would have to be the officer who tried to turn the ship when it was too close already, since the ship wouldn't have sunk if it hit the iceberg head on. It was also the captain's fault for not taking the necessary precautions with the ship when he knew they were headed directly into an ice field.\n\n(4) The shipbuilders wanted as much ""ooh and ahh"" over the ship as they could get from the public. That's why they fostered the belief that the ship was ""unsinkable"", and that the ship itself was one big lifeboat. Those in charge also felt that the extra boats would have cluttered up the ship's deck. \n\n(5) They didn't prepare for this because they were arrogant and felt that they had the greatest ship in all of history and nothing would ever happen to it.\n\n(6) Greed is why people tried to take and sell Titanic artifacts. It was all about the $$$. \n\n(7) Titanic's victims are long-gone. Either they were consumed by organisms at the bottom of the ocean, or like anyone in the grave, their bodies returned to the dust."

"10","What was Woorow Wilson's reson for the cause of WWI?","","Following is the beginning of the President’s message to the 65th Congress concerning that war.  The complete message may be found at the source link:\n\nGentlemen of the Congress: \nI have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making. \nOn the 3d of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the 1st day of February it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean. That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats. The precautions taken were meagre and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed The new policy has swept every restriction aside. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents. Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were provided with safe-conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle."

I only have once exception; HITLER, DIE NAZI DIE!","As long as the person is guilty, and the crime is severe, I think it is a good thing.\n\nFor one thing, why should a cold blooded murder get the chance he never gave to his victim?  Victims (usually  innocent people) do not get a chance to start a new life, do they? Plus why should he get a lifetime of freebies (free meals, free clothes, free cable) and even some freebies that the law-abiding cannot afford (like free gym, free college courses) after taking a life?\n\nA good alternative would be to use the worst of the worst (rapists, pedohiles, murderers) for testing instead of the innocent animals.

"4","When was the Parthenon built and why?","PLease answer this by December 20th, please. I need this for a test to study! URGENT!","The work on Parthenon started in 447 BC.  Work on the temple continued until 432 BC.  The Parthenon is a Doric peripteral temple, which means that it consists of a rectangular floor plan with a series of low steps on every side, and a colonnade (8 x 17) of Doric columns extending around the periphery of the entire structure. Each entrance has an additional six columns in front of it. The larger of the two interior rooms, the naos, housed the cult statue. The smaller room (the opisthodomos) was used as a treasury.\n\nSome historians believe that Athens concluded a peace treaty with Persia in 449, two years before work began on the Parthenon. The significance of this would be that the Delian League/Athenian Empire continued to exist, even after the reason for its existence (a mutual defense league against the Persians) had ceased to be valid. In other words it was now openly acknowledged that Athens was not just the head of the Greek defense league but actually an imperial master over other Greek states. The decision by the Athenians in 454 BC to move the League treasury from the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delos to the Athenian acropolis points in the same direction. Because the Parthenon was built with League funds, the building may be read as an expression of the confidence of the Athenians in this newly naked imperialism."

"9","how could you satisfy your girl friend?","if you can","The truth is this, there is no way to satisfy your girlfriend, or anyone, for that matter.  Men and women, it seems, have this belief that they can ""please"" each other or ""make"" each other happy.  It is a nice thought, but it doesn't really happen that way.  Think about this, you are upset and your friend tells you a joke that makes you feel better...right?  Wrong.  You chose to feel better by seeing the humor in the joke and allowed yourself to open up enough to be influenced by the humor, losing your grip on those negative thoughts and feelings you had previously.  It is the same with women, in this case, your girlfriend.  \n\nYou can't satisfy her, but there is something you can do to improve the situation.  First start with you, being the best person you can be...to yourself, to others, and to her.  Be confident, be yourself, be all the things you want to be when fear and self-consiousness set in, and be true to who you are.  Then be selfless, helpful, caring, compassionate, diligent, and patient with those around you.  As for your girlfriend, you should follow your heart, care for her, give her yourself, be WITH her when you are around her, share, be thoughtful and kind, and show her that you care.  Although you cannot ""force"" or ""make"" her do anything, you can still be the best person possible, making each day you live worth living, making yourself a person of value, and creating a certain magic in your life.  All of these things will not only draw better people to you in your life, but your girlfriend will be more ""open"" to your influenc and ""willing"" to share whatever you wish with you.  \n\nA last note.  Women ""feel"" rather than ""think"" their ways into better relationships.  Men are mostly the other way.  If you love her and care for her, you should take the risk and tell her what is in your heart as often as you can, show her what you feel without the ""act"", and do for her what you would want done for yourself.  The best advice in any relationship, including the one you have with yourself, is this: ""If you don't want people to treat you like an @ssho!e, then don't act like one"".....in your case it would sound more like this ""If you want to satisfy her, then let her satisfy you"".  Do all the things to her that you want her to do to you (or have done to you, if you are content in the relationship).  Relationships are a balance, and if yours needs some adjustment, then make those adjustments.  Don't worry if you think you are working too hard, when she realizes what you are doing, she will be more than willing to do her part as well (if she is right for you, that is....and doing this will give you a good indicator if she is or isn't ""the one""....)\n\nI hope this helped.  Good luck!"

I believe you mean the XM and Sirius satellite radio.  The channels are the same no matter where you go, the same name and the same channel number.  It is different from FM/AM radio as there could be other stations use the same frequency but in another region.  Satellite radio is meant to broadcast all over the U.S. as FM/AM is not meant to.  \n\nIt is the same with television stations.

"2","Could we all become separate species..?","Looking at the various cultural and genetic drift that is visible on our planet today, and the wide variety of human types, is it plausible to suggest that we could all one day adapt and evolve into separate, unique species who are no longer able to interbreed and have unique characteristics?","Given today's atmosphere (socio-economic, not the sky), it is not possible.\n\nLook to Darwin to see WHY species differentiated.\nOne reason is they change to better thrive in their surroundings.  We humans tend to alter our surroundings to more fit us.\nAnother reason is physical barrier (and then go back to number one), so two populations evolve differently...due to their different surroundings.  The only problem is that I live next door to an Italian, an American Indian (1/8), and a Pakistani.  World travel is a thing of relative ease.  Breeding is so intermixed between populations that you will not have a barrier-method break to help evolution.\n\nIn summary, I believe we will not become different species of human."

I have found that if people say ""I went to school in Massachusetts"" then people just say ""oh, where"" and it drags on the conversation.  I think it's really arrogant to think you're so special you have to try to hide where you went.  If you went to Harvard and someone asks, then say ""Harvard"" and move on.  If you went to Yale, don't say ""Connecticut"" because that just invites follow up questions.  Just say ""Yale"" and move on.  I think it's worse and more arrogant to try to hide where you went than to just answer a question factually if people ask.

(This belief allegedly dates to the 3rd century BC in Greece.) Because of the hand-heart connection, people named the putative vein descriptively vena amori, Latin for 'the vein of love'. Due to this tradition, it became accepted to wear the wedding ring on this finger. By wearing rings on the fourth finger of their left hands, a married couple symbolically declares their eternal love for each other. This has now become a matter of tradition and etiquette.\n\nIn most Western cultures, the wedding ring is worn on the left hand. In some countries, however, such as Germany, Norway, and Chile, it is worn on the right hand. Orthodox Christians, Eastern Europeans and Jews also traditionally wear the wedding band on the right hand.\n\nEtiquette frowns severely on the making of sexual overtures to a man or woman wearing a wedding ring.""\n\nFor wedding invitations, be sure to check out http://announcements.com \n\nThey have a huge selection, and usually ship within 2 business days."

So the agent advised us to sign as a couple which I now know was bad advise.  Because the relation didn't work after 18 months. and now my ex girl is sueing for half interest in the house after 25 years of no payment on the mortgage or upkeep of the property--I plan to represent myself in court due to the lack of fund to hire a lawyer. I do not see her as co-owner. She left the house in 79 and expressed no interest in the house an d took all household goods.  I beleive she've been compensated for the limit $ invested at closing.  She is filing co owner.  Any advise.","You might have a hard time.  Regardless of your marital status at the time of signing you could still be what is called tenants in common.  Any two people can be tenants in common.  Go back to your original contract and read what it says.  If it names both of you and both of you agreed then you are probably tenants in common.  Each having half undivided interest.\n\nBut this also means she would be responsible for half  of anything like taxes, mortgage payments and any other expenses with the property.\n\nAbout the only claim you can make to the property would be adverse possesion in he half interest but it might be a stretch.\n\nBut after 25 years of no payment of duties it might equal her half interest anyway.\n\nI would ask for accounting and partition....but see a lawyer."

"4","how do you simplify fractions?","","You are trying to get the smallest number on top (numerator) and bottom (denominator). You divide the numerator and denominator by the same number.\n\nFor example, 180/240 can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 10 to get 18/24. Next you can divide the numerator and denominator by 6. 18 divided by 6 is 3, and 24 divided by 6 is 4 to get a simplified fraction of 3/4. \n\nThe trick is knowing which numbers divide the numerator and denominator evenly."

"3","why do people with relatively low cholesterol get blocked arteries and have heart attacks?","","A lot depends on the ""type"" of cholesterol a person has. The types are LDL and HDL. It's easy to discern the two because you can think of LDL as being the ""lethal"" type.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from an article on WebMD that provides better clarification about the types of cholesterol and why having low cholesterol may lead to heart attacks:\n\n\nCholesterol is transported in a person's blood in special proteins called lipoproteins. The two we are most familiar with are low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol). LDL is often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol. It transports cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues -- depositing excess cholesterol on the walls of arteries to form artery-clogging ""plaques"" that contribute to the development of heart disease and stroke. You want to have less of this. \n\nIn contrast, HDL, or good cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the blood -- transporting it back to the liver, where it can be eliminated from the body. You want to have more of this type. \n\nFurthermore, the latest recommendations are that LDL levels ideally be below 100 -- a significant reduction from previous recommendations -- and that HDL levels be above 40, ideally over 60."

Guys who fall in love with a shallow, vacuous girl are likely (but not always) shallow and vacuous themselves.  However, if you don't like the guys that approach you, that points to a different issue.  You should think about what image you may be projecting.  The guys you are attracting are basing whether or not they'll approach you generally on first impressions, so you may be making a first impression that's not in tune with who you really are.  It's a mistake to dress like the girl who's with the guy that you like, because he may like that girl for a myriad of other reasons besides her appearance.  For instance, how do you know that's not his sister or ex-girlfriend?  Talking to him would answer questions like these.  This illustrates why conversation, interaction, and  getting to know people is the best advice for forming lasting relationships."

But here's what you can do, put the picture on internet at some website, for example your own forum. Take its webaddress and put some html code in your signature, which shows the image(It the same notmal HTML code that you use to show a picture inside a normal webpage). For example, showing you an example with text, if you write :\n\n<b>ABC</b>, the letters ABC will be in bold in your signature. Hope you can write the code for including the image. But I am not sure whether it will work for sure, because their support for signatures is not that great, and many a times, can cause an error."

How does this movie originally end?","""In the theatrical release, he uses a home movie to go back to the party where he first met the little girl. He tells her he hates her and never wants to see her ever again, and that if she tries, he will kill her and her family; naturally prompting her to want to leave with her mother who is getting a divorce. She and her brother do not stay with their father, thereby avoiding everything that had happened in their lives to that point. \n\nHe grows up with his other childhood friend; they go on to college, and he winds up becoming a respectable psychotherapist 8 - 10 years later. At the closing scene, he and the girl pass on the street, each considers looking back, as if recognizing the other (obviously Ashton recognizes her), but neither actually decides to turn around and talk to the other person... they go on with their bittersweet lives without each other."""

He has a better understanding of what life is like for the people, however, he also sees the hatred THEY have for Americans! Is hard to help people when they are trying to kill you!  He(and his family) feel sorry for the people who have to live in such horrible conditions.  His concern is this....How do you tell the good from the bad? How do you know who to help and who is a terrorist that wants nothing more than to kill you? Its a tuff question, and I think it depends on who you ask.  The general American public, that has no education about the situations in the Middle East most likely generalize and hate that race...HOWEVER, for those of us who do have some sort of inside knowledge(military), we are a little more understanding.  We feel sorry and want to help, yet at the same time, dont know who to trust.  I hope this in understandable.\nNow...do I or my husband agree to the USA being there? No Not at all, we dont want to be there! However, we must do what the chain of command says, or we go to prisson and can be put to death! When most of these soldiers joined the Military, there was no war anyplace, so we didnt ask for this, we may not agree with it, but we are bound by a legal contract to do what Bush tells us.  Now, MY husbamd is a medic...his job is to save lives...ALL LIVES.  I dont know if the US Military has or has not raped the people there...I can only speak for MY UNIT....and MY UNIT has never considered anything like that, and I cant believe other units would either. Im not saying its not true, im saying its hard to believe.  War is a horrible thing and horrible things happen in wars.  We dont blame the people in Iraq for hating us...as said, we invaded their land, and they are being lied too and threatened by the terorists.  If I was in that situation I would probably act the same way, but untill the people in Iraq learn to defend themselves from horrible people like Sadam and Osoma..then they will always be in horrible living conditions."

"2","How do a fish's gills extract oxygen?","","The circulation of blood in fish is simple. The heart only has two chambers, in contrast to our heart, which has four. This is because the fish heart only pumps blood in one direction. The blood enters the heart through a vein and exits through an artery on its way to the gills. In the gills, the blood picks up oxygen from the surrounding water and leaves the gills in arteries, which go to the body. The oxygen is used in the body and goes back to the heart. This is a very simple closed-circle circulatory system."

"2","Is Math really invented?","About 2 weeks ago, I asked the same question, and people seemed to be telling me that Math was invented and it does not exist in nature.\n\nI completely disagree with this. ""a + b = b + a"" may not be what Universe be calling this law, but anywhere you go in the universe, this law can still be applied. We have our own language for Math, but that does not mean WE created Math. Let's say, for the sake of argument, evolution was really true, and cats existed many years before humans. They were not called cats, and as soon as English language was being used, the animals we recognize for their fur and meow are called ""Cats"" by us. Now does that mean we invented cats? You may disagree with me, but I would really like to see why.\n\nAlso, for those of you not aware of Phi, it is a mathematical constant, and appears to be everywhere in nature.","There are many things in nature that we come up with symbols to describe.  We invented the symbols to describe it; however, we did not invent the natural phenomenon.\n\nFor example circles are all over the place in nature.  If you divide the circumference of a circle by it's diameter the result is pi.  We invented the term ""Pi"" to describe this; however, we did not invent the natural phenomenon."

"4","What are the amendments? (Bill of Rights)?","","The amendments are the alterations that are made to the constitution. This ability to change was written into the original constitution, and is considered one of the primary reasons that the constitution is such a great document.\n\nThe Bill of Rights refers to the document of 12 amendments (though two were not accepted leaving only ten that have any force of law) to the constitution that had to be made before the constitution was accepted. Primarily they are points that were left out of the original constitution that the delegates felt should be included. So the 10 Amendments of the Bill of Rights were enacted before the constitution was ratified."

You can also make it so that you can use ""1"" and ""2"" to mean things like male and female and have the words show up in the data list instead. Then, once you have it all set up, you simply need to enter the data you have collected into the right spot in the spreadsheet."

Once the screws are out slide the drive out toward the front of the case and once its clear you are done. \n On Laptop models ther are a variety of mounting methods, most models use a slide latch on the bottom of the case, with power off simply slide the latch whichever way is indicated for release (usually to the left) and slide the drive free of the case."

Even if the blind person is violating a pedestrian law, each motorist has a responsibility to stop that is absolute.\n\nHere more detail:\n\nWisconsin has the White Cane Traffic Law, 346.26, which has been in force since 1947. This law states:\n\nBlind pedestrian on highway.\n\n1) An operator of a vehicle shall stop the vehicle before approaching closer than 10 feet to a pedestrian who is carrying a cane or walking stick which is white in color or white trimmed with red and which is held in an extended or raised position or who is using a dog guide and shall take such precautions as may be necessary to avoid accident or injury to the pedestrian. The fact that the pedestrian may be violating any of the laws applicable to pedestrians does not relieve the operator of a vehicle from the duties imposed by this subsection.\n\n2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive any totally or partially blind person not carrying the white or the red and white cane or walking stick or not using a dog guide of the rights of other pedestrians crossing highways, nor shall the failure of such totally or partially blind pedestrian to carry such cane or walking stick or to use a dog guide be evidence of any negligence.\n\n3) No person who is not totally or partially blind shall carry or use on any street, highway or other public place any cane or walking stick which is white in color, or white trimmed with red."

If you compress it, but allow the hest caused by compressing to leave, then you'll get nothing.  It is possible if you have an insulated system to compress it in such a way that temperature of the water rises, but at higher pressures, the temperature needed to boil water increases.  If the water, once heated by comprsession, were to be rapidy brought to a lower pressure through a throttling valve, it could be vaporized.\n\nBut really, if you want water to boil, you should *DECREASE* the pressure.  In out space, water at room temperature would instantly boil due to the low pressure involved."

"2","What is Chaos Theory? Explain in your own words?","Your own words only! I can search google if i want to.

The name ""chaos theory"" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data. \nWhen was chaos first discovered? The first true experimenter in chaos was a meteorologist, named Edward Lorenz. In 1960, he was working on the problem of weather prediction. He had a computer set up, with a set of twelve equations to model the weather. It didn't predict the weather itself. However this computer program did theoretically predict what the weather might be. \n\nOne day in 1961, he wanted to see a particular sequence again. To save time, he started in the middle of the sequence, instead of the beginning. He entered the number off his printout and left to let it run. \n\nWhen he came back an hour later, the sequence had evolved differently. Instead of the same pattern as before, it diverged from the pattern, ending up wildly different from the original. (See figure 1.) Eventually he figured out what happened. The computer stored the numbers to six decimal places in its memory. To save paper, he only had it print out three decimal places. In the original sequence, the number was .506127, and he had only typed the first three digits, .506.   ...(c this site)"

"1","Where does the phrase ""The Whole 9 Yards come from"">?","","I answered this question a few days back with this information:\n\n This phrase is of unknown origin and is the subject of some debate. At issue is to what does nine yards refer. The meaning is clearly the entirety or everything, but nine yards is not a significant measure of anything. All we know about its origin is that the phrase cannot be traced any earlier than the mid-1960s and that it is American in origin.\n\nPerhaps the most common assumption is that it is from American football, but the canonical distance in that game is ten, not nine, yards. Also common are explanations based on length of cloth, but there is no standard length for a bolt of cloth (which measure anywhere from twenty to twenty-five yards), and nine yards is not a significant measure for any type of garment (a man's suit uses about seven yards of a thirty-inch bolt, double folded; sarongs, saris, kilts, kimonos, bridal veils and any number of other garments have been suggested, none with any accompanying evidence).\n\nThe explanation that is currently circulating around the internet most frequently is that nine yards was the length of a belt of machine gun ammunition carried by a WWII fighter plane. To ""give it the whole nine yards"" was to expend all of one's ammo. This explanation is almost certainly false. For one thing, the type of fighter varies with the teller, sometimes Spitfires in the Battle of Britain, sometimes varying American fighters in the South Pacific. Another reason to doubt it is that ammunition is either counted in rounds or by weight. It is never measured in length of a belt. Chapman points to an origin in the Army and Air Force, which fits in with the post-WWII-era origin, but is otherwise unexplained."

After attending several seminars and spending time with Autistic families I've come to believe there are definately genetic issues.  I do believe in some cases the gene is dormant until exposed to a enviromental factor.

But again, I agree with the above answers..  we are far more educated about autism so it may be a case of more accurated dx's are being made...  ie, rather than dx's a child with  retardation, the persons behaviors  observed more closely and dx'd as autistim...."

However, when she did not return his love, he placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions. Thus Cassandra foresees the destruction of Troy (she warns the Trojans about the Trojan Horse, the death of Agamemnon, and her own demise), but is unable to do anything about them. Coroebus and Othronus came to the aid of Troy out of love for Cassandra.After the Trojan War, Cassandra is taken as a concubine and slave girl by King Agamemnon of Mycenae after being raped by Ajax. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus. Upon Agamemnon and Cassandra's arrival in Mycenae, Clytemnestra asked her husband to walk across a purple carpet; he initially refused then gave in and entered, not believing Cassandra's warnings. Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered Agamemnon, and then Cassandra. Some information says that Cassandra and Agamemnon have twin boys Teledamus and Pelops, who are killed by Aegisthus."

"5","Should I buy an AMD 3700+ or wait till the price of dual core processors goes down?","","The question is do you want to plan for the future now by getting a dual core processor.  Currently not many applications support dual core processors (save for Windows and some versions of Linux) so they would only be utilizing one core, games and Office, for example.  By late next year there should be plenty of applications that can use dual core processors and the prices will likely drop as well.  For now, I think you are fine with the AMD 3700+.  Next year, if you wanted you could most likely pop a dual core chip into your motherboard, just make sure the BIOS supports it.  If you want to check out a dual core system, this one is one of my favorites http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/HP-Pavilion-Desktop-PC-A1250N-/sem/rpsm/oid/134690/catOid/-12962/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do for the price it's an excellent value, that is, if you are looking at a whole system and not just a processor upgrade."

"2","What is the difference between sleet and hail?","","Sleet is formed by snow (single ice crystals) being formed in cold clouds and then falling through warmer air so that they begin to partially melt, falling as wet snow - sleet.\n\nHailstones form by water droplets freezing very quickly in a cloud so that they form a small blob or nucleus rather than the larger crystal formed by a slow freezing snow flake crystal. The nucleus continues to fall through the cloud until it meets a strong upcurrent of warmer damper air coming up from the ground.  This blows the ice droplet up into the colder part of the cloud.  the warm air surrounding the nucleus cools and the water in it condenses out and freezes onto the surface of the existing ice droplet making it larger and heavier.  This is cycle isrepeated until the updraught is not strong enough to keep the hailstone airborne and it (and the millions of others with it) drop to the ground.\n\nThe stronger the updraught the larger the final hailstone.\n\nIf you collect some hailstones after they have dropped and use a sharp knife to cleanly cut one in half, you might be able to see the individuals layers of ice within the hailstone through a magnifying glass or microscope.\n\nHailstones can become very very big - have alook at the guiness book of records - but I believe that you Americans hold the record for a hailstone that fell in Kansas, USA, and was measured at 43.18cm (17 in) long - unfortunately no idea of the weight."

"6","Will the Indian Cricket Team Win the 2007 World Cup in West Indies ?","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket","Hmmm..... It's a tricky one. So, here is a tricky answer from my side.\n\nOn their current form India looks capable of winning the WC 2007, Infactany team can win it. If we look at the ICC ODI Ranking Table then we would see that Australia is 1st and way ahead. But competition is strict from 2nd to 7th as South Africa is marginally ahead of Pakistan who is followed by India, England, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand. This shows how close these teams are when it comes to their standard of play and their consistency. It also means that from 2nd to 7th Position any team can beat its opponent (Even Australia, As New Zealand has just proved it by beating Australia in a record chase). So I think any of the Top Seven teams can won the World Cup on its day. Now a days ODI cricket has become so unpredictable that any thing can happen. \n\nComing back to the question, I would say that Aussies are favorites to defend their title but a bad day can stop their march towards a dream hat trick. Apart from Australia, every other team (i.e.; England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa) have equal chance to win the WC 2007. Any of the above mentioned team can make Aussies pay for their mistakes on the certain day. So, I would say that, India has equal chance of winning the World Cup 2007 as any other Top 7 team, with Aussies being the Favorites."

"1","why is 13 considered unlucky?","","Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13, a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture. While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times, the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage, having been first coined by Coriat (1911; Simpson and Weiner 1992). It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8, 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee. \n\nThis superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13. In particular, this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1, 2, ..., 11, 12, 14, 15, ... (Sloane's A011760; the ""elevator sequence""), omitting the number 13, in many high-rise American hotels, the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue, and so on. \n\nApparently, 13 hasn't always been considered unlucky. In fact, it appears that in ancient times, 13 was either considered in a positive light or (more commonly) not at all (Adams). The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus, although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times. \n\nThe association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars (such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles, while the solar Gregorian calendar  in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year. \n\nTriskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology, which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla, only to have his party crashed by Loki, the god of evil and turmoil, thus giving a total of 13 people. The legend goes on to related how Balder, one of the most beloved gods, tired to throw Loki out of the party, resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. \n\nFear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth  (a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia), despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century (""and on a Friday fell all this misfortune""), but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). In particular, it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture (beginning a journey, giving birth, getting married, moving, starting a new job, etc.) beginning around 1800 (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). \n\nWhile 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper, the Crucifixion took place on a Friday, thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day. Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, on Friday, October 13, 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention (Mikkelson and Mikkelson). \n\nParaskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States, possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans. Interestingly, a study by Scanlon et al. (1993) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health, behavior, and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that, ""The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52%. Staying at home is recommended."" \n\nWhile there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim, it has been suggested that $800 to $900 millio"

"7","The combination of histones and DNA forms a nuceoprotein called _______?","","Nucleosome\n\n\nA nucleosome is the fundamental repeating subunit of eukaryotic DNA, and is made up of DNA and histone proteins. It is found in the cell nucleus in eukaryotes. All chromatin (except for that packaged in the sperm nucleus) consists of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes can be seen with an electron microscope as bead-like structures along the DNA.\n\n[edit]\nStructure\n \nThe crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.The histones make up the central core particle of the nucleosome. The DNA is wrapped around this protein complex in 1.6 turns, comprising about 145 base pairs. Together with the DNA linking two nucleosomes, there are about 200 bps of DNA per nucleosome.\n\nNucleosomes are involved in processes ranging from compaction of DNA to transcriptional control, and appear to be major carriers of epigenetically inherited information as well. Repeating nucleosomes with intervening ""linker"" DNA form the 10-nm-fiber, known descriptively as ""beads on a string"", and have a packing ratio of ~6, compared to ""free"" DNA (per nm length). A chain of nucleosomes can be arranged in a 30-nm-fiber, a compacted structure (thought to be a helical solenoid, a zigzag ribbon structure, a superbead, or having no regular structure) with a packing ratio of ~40. The H1 histone stabilizes this structure. Beyond 30 nm fiber the structure of chromatin is poorly understood, but it is classically suggested that the 30 nm fiber is arranged into loops along a central protein scaffold to form transcriptionally active euchromatin. Further compaction leads to transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin."
"7","With one year left on my lease for my retail store, when should I begin to re-negotiate for a new one?","I have a retail store with one year left on my lease. I am wondering when would be a good time to start talks with the landlord. Should I wait for another 3 months or perhaps 6 months? Or should I let it be known I want to extend it now?","I would start to plant the seed with the landlord soon. You will be in a better position to negotiate with him if you have more time and thought invested. Start by dropping hints and let him know what you like and dislike about where you are. Also check out what similar areas in other retail locations are renting for. Not for the sake of moving, but to use in your negotiation process if needed.\n\nNegotiating is like dating. Not many people say yes to a marrige proposal on the first date. You have to court that person for some time before popping the big question."

I contacted Sprint's Fraud Management, filled out the paperwork as instructed and mailed them in. Its been three months and I have not heard anything from that department. I have not been able to contact them to find out the status of my complaint. My question is: ""How can I deal with this problem and get that false charged off my credit report?""","I recommend checking your credit report to see if Sprint has placed this account on there.  The only company that gives free credit reports offered by the government is annualcreditreport.com.  If the Sprint account is on there but you never opened any account with them you might be the victim of identity theft.  Your first step is to place a fraud victim security alert on your credit report which lasts approximentally 3 months to a year depending on the credit bureau.  Your next step is to go to your local police department and file an identity theft report.  Once you have a copy of your police report send it in along with a letter disputing the account as not belonging to you to the credit bureau.  They will send a copy of your police report to Sprint for you and block the account from appearing on your credit report."

"7","How much does my former employer pay for unemployment benefits in California?  Does it come out of her pocket?","","The previous poster is incorrect.  In fact, the unemployment benefits program is paid for by a tax paid by employers, not employees.  The tax is applied to the first $7000 of wages paid to each employee.  The exact percentage of tax the employer pays varies; it depends on how many previous unemployment claims that employer had (the fewer claims, the lower the tax on the employer)"
"2","How do you prove the existence of God using acceptable scientific methods?","","Science is by nature empirical, if you can't observe or quantify something then it cannot be studied scientifically. For this reason, God cannot be proven scientifically (and technically, science can't disprove God, as you can never prove a negative), as you can't observe Him.\n\nThis is not to say that science and God are mutually exclusive. If God exists, and if His actions were observable then it would be studied scientifically."
"10","evolution vs creation- if we can be taught about Darwin's idea of life in school, why not Moses'?","","You can be taught about Moses's idea of life in school. I was, in my Comparitive Religions class, my World History class and my general Social Studies class. They don't teach Moses's beliefs on the origins of life in Biology class because his beliefs aren't scientific in nature. Moses didn't ask the Hebrews to believe him because of scientific proofs, but because of their faith in G-D."

Should I really trust the company who stands to gain more profit  from me getting higher bills (even though I lean towards their rationale)?","You are better off turning it down at night. You can get a programmable thermostat so you don't have to do it manually. You can get a 7 day programmable (recommended if you will be changing the temp every day) or a 5/2 (changes it only on weekends). I'd recommend a White-Rodgers 1F80-361"

"5","What is a blog?","I have head this word a lot of times but did not understand it. what does it mean?","A blog is a website for which an individual or a group frequently generates text, photographs, video or audio files, and/or links, typically (but not always) on a daily basis. The term is a shortened form of weblog. Authoring a blog, maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called ""blogging"". Individual articles on a blog are called ""blog posts,"" ""posts,"" or ""entries"". The person who posts these entries is called a ""blogger"".\n\n    * Electronic communities existed before internetworking. For example the AP wire was, in effect, similar to a large chat room with ""wire fights"" and electronic conversations. Another pre-digital electronic community, amateur (or ""ham"") radio, allowed individuals who set up their own broadcast equipment to communicate with others directly. Ham radio also had logs called ""glogs"" that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s.\n    * Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, e-mail lists and bulletin boards. In the 1990s Internet forum software, such as WebX, created running conversations with ""threads."" Threads are topical connections between messages on a electronic ""corkboard."" See ""Common terms,"" below.\n    * Diarists kept journals on the Web: most called themselves online diarists, journalists, journallers, or journalers. A few called themselves escribitionists. The Open Pages webring contained members of the online-journal community. The first famous journaller was probably Justin Hall.\n    * Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer John Carmack's widely read journal, published via the finger protocol.\n    * Websites, including both corporate sites and personal homepages, had and still often have ""What's New"" or ""News"" sections, often on the index page and sorted by date."

"3","Why do we get dandruff?","","Some dandruff is caused by dry scalp. Some is caused by a skin condition called seborrheic dermatitis. It is now commonly believed that this may be a fungus infection. \n\nSo, dandruff shampoos are ""medicated"" (such as Neutrogena T/Gel or Nizoral) to make conditions such that the fungus can't thrive. Home remedies do the same thing (Listerine has herbal medications, use of dilute vinegar increases the pH of the scalp)."

"5","What are key difference between Movable Type and Wordpress blogging platforms? Which should I choose?","","For one, Movable Type is written in perl, Wordpress in PHP. Setup for Wordpress is generally easier. Movable Type is more complicated and can host multiple blogs. Movable Type can currently only handle one per installation though that should change soon. Moveable Type is not free if you have more than one blog. WordPress is completely free. MT requires at least some pregeneration of static pages. Wordpress generates all pages out of a database. Since MT has been around longer, it's more mature and has lots of plugins for it. Wordpress is catching up though. Personally I prefer Wordpress because it's simpler and easier to make changes to."

Next, when you want to extract the content from the data base, it's piece of cake because if you want to show it, it's already formated and you will see as the original. \nIf you want to put it in the textarea just write in the HTML source file the following:\n<textarea ...><% // echo the extracted content here %></textarea>\n\nI hope this will help you."

"7","What kind of process was used to change Michael Jackson's skin color? How much did it costs?","Is this procedure available to general public? Are there any side affects or dangers on future health?","No. It is not available to general public. He had to submit to this procedure due to the skin desease he has called Vitiligo. \n\nThis illness destroys the skin pigmentation in some areas of the body... causing that in a black person skin (like Michael) appear big white patches.\nThe process Michael had was to destroy the pigmentation of the rest of the still coloured skin when the illness was too advanced and he could not put make up on the white patches like he did in the beginning (Late 70s, early 80s)\n\nAlthough I think it is not too dangerous, since its a common procedure to treat patients with advanced Vitiligo it has side effects. This process destroys the pigmentation of the skin, that is the natural protection from the sun, so you have to be very careful with your skin. Especially you cannot be exposed to the sun. That's the reason Michael wears dark clothes, mask, fedora and umbrella most of the times he goes out.\nAnd probably you will have to put some creams for the skin, sun blocker or even take special medicine. \n\nThough I'm not so sure of how much this may cost... I bet it's a lot."

"7","why does the Bible begin with Adam and Eve but yet makes no mention of dinoseours or cave men.?","","The Bible is a record of a specific group of people and their beliefs.  It does not mention the Chinese, but we do know that they existed at the same time as the ancient Hebrews.  If we look at the creation story in the eyes of the people that recorded it, we will find that in different sources, there are different, shall we say, interpretations of the story.  We know, because Christ said such, that he taught only in parables.  As the Son of God, we must accept that, as deity, he would not change.  He clearly states that he was the God of the Old Testament. Since he is unchangable, he must have taught by parable.  Until one accepts that much of the Old Testament contains many accounts that are symbolic in their meaning, such as the Book of Job, we must either see them as irrational explanations of the world (myths)or fairy tales.  Since many of us reject these explanations, we must decide that there is a rational reason for the way the things are told.  When we see the symbolic, hidden meanings within the story, then understanding and personal revelation, through prayer and deep contemplation can reach us.\nWhen we look at the story of Genesis, we are not looking at a detailed description of the entire act of creation, merely a summary as explained to Moses.  However, the chronology of the events do, in fact, reflect the modern scientific explanation in a simple and to an ancient inhabitant, understandable manner of the creation of the earth.\nThere are millions of animals, plants, and other things that are not mentioned in Genesis, but that does not mean that they did not exist.  But it does show that the planet had to be created before life could be.  Plant life proceeds animal life , which proceeds human existence.  In this, there is no disagreement with science.\nAnother thing we must accept, when we carefully study the Bible is that much of it has been altered, lost or mistranslated.  this can lead to serious misunderstandings."

He is currently, alledgedly, a pro baseball scout.  There is no record of him having ever played for the Phillies according to their media guide, I can find no major league stats for him anywhere and I have not located a baseball card for him.  He is dating my sister and claims he played in the majors for 7 years, mostly with the Giants.  I think he is a fraud, but perhaps he at least spent some time in the minors or, though unlikely, maybe I just haven't looked in the right places.  Anyone who can provide me some answers would do me a great service and might just prevent a relationship disaster from happening.","Baseball_Reference.com lists every major league player that has appeared in a game, and does not list Greenhalgh. (It essentially replaced the old Baseball Encyclopedia.)\n\nIf his claim is that he was a professional player, that is certainly possible, since minor league players are professionals, and you know he was drafted.   He may also have been a coach or instructor of some kind.  There are no good complete sources listing minor league players or coaches, or even scouts.

"4","Why and when was the Mason-Dixon line completed?","","Though the Mason-Dixon line is most commonly associated with the division between the northern and southern (free and slave, respectively) states during the 1800s and American Civil War-era, the line was delineated in the mid-1700s to settle a property dispute. The two surveyors who mapped the line, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, will always be known for their famous boundary.\n\nIn 1632, King Charles I of England gave the first Lord Baltimore, George Calvert, the colony of Maryland. Fifty years later, in 1682, King Charles II gave William Penn the territory to the north, which later became Pennsylvania. A year later, Charles II gave Penn land on the Delmarva Peninsula (the peninsula that includes the eastern portion of modern Maryland and all of Delaware).\n\nThe description of the boundaries in the grants to Calvert and Penn did not match and there was a great deal of confusion as to where the boundary (supposedly along 40° north) lay. The Calvert and Penn families took the matter to the British court and England's chief justice declared in 1750 that the boundary between southern Pennsylvania and northern Maryland should lie 15 miles south of Philadelphia. A decade later, the two families agreed on the compromise and set out to have the new boundary surveyed. Unfortunately, colonial surveyors were no match for the difficult job and two experts from England had to be recruited.\n\n\n\nCharles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon arrived in Philadelphia in November 1763. Mason was an astronomer who had worked at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and Dixon was a renowned surveyor. The two had worked together as a team prior to their assignment to the colonies.\n\nAfter arriving in Philadelphia, their first task was to determine the exact absolute location of Philadelphia. From there, they began to survey the north-south line that divided the Delmarva Peninsula into the Calvert and Penn properties. Only after the Delmarva portion of the line had been completed did the duo move to mark the east-west running line between Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n\nThey precisely established the point fifteen miles south of Philadelphia and since the beginning of their line was west of Philadelphia, they had to begin their measurement to the east of the beginning of their line. They erected a limestone benchmark at their point of origin.\n\nTravel and surveying in the rugged ""west"" was difficult and slow going. The surveyors had to deal with many different hazards, one of the most dangerous to the men being the indigenous Native Americans living in the region. The duo did have Native American guides although once the survey team reached a point 36 miles east of the end point of the boundary, their guides told them not to travel any farther. Hostile residents kept the survey from reaching its end goal. Thus, on October 9, 1767, almost four years after they began their surveying, the 233 mile-long Mason-Dixon had (almost) been completely surveyed.\n\nOver fifty years later, the boundary between the two states came into the spotlight with the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Compromise established a boundary between the slave states of the south and the free states of the north (however its separation of Maryland and Delaware is a bit confusing since Delaware was a slave state that stayed in the Union). This boundary became referred to as the Mason-Dixon line because it began in the east along the Mason-Dixon line and headed westward to the Ohio River and along the Ohio to its mouth at the Mississippi River and then west along 36° 30' North.\n\nThis line was very symbolic in the minds of the people of the young nation struggling over slavery and the names of the two surveyors who created it will evermore be associated with that struggle and its geographic association"

"1","Taoists?  What is Taoism to you?","","Taoism-The philosophical system stems largely from the Tao-te-ching, a text traditionally ascribed to Lao Tzu but probably written in the mid-3d cent. B.C. The Tao, in the broadest sense, is the way the universe functions, the path [Chin. tao=path] taken by natural events. It is characterized by spontaneous creativity and by regular alternations of phenomena (such as day following night) that proceed without effort. Effortless action may be illustrated by the conduct of water, which unresistingly accepts the lowest level and yet wears away the hardest substance. Human beings, following the Tao, must abjure all striving. The ideal state of being, fully attainable only by mystical contemplation, is simplicity and freedom from desire, comparable to that of an infant or an “uncarved block.”\n\nTaoist political doctrines reflect this quietistic philosophy: the ruler's duty is to impose a minimum of government, while protecting his people from experiencing material wants or strong passions. The social virtues expounded by Confucius were condemned as symptoms of excessive government and disregard of effortless action. Second only to Lao Tzu as an exponent of philosophical Taoism was Chuang-tzu, who wrote brilliant satirical essays. Taoist ideals greatly influenced Chinese literature, painting, and calligraphy. Later Taoism emphasized the techniques [Chin. te=power] for realizing the effects flowing from the Tao, especially long life and physical immortality."

"1","Why, as Christians, we do not celebrate Hanukkah? This is a celebration that dates back before Christ.?","Christ was a Jew and if we follow the teachings that happened in the Old Testament, then why do we not celebrate that, too?","A very sensitive question to be sure. Hanukkah means re-dedication and it is a time when present-day Jews re-dedicate their faith. As many people know it is certainly not as important of a holiday as Passover, Yom Kippur, Shavuot, and other Jewish holidays. Most of the over-importance heaped on Hanukkah is due to its timing when comparing the Hebrew calendar to the Roman calendar. I personally find it ironic that the 25th of Kislev (the Hebrew calendar date for the first night of Hanukkah) is associated with the 25th of December (the Roman calendar date for the observance of Christmas). \n\nSo on to your specific question. There is no good answer why Christians do not celebrate Hanukkah. In the spirit of global tolerance and of coming together Christians may want to light a menorah to usher in the holiday time. After all there are an increasing number of Christians that celebrate the Passover holiday; even if it is likened to Christ's Last Supper which was undoubtably a Seder. \n\nOne of the most poignant discussions on the significance and relevance of Hanukkah to Christians is from Reverend Ricky Hoyt. I have included it as source. \n\nHappy holidays!!"

TNG really hit its stride starting in its third season and had some absolutely magnificent episodes in seasons 4 and 5 (such as ""In Theory,"" ""Darmok,"" ""Cause and Effect,"" and ""The Inner Light,"" just to name a few).  DS9 was darker and more spiritual, exploring the Bajoran civilization as well as the Gamma Quadrant with subtlety and grace.  It also had some great individual episodes, especially ""Far Beyond the Stars.""  In my opinion, TNG at its best was better than DS9 at its best, but over the course of its entire seven seasons DS9 was better than TNG over the course of its entire seven seasons.  So I guess I'd have to call it a tie between TNG and DS9."

"2","how does gas cutter work?","","If you mean plasma cutter, I can help.  A plasma cutter puts a high-frequency (RF) pulse from the copper tool tip to the metallic material to be cut.  This ionizes the air.  Then DC power is delivered to the arc.  The machine dumps a lot of power into the material, heating it up.  The small opening in the tip is for air which blows the molten material away.  In the case of aluminum, the air just pushes it out of the way.  In the case of steel, the air charge reacts with the iron to produce iron oxide, which further produces more heat than just the arc and helps cut the material.\n\nTraditional gas cutting with acetylene and Oxygen is similar, although i have never gas-cut aluminimum.  (?)  The oxy-acetylene is set up to heat the steel with a blue flame.  When a spot is melted through, you push the oxygen lever which lets a lot of oxygen out right onto the metal.  The ferrous (iron) material burns with the oxygen, cutting the steel."

Peter still has some doubts about the safety of the two of them engaging into a relationship and meets and befriends (in a way, his ""new"" best friend) astronaut Edward Brock (Topher Grace) who is the quite the comedian, often upsetting M.J. \n\nMeanwhile, M.J works to reconcile Peter's relationship with Harry Osborne who does not yet reveal that he's found out the secret about his father. Harry takes on more heavier drinking while putting on a false reconciliation with Peter by throwing a party for the both of them, there he meets Topher, I mean Eddie. Eddie says at one point in the film, ""I know I'm not a day older than you Peter... but I'm beginning to feel the astronaut life is weighing far too much for me. I'm thinking about retiring and maybe then you could find me a job as a reporter for the Daily Bugle"" which Peter happily looks forward to. Harry takes notice of the bond established between Eddie and Peter and begins feeling jealous - at the same time his schizophrenia about his father returning starts getting a stronger hold on him on a par with his alcoholism. \n\nEdward goes to M.J's apartment to look for Peter (whose off saving people from Sandman - whose not yet Sandman, just a common criminal by the name of Flint Marko) and M.J covers up for Peter. Eddie decides to leave his gift to Peter for saving him the other day (in a scene where Peter Parker (not Spider-man) saves him from a few Muggers. This scene is highly significant because after Peter saves Eddie, Ed comments on how not all of us have the innocence of comedy in ourselves - but to believe in that innocence, is a dream of mine) M.J asks Edward why can't he give it to Peter himself and Ed says he's got this huge expedition in space - his final ""lift off"" and he'll stay grounded for ever. \n\nThe gift happens to be an access pass to the Space station that corresponds to the transmission between NASA and the spacecrafts in orbit - this way Pete can contact Edward. Meanwhile, Flint Marko - takes on his pedestrian counter-part as William Baker - who works to scam Oscorp. Pete gives Harry some helpful intellectual strategies on how to counter Baker's plot to ruin him - Harry thanks him and they have a small sentimental talk as friends about why he killed his father. \n\nHarry asks Peter if he knew all along, and Peter says he didn't - not till the end. Peter then tries to reconcile any past issues between Harry and his father but Harry says the real Norman Osborne died regretting Peter Parker wasn't his son. Harry quickly apologizes for saying that by using his typsy-ness as an excuse. Peter understands Harry envys the life Peter's living, but Peter tells he would rather live a life without so many risks. Harry reassures he's always got him. Meanwhile, William Baker breaks into Harry's office later and finds the Goblin lair - he is directed by the Green Goblin in the form of Norman Osborne - Harry wasn't schizophrenic after all - to put some of the Performance Enhancing Syrum into Harry's alcoholic beverages - in return, Baker gets the location of a place where he can rob himself to riches. Peter and M.J go to the Space Station and they talk to Eddie from space. \n\nThis is the last friendly conversation Peter and Eddie ever engage in as they cheer off their happy anniversary until something goes horribly wrong - a substance they've gathered from one of the moon rocks has caused a combustion in the shuttle engine.

They rightly point out that sexuality is only a small part of someone's entire life and personality, so it's poor manners to make too big a deal of it.\n\nThat said, homosexuals still have to deal with harassment, which becomes more of an issue in rural areas.  Also many families are not comfortable with their sons and daughters being gay which can also cause strain."

Physical reasons might be that the part of your body may be too tight to allow for good circulation.  In this case, you must stretch (eg. yoga or pilates) and exercise to loosen up that area.  Doing heat pack will also help to aid the blood flow temporarily.  One important thing to remember though is that the source of tightness might be completely unexpected.  If you have cold hands, it may be more helpful to stretch your calves or your shoulders depending on your body structure rather than the hand itself.  You must remember to treat your body as a whole.  Chemical reasons could come from your diet or the air you breathe or any other intake (eg. tobacco or drugs).  This could alter the chemical make up of your bloodstream.  In this case, what you would have to do is to remove the chemical that is causing the problem.

The only reason that they are not is because there are far fewer 18 to 21 year-olds in the US than there are 21+ year-olds.  Back when the amendment to the constitution was passed setting the voting age to 18 was when there was a forceable draft and when the baby boomers were all between 18 and 21 - they had the power then, and they have it now."

And don't answer with all the PC garbage. Whats the truth here?","i'll tell you what, you want a straight up answer? i'll give you one! all PC crap aside. i have been all over this planet and seen some pretty awesome things and dated some very foreign women. in the end i have learned that there is two things that make this a little more difficult than dating some one of your own class and ethniticity. 1) parents- they make life difficult on every level of this because they are usually stuck in a oneminded track of how things ought to be. usualy because thats how they were brought up. but even thats a poor excuse for their offten tired and outdated principles. most times they just have a cankering of racial bigotry in their heads just like everyone else. they usually make things twice as difficult on their dughter/son as what things already are and in the end the child will usually claim allegiance to them and their wishes. it snot fair and you cant really do much about it. this is usually the biggest reason for ""intermixed"" relationships to fail. 2) each other- you to individuals are in most cases born of two completely different worlds. in each of these worlds there are certain rules and traditions that are generally expected to be followed without question (parents usually play a role in this also). often times you two individuals get these rules and traditions crossed or confused and guess what? problems occur! whats worse, is mosot times you blame eachother for not understanding the other or you tell eachother that the other refuses to listen or learn. the fact is, both times it all depends on the want or need to make it work. it can and often times does work out, but not without a whole lot of headache and elbow grease. you want to take this person on, good, but make damn well sure they want to take you on. there is a such thing as ""slumming it"", and you will find people out there that know they are going to end up with a person of their own race and class but are interested in playing with something a little differernt for a while. more often than not, and dont take this personal, but it is usually the female that gets this idea. guys dont usually particulary care too much about and too tell you the truth, the most bigoted and hard headed people i have ever met were mothers. they can play hell on their children if they dont approve of them spending their lives with some white boy, or this black girl of yours, blah,blah,blah..its hard man, you just got to have a pair and go for it in the end if its what you want. sometimes you cant control the outcome, but you can work to make the outcome better than it would be if you just left it for what it is on ts own. thats the truth in it from how i see things. everybody is different, thats how i look at things too. nothing ever exactly works out too plan. there wil always be a glitch or hitch somewhere, just make it work for you and your other instead of getting stuck on it. if your in that relationship than you should both know that it isnt interracial, its interpersonal. you two, together, or you two falling apart. thats the best i can explain it to you."

Arrogant, pompous words. Except when they are spoken by Edson Arantes do Nascimento, the Brazilian genius known throughout the football world as Pele.\n\nA veteran of four World Cups, scorer of 1,283 first-class goals - 12 of them in World Cup final tournaments - a member of those magical Brazilian squads that won soccer's greatest prize in 1958, 1962 and 1970.\n\nBut just as a collection of notes do not make a Beethoven symphony, statistics cannot capture the majesty of those glorious Brazilian sides. This was football played to a samba beat. Beautiful skills, astonishing speed and ball control - and of all those great players in the yellow and green shirts, Pele was the greatest of them all.\n\nHe was lithe, agile, strong and seemed to be able to make the ball do as he pleased. Blessed with a stunning shot and an ability to soar above defences, he was expected to perform some astonishing feat of trickery every time he was in possession.\n\nAnd Brazil played such adventurous football, always attacking, constantly looking to score. Who can forget the rythmic chanting of their deliriously happy supporters? ""Bra-zil, cha cha cha, Bra-zil, cha cha cha.""\n\nIt was the 1962 World Cup in Chile when those chants were heard for the first time in Europe on TV and British fans were quick to copy. First club names were shouted out, followed by a burst of clapping. Soon the strains of ""ee-ay-addeo"" echoed round Football League grounds.\n\nThree decades on, the chants may be different. But it was the Brazil of Pele which gave them to the world.\n\nPele was born in the poor district of Tres Coracoes in 1940. His father, known as Dondhino, was a footballer too, but an undistinguished one.\n\nPele was in love with football from the time he learned to kick a ball. But his mother was not so keen. Dondhino earned little money from the game and she wanted something better for her son. Had she got her way, football would have been denied one of its greatest talents.\n\nPele's precocious skill came to the attention of de Brito, a former Brazilian international who began to coach him. In 1954, aged 14, he joined Bauru Athletic Club juniors in Sao Paulo. At 16, despite a knee injury which was to trouble him throughout his career, he moved to Santos where he remained until 1974.\n\nTogether, Pele and Santos were to become legends, touring Europe and playing friendly matches. One of the British sides to entertain them was Sheffield Wednesday. As late as 1972, Pele turned out in his club's famous all-white strip to play one half in a goodwill visit to Hillsborough.\n\nIt was the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden which was to create the stage for Pele's genius. He was 17 and had won his first cap the previous year. He arrived in Sweden with an injury and was held back until Brazil's third and final group match against the Soviet Union in Gothenburg.\n\nBrazil won 2-0, Pele hit the post, laid on the second goal for Vava and a star had been born. The quarter-final was against Wales. Brazil only won 1-0. The scorer was Pele, his shot deflecting off Stuart Williams. It was his first World Cup goal - and he was to score six in a sequence of three games by the time the final was over.\n\nA hat-trick against France in the semi-final was followed by two goals against Sweden in the final. One of them, a breathtaking effort, was described by the football authority Brian Glanville in his book, The Story of the World Cup.\n\n""Catching a high ball in the thick of the pen"

It uses a larger dish than the TV and has a microwave transmitter so it needs to be out of reach of people.  Not dangerous but it has the potential to be.  It uses an adapter (modem) that connects to your computer via ethernet cable so you need an ethernet card, and windows 98 or above supports it.  There is no longer any software involved so nothing is done to your computer except maybe get rid of old software from DSL or cable that sometimes won't allow it, and disabling the firewall for  the computer to pick it up.\n\nThere's also a company called ""wild blue"".  They are new but seem to have a very good product.  Roughly the same idea as direcway.\n\nDirecway can be roof mounted, wall mounted only if the dish can be up high enough and facing the satellite in space (there are several), and pole mounted by a professional installer only due to the safety concerns."

"3","Why do women live more than men?","","""Studying people who live 100 years and more leads Harvard researchers to conclude that menopause is a major determinant of the life spans of both women and men.\n\nWomen's life span depends on the balance of two forces, according to Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School. One is the evolutionary drive to pass on her genes, the other is the need to stay healthy enough to rear as many children as possible. ""Menopause draws the line between the two,"" Perls says. It protects older women from the risks of bearing children late in life, and lets them live long enough to take care of their children and grandchildren.""\n\nRead more at the source link."

Timothy Dalton was also a pretty good Bond and he had a resemblance to Pierce Brosnan.\n\nLazenby, now he was probably the worst Bond ever, he was in what, one Bond movie and it's the one I hate most.\n\nBut Sean Connery was in a stinker Bond also, the one where he plays that holographic game called ""Domination"" or something like that, I can't remember the name of it but I think it is one of the worst Bond films ever."

"9","i want know about love deeply?","to know what is love deeply and a good teacher of word of God","Scientific evidence strongly suggests that to maintain emotional and physical health we have to know how to relate to each other in a caring way. The undeniable evidence is that anger, anxiety and depression, on one hand, and love and intimacy on the other, affect health and recovery from illness. This findings have been elaborated by Dean Ornish MD in Love and Survival. The Scientific Basis for the Healing Power of Intimacy. (1997)  He writes: \n\n“…love and intimacy are at the root of what makes us sick and what makes us well... I am not aware of any factor in medicine -- not diet, not smoking, not stress, not genetics, not drugs, not surgery—that has greater  impact on our quality of life, incidence of illness and premature death from all causes.” \n\nYet, caring (love to be blunt,) which is presumed to be based on a mammalian instinct, strongly allied with survival is fraught with difficulties and is becoming increasingly difficult to exercise in our culture. Hoping to counteract these trends, I endeavor to teach people the simple, basic transactions that constitute the loving experience. This practice is based on three concepts: Strokes, The Stroke Economy and Opening the Heart. \n\nPuzzled by the difficulties that people have when exchanging strokes I came upon Wilhelm Reich’s concept of the ""sex economy,"" which he defined as the intentional squelching of sexual exchanges among German youth for the purpose of promoting conformity. I saw a similar inhibiting trend in our culture, applied to simple affection and love, and called it the ""stroke economy.""\n\nThe stroke economy creates a scarcity of love and affection by imposing a set of rules that govern the exchange of strokes. \n\nThe rules of the stroke economy are:\n\nDon’t give strokes you would like to give.\n\nDon’t ask for strokes you would like to get. \n\nDon’t accept strokes you would like to accept.\n\nDon’t reject strokes you don’t want.\n\nDon’t give yourself strokes.\n\nThese rules are enforced internally and externally. Internally, by what we, in transactional analysis, call the inner Critical Parent. The Critical Parent is an ego state and as such it represents a network of ideas, acquired in childhood which deeply affect love of ourselves and others. These ideas can be seen as ingrained neural networks; ""limbic attractors"" that shape every emotional experience according to an archaic blueprint.\n\nWhile loving patterns are set in childhood, later relationships in which the person establishes a limbic resonance with another are capable of restructuring  the original design. Lewis et al conclude that permanent beneficial restructuring of a persons deeply ingrained limbic brain patterns is possible through long-term individual psychotherapy with a therapist who, for all intents and purposes, needs to be a paragon of limbic virtue."

That means the image dipole is in the same orientation as the original dipole and is at a distance r = 2I from it. The force is attractive (towards the plane). The energy between two dipoles having the same moment p parallel to their separation vector is:\n\nW = -2p^2/r^3\n\nwhere r is the separation distance. The force between two such real dipoles would be (i.e. this is the force on either one):\n\nF = dW/dr = -6p^2/r^4\n\nThis should be the same force experienced by the one dipole in the field produced by the conducting plane.

Stop eating at least 3 hours before you get in bed.  A reclining position with food in your stomach irritates the esophogus.  You would be AMAZED at how much this helps.  Soda or alcohol before sleep is the WORST!\n\n3.  Limit intake of:  Alcohol, Caffience, Carbonated beverages, spicy foods, acidic foods, aspirin (or advil, motrin).   Honestly, I can't stick to this one -- but I've been pretty good keeping #1 and #2, and it's kept my heart burn at bay.

"7","Why are there so many religons? and how do you know which one is right?","","The book of Romans in the Christian bible answers this question pretty well. Humans were created with a natural sense that there is a God. But because of their rebellious nature against Him, they are alienated from Him in their hearts, minds, and consciences. So, being spiritually dead, they are blind to the truths about Him. Therefore, their corrupted minds invent false beliefs about Him. How do you know which one is right? It starts in the heart. Like I've said, it is the prideful and rebellious heart of human kind that is the problem. It is not impossible for you to know the truth, in fact it is so easy that it's heartbreaking that most people miss it. The only people who can find the truth are those who sincerly want it. I will give it to you, but I can't make you accept it. Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He came to be put to death for your sins. You can't justify yourself before God because you, like all humans, are imperfect. What you can do(indeed the only thing you can do) is humble yourself before God and confess that you are a sinner worthy of death, but that you now believe that Jesus has taken your place and removed your sins and guilt forever, never to be brought up before God again. Ask the Lord Jesus to enter your heart and make it new. Then trust that you are pardoned by God and be at peace with Him. Do this and you will have your ""evidence"" in your own heart and mind and life."

They were always questioning why we bought items that they thought were unnecessary, etc.\nThe best thing for you is to make a budget.  I know, it sounds painful, but this is the way to get your finances under control and you will be able to maintain your pride and integrity.  Living within your means will open your eyes and help you to find money that you can use to pay down your debts.  If you can get a job at night and / or on weekends, do it.

"9","How do I tell my wife she is seriously overweight and is sexually unappealing to me?","When I married my wife five years ago, she was 5' tall, and about 100 lbs. She was very petite and pretty. I am very attracted to women who are slim and petite. She has since put on about thirty five pounds. She is almost in complete denial about it. For example, she doesn't understand why her jeans don't fit anymore. This woman is intelligent. I don't find her sexually attractive now. She keeps asking me, ""Do you think I'm overweight?"", ""Do you think my stomach is fat?"", ""Do you think I'm ugly?"" How do I say, ""Yes, you are so fat that you barely resemble the person I married. I don't want to make love to you because I no longer feel attracted to you."" ???","Are things or situations putting a lot of stress on your wife? Have you and your wife had any kids yet? Have you gained weight yourself? What things have happened in your lives such as eating habits and changes in lifestyle that might have encouraged this weight gain? \nFor one don't divorce her. Two, hopefully you married her on a higher level beyond her looks even though that also was an attraction you had towards her. Also for her to ask you she is already aware of the fact that she has gained this weight and would probably would like to hear such things like, ""We can do it together, take it one step at a time,etc..."" Do things with her like eating healthy, and exercising, so she knows she has your support in it. Also, try different sexual positions, be more exotic and make love to her because she wants it not just because you want it. Sex can also be a very exciting and fun way to lose weight. If all this doesn't work and you still don't find her sexually attractive then this is beyond her weight and I would advice you get help."

"6","Who conquered Mt Everest for the first time & When?","","Mt. Everest was conquored by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, as widely recognized and recorded in history. But, this topic is controvercial.On June 8, 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, both of the United Kingdom, made an attempt on the summit from which they never returned. Noel Odell, the expedition's geologist, wrote in his diary that he ""saw M&I on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramid"" at 12:50 pm that day. In 1979 climber Wang Hongbao of China revealed to a companion that he had discovered a body in 1975 thought at the time to be Irvine's, but he unfortunately was killed in a fall the very next day before he could provide precise details to anyone else.\n\nIn 1999, however, the famous Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found instead Mallory's body in the predicted search area near the old Chinese camp. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community as to whether the duo may have made it to the top of the world, 29 years before the confirmed ascent (and of course, safe descent) of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953."

"5","how do companies make money by giving software for free?","","Depends on the company.\n\nThe AVG and AntiVir free anti-virus software is given away free to individuals to advertise the business versions of those products.\n\nA lot of open source software (gcc, xemacs, etc.) is given away free and the programmers charge for a manual teling you all the cool tricks under the surface. Red Hat, SUSE and IBM all support Linux, so can invest in the software on the back of massive support contracts with people running Linux.\n\nSoftware such as Firefox is supported by selling merchandise and by getting a cut from Google for having the Google bar installed by default and Google as the default home page.\n\nOpera's free edition used to be supported by adverts in the browser, for which they were payed. Many small companies go down this route.\n\nThere are also some dodgy pieces of software which you can download for free that install rubbish onto your computer, that either dials premium rate numbers using your modem, or steals your information to sell to criminals.

"2","How do planes fly upside down?","I understand that a combination of Bernoulli's theorem and the shape of a wing's cross section allow a plane to fly right way up, but when a wing is inverted, using the same logic, the plane should be fall to the ground. Obviously it doesn't, so my question is how does it stay in the air?","More than Bernoulli's principle and wing shape (airfoil) are at work in keeping a plane in the air. The main criteria is the  ""angle of attack"" of the wing. That is, the angle at which the wing meets the air passing by it. When a plane is flying, its wing is always at a positive angle of attack; the leading edge of the wing is higher relative to the air going over it than the trailing edge. So the air pushes the wing up.  When the plane is inverted, the angle of attack must be great enough to overcome the ""negative lift""  created by the airfoil. This is accomplished by adjusting the elevator. Inverted flight will always require the input of down elevator."

"5","Is there a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given string ?","","Here's a java solution that uses recursion.  The permute function takes two arguments: a done portion and a todo portion.   The basic idea is that each of the characters in the todo portion could be the next character.  So, at each step, n recursive calls are made, where n is the length of todo.  Each call chooses a different character as the next character to go into the done portion.  So, the first time the number of recursive calls will equal the number of characters in the initial string.  Each of these calls will make further recursive calls equal to the number of characters in the initial string minus one.  And so on.  Thus, the number of solutions will be n! = n*n-1*n-2*...*1, where n is the number of characters in the initial string.\n\nThe program below was tested with java's sun compiler 1.4.2.\npublic class perm\n{\n  public perm(String S)\n  {     \n    permute("""", S);\n  }     \n  public void permute(String done, String todo) \n  {     \n    if ((todo.length()==0)||\n        (todo.equals("""")))\n      System.out.println(done);\n    else        \n    {           \n      for (int i=0; i<todo.length(); i++)\n      {                 \n        String c = todo.substring(0,1);\n        todo = todo.substring(1);\n        permute(done+c, todo);  \n        todo = todo + c;        \n      }                 \n    }           \n  }     \n  public static void main(String args[])\n  {     \n    if ((args.length==0)||\n        (args[0].length()==0)||\n        (args[0].equals("""")))\n      return;           \n    perm p = new perm(args[0]);\n  }     \n}"

"1","When did people start calling each other ""dude""?","","The original meaning of this American-born word is still its first definition today, 'a man excessively concerned with his clothes, grooming and manners'. I thought that dude was an old word, but I thought wrong. I guess it's because the word sounds vaguely like duke, and all those titles of royalty are fairly ancient. But dude first appeared in print in 1878. The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang cites an 1877 reference in a letter--not published, however, until 1988--from the painter and sculptor Frederick Remington: ""Don't send me any more [drawings of] women or any more dudes."" By 1883, dude was in wider circulation. In June of that year, its popularity was noted by Massachusetts’ North Adams Transcript: ""The new coined word 'dude'...has travelled over the country with a great deal of rapidity since but two months ago it grew into general use in New York."" By 1885, it had established a strong enough foothold to appear in Ulysses S. Grant's Personal Memoirs: ""Before the car I was in had started, a dapper little fellow--he would be called a dude at this day--stepped in.""\n\nFairly soon, a dude came to mean an Easterner or a city slicker, and especially someone who vacations on a ranch--thus dude ranch.\n\nDude also spawned quite a few odd derivatives, such as dudedom, dudeness, dudery, dudism, dudish, dudess and dudine--the last two meaning 'female dudes'. None of these is in general use today. I thought dudess might have had a revival as part of the surfer culture; however, Malia Alani of Surfer Magazine said no. She e-mailed me that ""I don't think there is a feminine word for dude. A traditional Hawaiian word used commonly for women surfers is wahine."" (Note: following the appearance of the column, several readers have informed me that dudette is the feminine form of dude. A quick search of Nexis confirms the word is, in fact, current. Thanks, everyone.)\n\nThe meaning of the word as 'a male person' has been in wide use since the 1960's. This is from a 1968 book called College Drug Scene: ""And I got into symbolic logic and semantics with a cat who had studied with Korzybski and electronics from a dude who had an Associate of Arts degree in anthropology from 1941."" The use of dude in direct address to a male began much earlier. This is from a 1945 book called Silversides: ""Hey, dude, there's a ship out here!""\n\nThe origin of dude is uncertain. There are a few speculations, the most interesting of which, to my mind, is from A Dictionary of Slang by Eric Partridge. He says that it may have come from the word dud--which, at the time, meant 'a delicate weakling'--""influenced by attitude."""

The people who are blocking the content only can tell that you went the the proxy site but will not know where you went using that. I have listed some below. You can also configure your computer to automatically use a proxy server.

Both will get you buy the ""firewall"" that you seem to have.  Using an anonymous proxy prevents the website that you are browsing from knowing who you are, they think that you are the proxy server.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \nA proxy server is a computer network service that allows clients to make indirect network connections to other network services. A client connects to the proxy server, then requests a connection, file, or other resource available on a different server. The proxy provides the resource either by connecting to the specified server or by serving it from a cache. In some cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for various purposes."

The difference is that the structure will let users add specific styles to each type, and add links and pictures for reviews.\n\nThese styles and tags ensure that movie and book reviews don't look like calendar or journal entries, and that each content type can be quickly recognized and processed by automated search services and other applications. Woven into the HTML of a blog post, this information travels with it through syndication feeds, readers, and aggregators. Ultimately, it can even be converted out to other formats our Structured Blogging tools support such as RDF in XML."

"5","do you prefer DLS or CABLE internet?","","Cable and DSL are two different types of internet services. Cable runs on the same line that brings you cable tv, while DSL runs on a phone line. Cable is significantly faster than DSL, and in some cases can be more than 5X the speed of DSL in residential areas. Although DSL is a lot cheaper than cable internet, speed is mainly what people need."

"7","i want to take classes to become an auto insurance agent, where do i look?","","You'll want to get 3 licenses:\nP&C license (Property & Casualty)\nLife & Health license\nSecurities License (Depending on the state that you live in, this could mean a Series 6 & 63 OR Series 7)\nThe reason is that most auto insurance agencies now sell auto, home, life and investments.  Even if you put a specialist in your office to sell the other stuff you will still need to have the licenses to get commissions on them.\nI would talk to Erie Insurance.  They sell as independent agents and offer more than one company.  This can be very important.  Lets say you own a State Farm agency and then six months from now they have a huge rate increase.  You lose half your customers and can't do anything about it.  Go independent and those same customers can call you up and you can rewrite them with a different company.

I've been looking at the TennCare site (1st URL below) for a while, and it's not particularly useful. You might try their Family Assistance telephone number (866-311-4287), which is from their Important numbers page (2nd URL). Over on the State of TN xite, I found a list of HMOs whose doctors accept TennCare (3rd URL). A fairly generic county-by-county database of health resources (bigger things like health departments & community clinics) can be found at the 4th URL. Finally, the TennHelp site (5th URL) offers a fairly involved search for providers. The 6th URL points to the last step in the search process, where you just choose what county you're in and hit the Search Now button. The cadeuceus icon beside search results indicates providers who offer ""reduced-cost or free health services to low-income or uninsured Tennesseans."""
"2","“A runner can never reach the end of a racecourse”, is it true?","Suppose the runner travels at the constant speed and suppose it takes him T minutes to cover the first half of the course. The next quarter of the course will take T/2 minutes, the next eight will takeT/4 minutes, and, in general the portion  from 1/2^n to ½^n+1 will take T/2^n minutes. The sum of all these time intervals may be indicated symbolically by writing the following expression:\n\n         T+T/2+T/4+…….+T/2^n +……..\nThis it clearly an infinite serie, but our physical experience tells us that a runner who travels at a constant speed should reach his goal in twice the time it takes for him to reach the halfway point.","****Edit to clarify******\nWhile the professor below is correct, and the poster below him is partially correct, you can only assume that the course is complete if you include the finite answer as an infinate series.\n\nThe prime example of this is that 1.999 repeating is NOT equal to 2.0 unless 2.0 is infinite, ie 2.000000 repeating.  You can not deal with unlike in infinate numbers.  Ie, you can not translate an infinite number to a finite number and still have the same premise.  \n\nSo unless the data deals with an infinate equality, the runner never will reach his destination.\n*********end edit***********\n\nWhile it is true that the runner will finish the course, as we know that every course has a start and ending point; in regards to math, unless the start and end are constants and predefined, the answer is simple:  THe runner will never reach the end.  The reason for this is that without a predefined set of start and end, the course is continous."

"10","What states have no law requiring breaks for workers?","What states, other than Virginia, have no law requiring employers to give rest or meal breaks in an eight-hour workday?","Few states require lunch or rest breaks, if any.  I know that for most employees over the age of 18 in even more politically liberal states like New Jersey do not require rest breaks.  Of course, many states regulate such for minors, but few for workers over the age of 18.\n\nI've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks.  It's a pretty short list: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nFor rest breaks, the list shrinks to California, Colorad, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.\n\nPerhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable.  Perhaps few regulate because unions, often providing the strongest labor law components in states, don't really care if non-unionized labor is forced to receive breaks, but really works hard to ensure that its own members are protected through contract agreements and bargaining.  Regardless, I hope this information helps."

"2","What is the most difficult topic in upper-division college mathematics?","","It largely depends on the individual. Courses that emphasize theory (proving theorems) are generally harder than courses that merely involve performing calculations. There are basically four branches of mathematics: Analysis (calculus), Algebra, Geometry/Topology, and Foundational (Set theory and some metamathematical stuff). These are all quite abstract on the upper division level but often times an individual will have a higher aptitude in one or two over the others. I, for instance, found a fairly advanced abstract algebra course much easier than an introduction to analysis class. Also keep in mind that people that are drawn to math pure mathematics can usually get through the undergraduate material without too much difficulty. Individuals who are taking advanced mathematics courses to satisfy the requirements of some related program (education, engineering, business, etc) may find some of the more abstract material quite challenging. If your question pertains mostly to the latter case, then I'd just say that a good rule of thumb is that the difficulty of the course is probably directly proportional to the number prerequites. Differential Equations would probably be a good example since it should require about 3 semesters of calculus and linerar algrebra at least."

"7","How to combat competition which underprices well below margins and has no business ethics?","The competition even goes to the extent of bribing the purchase dept and using other cheap methods for getting orders .","In my experience, companies like this eventually get their's in the long run...generally if they lack ethics in their dealings with clients they also lack it internally...in their Accounting and Finance and HR functions too. You have seen a lot of companies who acted this way make headlines within the past few years (Enron, Worldcom, Lucent, etc), so we know that it does eventually does catch up with them...\n\nHowever, none of that solves your short-term dilemma so what I would recommend is a multi-part strategy that includes a lot of emphasis on what you do well. Differentiate your products, differentiate your services, stand head-and-shoulders over your competition in providing a great experience. Sure you could try to compete on margins, but in the end that only makes you have to sell harder and faster and could eventually bankrupt the company. \n\nI believe that just as there is room for cheaper and faster there is also room for creating a great buying / purchasing experience. Why else would companies like Mercedes Benz, Audi and BMW be around? They don't try to compete with Honda, Hyundai and Nissan. They cater to a specific clientele and show the value of their products...from the sales process to the service cycle, I think a similar approach, while a lot of work may be the only way to compete effectively.\n\nIf you spend your time fighting competitors like you have described above you waste valuable time that you could be better servicing your existing clients. Focus on them and they will in turn become your best source of leads and word of mouth advertising."

Your library surely has sturdy board books with colorful pictures to look at. \nTake him outside and help him explore around the yard, park, wherever. \nAt that age it takes time to absorb new information, so don't rush, take your time and repeat things that hold his attention.\nSee what your son responds to best.\nThe games you play now will not be much fun for you but the relationship and mental foundation you are builidng now will pay off later.

"1","Is the Catholic Church is the true Christian & Historical church that Jesus established? If not, then why?","Historical, meaning that you can trace the origin throughtout time of the church to the 12 Apostle to Jesus Christ.","The Catholic Church is NOT the first Christian church and is certainly not the one that Christ established or would have approved of. Their teachings, practices, and doctrines are not in harmony with the scriptures that Christ cherished so dearly. In the first century Christian congregation there was no allowance for a pope, there was no blasphemous teaching of a trinity, and Mary certainly wasn't venerated as she is today.\n\nPeter is not the ""rock"" that Christ was referring to. Catholics always tend to get this scripture incorrect. The context (the surrounding verses) are speaking about Jesus Christ, not Peter. Christ was simply talking to Peter about it, not making Peter the cornerstone of the congregation because Jesus himself is the head of the congregation."

"2","what is global warming ? how does it heat up the earth?","","Global warming has two main applications. The first is that there are certain gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, warming planets. This is known to take place on Venus, Earth, and the gas giants. Earth is the hospitable place that it is because of global warming.\n\nThis takes place because of greenhouse gases, which allow radiation from the sun to pass through the atmosphere and warm the surface of the earth. The surface then re-radiates this energy back towards space in the infrared spectrum. This energy would escape and our planet would be as cold as the moon, were it not for the greenhouse gases (mainly CO2, ozone, methane, and water vapor). They absorb the infrared energy and radiate it back to earth, increasing the overall amount of radiation hitting the earth's surface, keeping it warm day and night.\n\nThat this takes place is clear and indisputable. There is simply too little energy coming from the sun to account for our planet's temperature. The controversial point is when global warming is applied to the current rise in average global temperature that has taken place over the past 50 so years. Most scientists believe that warming of the planet is due to increases in greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, mainly due to human activities on earth."

President Clinton was investigated by Kenneth Starr for a variety of allegations, including sexual harassment allegations brought forth by Paula Jones.  In the depositions Clinton made, he denied under oath that he ever had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, which related to the sexual harassment charges on sexual impropriety.  When it came forward that Lewinsky had physical evidence that proved the affair, Clinton recanted his story.  Starr believed that a four charges had sufficient proof to be legitimate grounds for impeachment: perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and abuse of authority.\n\nIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr brought these charges before the House, and the House impeaced Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges.  The Senate failed to convict Clinton on either charge.\n\nThe Answers.com link below provides a concise summary of the events and justification that led to impeachment."

"1","is there any evidence to a pre christian camino de santiago?","","Yes, Wikipedia says:\n\n""Prior to its existence as a Catholic pilgrimage, the route is believed to also have had significance for the ancient pagan peoples of the Iberian peninsula, among them the Celts, and later the Romans who conquered northern Spain. The site of Santiago de Compostela itself may have been perhaps a Roman shrine.\n\nTo this day many of the pilgrims continue on from Santiago de Compostela to the Atlantic coast of Galicia to finish their pilgrimage at Cape Finisterre (Fisterra in Galician) which is almost the westernmost point of Europe. The fact that the Romans called it Finisterrae (literally the end of the world in Latin) indicates that it was seen as a sacred place.\n\nPagan influences can still be seen along the Way; indeed some of the modern-day pilgrims themselves are attracted more to the pagan legends associated with the Way rather than the Christian."""

"2","Why 220V amplitude for domestic ac circuits?","In India, we use 220V as the amplitude of the sinusoidal ac current in our houses. The reasons for choosing this particularly odd value are historical. But my question is - what? What is the reason for this convention?","I could suggest several considerations.  First P=IE, that is Power equals the electrical current (I in Amperes) times the voltage (E in volts).  Current is like the flow of water in a pipe and voltage is like the pressure causing the water to flow.  If you use the water to drive a hydraulic piston (say to hoist an automobile for repair) you can use either a small piston and high pressure or a larger piston and lower pressure.  Which is more cost effective?\n\nIn the United States, electric power is delivered to neighborhoods using three wires (three phases) strung along telephone (power) poles.  Only two of the wires are led to a single residence but the neighborhood must use all three wires to balance load on the wires.  Within a house electricity passes from only one wire (phase) to ground or earth to light a lightbulb which uses 110 volts.  The clothes dryer that needs far more power is connected between two of the supply wires (two phase) and to ground to supply 220 volts.  A machine shop might connect a very large motor to all three supply wires to obtain even more power at 440 volts.\n\nSix volts or even 12 volts DC in an automobile circuit can be touched with little danger.  It is less dangerous to accidentally touch a 110 volt AC wire than a 220 volt source and 440 volts is most dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the selection of voltage depends in part on safety and then on the size of the job to be tackled and also economic factors.  The higher the required current, the larger the required wires using expensive copper.  Increasing the voltage reduces the needed current and reduces the needed copper to do a given job.  The higher the required voltage, the more expensive the required electrical insulation will be.  Engineers must determine the best trade off of many factors."

"2","What is the preffered route to anodization of Alumina?","","The overall reaction that takes place during  anodization is:\n\n2Al + 3H2O ==> Al2O3 + 3H2\n\nThis is the sum of the separate reactions at each electrode. The reactions at the anode occur at the metal/oxide and oxide/ electrolyte interfaces. The ions that make up the oxide are mobile under the high field conditions. At the metal/oxide interface the inward moving oxygen anions react with the metal:\n\n2Al + 3O2- ==> Al2O3 + 6e-\n\nAt the oxide/electrolyte interface outward moving aluminum cations react with water:\n\n2Al3+ + 3H2O ==> Al2O3 + 6H+\n\n(In case of aluminum dissolution into the electrolyte during porous film formation, the anodic reaction is:\n\n2Al ==> 2Al3+ + 6e-)\n\nThe reaction at the cathode is hydrogen gas evolution:\n\n6H+ + 6e- ==> 3H2\n\nThe sealing reaction can be written as:\n\nAl2O3 + 3H2O ==> 2AlOOH*H2O \n\nchk the link.it is very informative."
"10","Do our representatives retain any honesty/integrity once they are elected into office?","Who can we trust?","It seems that the longer they are in office, the more influence they gain, but the more they seem to be seduced by the power they control.  Of course the only way to retain it is to stay in office, and that means money.  The temptation to take help from wealthy special interests is almost too much to resist.  Then, of course, begins the slippery slide down from integrity to political punch line.\n\nThis doesn't mean that all politicians are corrupt; it just means it's pretty hard to tell which ones are honest and which aren't.\n\nThe problem is how to fix it--if it ever is.  The only way is with REAL campaign finance reform that completely changes the way candidates get money.  But such change must be enacted by Congress, and there's just too much self-interest involved to get any real change enacted.  So there you go..."

The concept in fact would be contrary to most Gnostic believes.  Here's a quick quote from Thomas:\n\n(77) Jesus says:\n(1) ""I am the light that is over all. I am the All.\nThe All came forth out of me. And to me the All has come.""\n(2) ""Split a piece of wood – I am there.\n(3) Lift the stone, and you will find me there.""\n\nThomas is a ""sayings gospel.""  Unlike the Gospels that are in the Bible, it has no narrative.  It is just one Jesus quote after another.  Many scholars assign a first century date to Thomas, so it is at least possible that it is very old.\n\nGnostics believe that the material world is evil, and therefore God would never take the form of a man.  Gnostics have what is called a docetic view of Christ.  That is that he only appeared to be human, and had none of the actual physical characteristics of a human.  The goal of Gnostics is to escape the limitations and evil of this physical world and return to the spiritual world they believe we came from.\n\nGnosis.org is a great resource for gnostic information and has several copies of the Gospel of Thomas"

"10","why the Us did not sign the Kioto Protocol?","","The Kyoto Protocol is unfair and misleading. America would have been very heavily taxed and it's economy slowed down greatly if it had signed. The rest of the world argued that the US should pay the lion's share because it contributes more pollution than anyone else. What everyone disregards is that the US also produces more than anyone else. It's all proportional. It also excluded developing countries with no environmental policies whatsoever from contributing. If any country in the developing world had an economy as productive as the US, they would produce far more pollution than the US does. The Kyoto Protocol was a blatant and transparent attempt to hurt the US economy in the name of a problem that nobody has even been able to confirm."

"2","Can somebody be brought back to life after being cryogenically frozen? Or is it a hoax?","","well probably... well they would still be alive while frozen, if they can get the temperatures low enough, it would slow everything down enough so that the person would not die because the processes in the body would have all slowed down tremendously.  this would not prevent aging and the biological processes, so the person would starve and stuff eventually, but it would slow everything down so dramatically that the person could last for years and years while their body only goes through the processes of like one day or so.  The temperature would also have to be dropped very very quickly this way the body wouldnt have a chance to realize it was being frozen.  The only problem would be then to unfreeze the person very very rapidly back to their normal temperature so the body is never in that in between state where it would start to shut off blood supply to the extremeties(legs and arms) in order to conserve heat for the organs(this is the normal response to temperatures that are too cold), because then the person may have to have something amputated. but if they can just unfreeze them super-fast without using too much heat(because if they used too much heat, it could burn them or denature the persons enzymes closer to the surface which would kill them.)  with technology on the express lane that it seems to be on now, im sure they can develop a method for this rapid freezing and rapid thawing.  i mean, think of computers and such, technology is going crazy."

"5","what the different between Linux and Microsoft?","","Wow, this could potentially be a very, very long answer. However, I'll try to boil it down to its most basic element:\n\nMicrosoft is a for profit company.  It makes and sells software, such as Windows and Office, to make money.  You usually buy their software in a store or indirectly when you purchase a new computer.\n\nLinux is not a company.  Linux is the name of the operating system (comparable to Microsoft's Windows).  No one company makes Linux.  The core of the Linux operating system is called the ""kernel"" (Microsoft has one too) and it is developed and maintained by volunteers.  That's right, volunteers that aren't paid for their work spend time creating Linux.  The companies you may have heard in the context of Linux like RedHat and Suse make money by taking the kernel that is freely available and packaging it in a manner that makes it easy to use and install - while also offering support if you need help.  These companies are less software makers like Microsoft and more like software support and packaging companies.  However, this is a very basic example - most of the Linux companies also have their development on top of the base operating system that provides a lot of value to the distribution.\n\nLinux also has some distributions (what the different versions of Linux are called) that are maintained solely by volunteers and are not sold but given away.  Debian is a great Linux distribution that does this as are Ubuntu, Slackware, Gentoo etc...  So, these are not Linux companies, but Linux communties as they do not exist to make money.\n\nIn summary, Linux is a type of operating system developed by a volunteer community while Microsoft is its own company that makes and sells software including the Windows Operating system and the Office productivity suite."

"1","Why do Muslims believe Mohammed is the messiah when he showed no proof by miracles?","And writting a book is not a miracle, since there are many today that also write books.","Why do you need proof to have faith? The definition of faith is believing without seeing.  Jesus makes reference to this many times in the Bible.  He didn't want to perform miracles because he didn't want to have to prove who he was.  He just wanted people to believe. I mean, isn't it kind of an insult to someone when you ask for proof?  It means you don't trust that person and you can't have a relationship without trust.

Ownership of land is an aspect of the system of real property or realty in common law systems (immovables in civil law systems and Conflict of Laws). \nAll other property is considered personal property or personalty in common law systems (movables in civil law and Conflict of Laws), and this property is either tangible or intangible, i.e. it is either physical property that can be touched like a computer, or it is an enforceable right like a patent or other form of intellectual property. \nThere are three separate levels of rights or interests affecting both forms of property. In descending order of importance they are:\n\nownership, \npossession or \ncontrol and use. \nThe legal documents that transfer these rights are respectively: conveyance/transfer, lease/tenancy, and bailment/pledge for tangible personalty, assignments and licenses for intangibles."
"7","What or who is a Gant?","In Essex, United Kingdom there is a town called Gants Hill. It is on the Central Line of the London Underground system. Most towns that have multiple words in their name and when the 1st word ends in an S, are normally named after a ""thing"".\n\nIn this instance the thing is a Gant and after living for 33 years in this area and not having found the answer please help me :)","There are two possible explanations for the origin of the name Gants Hill. It could derive from the  le Gant family. Gantesgrave appears as early as 1291. In 1321 Ralph le Gant was steward of Barking Abbey, and Richard and Gilbert le Gant were stewards in 1456. There are also theories that the name derives from Gnats Cross*. The area was originally a swamp and was the habitat of swarms of flying insects otherwise known as gnats. Wealthy local landowner Lord Parham had the area drained in 1803 and the village that sprung up in this area became known as Gnat's Cross. This changed to Hill due to cases of religious discrimination. Gnat's probably became Gants due to a printing error in the reproduction of local maps."
"2","Where, if no universe existed did the dense ball of hydrogen reside in before the big bang?","","""Where?"" requires the existance of space. There was no space before the Big Bang. We cannot even talk about ""before"", since there was no time, either. It's counterintuitive and cannot be assessed in a normal state of mind - logic won't help here, even a twisted one. Science struggles to answer the questions regarding the very beginning. What is known, however, is that right after the Big Bang there was no hydrogen - it was too hot for it to form. First quark-gluon plasma, then protons and neutrons, then hydrogen atoms. So it took some time, though, given the age of the Universe, it occurred almost instantaneously."

"7","I want the history of the 12 days of christmas?","The catichism version...1500's","The Twelve Days of Christmas is probably the most misunderstood part of the church year among Christians who are not part of liturgical church traditions. Contrary to much popular belief, these are not the twelve days before Christmas, but in most of the Western Church are the twelve days from Christmas until the beginning of Epiphany  (January 6th; the 12 days count from December 25th until January 5th). In some traditions, the first day of Christmas begins on the evening of December 25th but the following day is considered the First Day of Christmas (December 26th).\n\nThe origin of the Twelve Days is complicated, and is related to differences in calendars, church traditions, and ways to observe this holy day in various cultures (see Christmas).  In the Western church, Epiphany is traditionally celebrated as the time the three Wise Men or Magi arrived to present gifts to the young Jesus (Matt. 2:1-12). In some cultures, especially Hispanic and Latin American culture, January 6th is observed as Three Kings Day, or simply the Day of the Kings (Span: la Fiesta de Reyes, el Dia de los Tres Reyes, or el Dia de los Reyes Magos; Dutch: Driekoningendag).  Even though December 25th is celebrated as Christmas in these cultures, January 6th is often the day for giving gifts. In some places it is traditional to give Christmas gifts for each of the Twelve Days of Christmas. Since Eastern Orthodox traditions use a different religious calendar, they celebrate Christmas on January 7th and observe Epiphany or Theophany on January 19th.\n\nBy the 16th century, some European and Scandinavian cultures had combined the Twelve Days of Christmas with (sometimes pagan) festivals celebrating the changing of the year. These were usually associated with driving away evil spirits for the start of the new year. \n\nThe Twelfth Night is January 5th, the last day of the Christmas Season before Epiphany (January 6th). In some church traditions, January 5th is considered the eleventh Day of Christmas, while the evening of January 5th is still counted as the Twelfth Night, the beginning of the Twelfth day of Christmas the following day.  Twelfth Night often included feasting along with the removal of Christmas decorations. French and English celebrations of Twelfth Night included a King's Cake, remembering the visit of the Three Magi, and ale or wine (a King's Cake is part of the observance of Mardi Gras in French Catholic culture of the Southern USA).  In some cultures, the King's Cake was part of the celebration of the day of Epiphany. \n\nThe popular song ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" is usually seen as simply a nonsense song for children. However, some have suggested that it is a song of Christian instruction dating to the 16th century religious wars in England, with hidden references to the basic teachings of the Faith.  They contend that it was a mnemonic device to teach the catechism to youngsters. The ""true love"" mentioned in the song is not an earthly suitor, but refers to God Himself. The ""me"" who receives the presents refers to every baptized person who is part of the Christian Faith. Each of the ""days"" represents some aspect of the Christian Faith that was important for children to learn.\n\nHowever, many have questioned the historical accuracy of this origin of the song The Twelve Days of Christmas.  It seems that some have made an issue out of trying to debunk this as an ""urban myth,"" some in the name of historical accuracy and some out of personal agendas.  There is little ""hard"" evidence available either way.  Some church historians affirm this account as basically accurate, while others point out apparent historical discrepancies. However, the ""evidence"" on both sides is mostly in logical deduction and probabilities.  One internet site devoted to debunking hoaxes and legends says that, ""there is no substantive evidence to demonstrate that the song 'Th"

"2","If space is a vacuum, how does light travel through it?","Or could a vacuum be defined as being devoid of physical matter but still can contain energy?","Light has nothing to do with space. It is a property of the electromagnetic field when this field is undergoing changes. from its point of origin, this field radiates out into space in all directions. It is invisible, but can be felt by charged particles. When this field is changed, for instance by suddenly altering the position of its emitter, a kink develops in the field which propagates out into space at the speed of light. Under the right circumstances of acceleration, this kink becomes electromagnetic radiation - light. So space simply acts as a passive container for the electromagnetic field, which in turn is the 'medium' in which light exists."

What God tells us is not to trust Satan, even not to communicate with him under any circumstances. Those who are certain that Satan exists will either avoid him(as the result of knowing he is 'person' not to be trusted) or follow him because they reject God. In the end, I think that Satan is very pleased when people consider he doesn't exist, cause in that way he can fool them undercover."

"2","What is the coefficient of static friction? And why does it matter?","","The coefficient of friction is the ratio of the force needed to push an object and make it slide divided by the force downward on the object (e.g., weight) resisting motion.  It is used to determine the amount of force that is needed to make a smooth surfaced object of one material slide on a smooth surface of the same or a different material.  For every combination of materials there is a specific coefficient of friction.  Once calculated, the coefficient can be used for various loads (size of object).  Ice on teflon has one of the lowest coefficients of friction.  If you place an object on a plank and raise one end almost every object will slide before you reach an angle of 45 degrees.  Objects that have an adhesive property or are especially rough or have cogs will not have true coefficients of friction.  Once the coefficient of friction is known for a combination of materials (e.g., as determined in a lab) it can be used in many mechanical calculations where friction is present although the motion is more complicated than sliding along a floor.\n\nAn extra effort is sometimes needed to get an object to slide initially that is greater than steady state friction and that is sometimes called stiction."

"3","how do you get meningitis?","","Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The inflammation is usually caused by bacteria or viruses (viral meningitis is also called aseptic meningitis). Less common causes include fungi, protozoa, and other parasites. Sometimes certain medications, cancers, or other diseases can inflame the meninges, although such noninfectious cases of meningitis are much rarer.\n\nMany of the bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis are fairly common and are more often associated with other everyday illnesses. Sometimes, however, they spread to the meninges from an infection in another part of the body. The infection can start anywhere, including in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary system, but the most common source is the respiratory tract. From there the microorganisms can enter the bloodstream, travel through the body, and enter the central nervous system. In some cases of bacterial meningitis, the bacteria spread directly to the meninges from a severe nearby infection, such as a serious ear infection (otitis media) or nasal sinus infection (sinusitis). Bacteria may also enter the central nervous system after severe head trauma or head surgery. \n\nBacterial meningitis is less common than viral meningitis but is usually much more serious and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Many different types of bacteria can cause meningitis: Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes are the most common causes of meningitis in newborns. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) are more frequent in children older than 2 months of age. Before the 1990s, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading cause of meningitis in children in the United States. But the widespread use of the Hib vaccine as a routine childhood immunization has dramatically decreased the frequency of meningitis caused by Hib.\n\nViral meningitis is relatively common and far less serious than bacterial meningitis. It often remains undiagnosed because its symptoms are similar to those of the common flu. The frequency of viral meningitis increases slightly in the summer and fall months because people are more often exposed to common viral agents during those seasons. Most cases of viral meningitis are associated with enteroviruses - viruses that typically cause stomach ""flu."" However, many other types of viruses, such as the herpes virus, can also cause meningitis. The mumps virus was once a common cause of viral meningitis, but it is now rare due to the routine use of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nBacterial meningitis occurs in people of all ages but is more common in the very young (infants and young children) and the elderly (people above age 60). Teenagers and college students are also slightly more at risk for the disease because of time spent in close contact with many of their peers. Viral meningitis occurs in people of all ages, although it is more common in children.\n\nPeople with less competent immune systems, such as the very young or those whose immune systems have been compromised by disease, are more at risk for all types of meningitis. Some types are more common in child-care centers, boarding schools, dormitories, and military bases, mainly because infectious diseases tend to spread quickly among large groups of people. Not receiving routine vaccines for certain infectious agents that can cause meningitis - including those for mumps, Hib, and pneumococcus - also increases a person's risk for the disease.\n\nThe long-term outlook for children who develop meningitis varies greatly and depends on a child's age, the microorganism causing the infection, any other complications, and the treatment the child receives. The complications of bacterial meningitis can be severe and include neurological problems such as hearing loss, visual impairment, seizures, and learning disabiliti"

I use a gentle exfoliant (Clean and Clear Pore Cleanser), because harsh beads tends to scratch the skin and actually cause breakouts. I use that in the shower. Then at night, I always use gentle cleansing cloths to wash my face before bed. Usually this is all I need to do. By using string acne meds, it can not only cause more dryness, but also cause more breakouts because when your skin gets dry, it produces oils to try and fight it, and can cause more breakouts. Then I have a facial lotion that is oil free and not supposed to cause breakouts (its a SPF 15 stuff from Clean and Clear I believe) in the morning after a shower to moisturize. \n\nAlso, I have been told to use steam before washing your face. It helps the oily parts without overdrying the dry parts."

"4","how does the last name walker relate to a profession?","","Well, there was that show on the USA Network called ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" focused on the exploits of a Texas Ranger called Cordell Walker.

"2","how do molluscs grow their shells?","","Molluscs have an organ known as a mantle. It is the body wall covering beneath the shell. The outer layer of this organ secretes calcium carbonate using calcium from its blood. They can also secrete some proteins which give the shells colors and patterns while the mollusc is living. The inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre, which is a composite of calcium carbonate and organic materials. This is the material that makes the inner part of the shell iridescent, and the coating that makes pearls."
"3","I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BIPOLAR OVER A YEAR AGO I STOP TAKIN MY MEDS A MONTH AFTER THAT. SHOULD I TAKE THEM AGAIN","","The word ""bipolar"" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a ""mental illness"", and promotes it as a ""disease"" that requires ""treatment"".\n\nIt is not a ""disease"", despite claims or implications made by certain psychiatric or pharmaceutical organisations. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes ""bipolar"" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or ""chemical imbalance"".\n\n""For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign."" Fred Baughman, MD., Neurologist & Pediatric Neurologist.\n\n""Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea."" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as ""bipolar"" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people, for example, have overcome ""bipolar"" through megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including symptoms labelled as ""schizophrenia"" [See source refs]\n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a ""faith"", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called ""research"" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that ""schizophrenia"" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nFor information on non-drug / alternative approaches:\n- http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#B\n- http://www.pendulum.org/articles/articles_misc_lisaalt.html\n- http://www.truehope.com/_empowerplus/empowerplus.asp\n- http://www.mentalhealthproject.com/content.asp?id_Content=1575"

"4","ARE TEACHERS REALY SMART OR DO TEY JUST ACT?","","Well, teachers are usually specialized in the area that they are teaching.  So while they might be smart at one thing, they might not know anything about another subject.  This is not to say that teacher's do know all about the subject matter at hand.  They learn new things while they teach also.  \n\nHere's a bad analogy:\nIt's like reading a book more than two times.  You always see more the second time around.  Therefore, this effect might take place while teaching from a book.\n\nNow, there are some teachers who don't know how to teach very well, so I guess you might call this an ""act.""  but, I would call it ""practice."""
"4","My teacher is a royal pain, should i be the worst student?","","No. If you are a good student you need to stay that way.

They don't know what to think and you can't get in trouble for being nice. It is a win win situation."

I could either pay off the mortage or buy another 4% tax-free bond.","I just asked myself this question a couple of months ago. I ran a spread sheet with a side by side comparison of my 6 1/2% 30 year mortgage versus an equal dollar amount invested at 5% for the same term. You would expect to save quite a bit paying off the debt but you actuality save by keeping the mortgage."
"6","I need to adjust my bicycle brakes on my kids bike. When I release the handle one side of the brakes rubs?","","This is assuming that the wheels on your son's bike are true (laterally straight and perfectly round).\n\nIf the bike has caliper style brakes, you should be able to center the brakes by taking an open ended box wrench to the centering bolt (commonly 13 mm). This bolt usually sits right behind the spring for the brake calipers.\n\nIf the brakes are cantilevers (mountain bike style, not disc), then you have two options. Some brakes will have a spring tension adjusting bolt on the side of each cantilever (a small, recessed allen bolt). To eliminate the rub, increase the spring tension on the side that is rubbing, or decrease the spring tension on the side that isn't.\n\nIf your cantilevers don't have these bolts, you can do it in a more crude fashion by preloading the spring by pulling the cantilever away from the wheel to try to increase the tension.\n\nGood luck."

"2","how enzymes work, including the role of the enzyme-substrate complex?","","Wow... that's a question that could be answered on many different levels, and you're optimistic as hell to think you can get a ""real"" answer here. Basically, an enzyme provides a micro-enviroment that is very conducive to the formation of an intermediate form that leads from the substrate to the product. Another way of saying this is that an enzyme, like any other catalyst, lowers the activation energy of a reaction.\n\nBut seriously, dude. You're asking for a course in biochemistry here. Try Stryer, or any other classic biochem textbook, for a more thorough answer."
"5","Is Intel Better or AMD ?","Can anyone tell me whether AMD computers are better or the Intel ones. I was told by somebody that even AMD Sempron does not require any additional graphic card and could play any type of game however high graphics the game may have.","The graphics built into the motherboard is what controls the graphics, not the cpu.  Having a fast processor helps, but to play games like half life 2 you would probably still need to buy a separate graphics card.  Your computer is only as fast as the weakest link so don't overspend in one area (cpu) and leave another too slow (memory or graphics).  For processor speed comparisons check out the link.

(Through personal prayer, reading the bible, worship, etc.)\n\nreferences ...\n\n""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord""\n- Romans 6:23\n\n""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith ... not by works ...""\nEphesians 2:8\n\nand many others"

A few months after the PSP was released, Sony said that their 333Mhz CPU was actually underclocked to 222Mhz for some reason unknown other than Sony. If this was a hardware cap I would just jump in and...er..regularclock it, but sadly it's not a hardware cap that's doing this, the software is. Sony still hasn't said why there's a cap on it's CPU, possibly to save battery life or to stop from overheating. Hopefully there will be some kind of flaw in a newer version of the PSP to exploit and clock the PSP to its true potential, or a game that won't underclock it just for battery life or an extra 2 degrees of heat."

Only a choice few have been known since antiquity -- usually ones that are found in their elemental state in nature or are easy to isolate from compounds (usually ores).  These are iron, copper, tin, lead, silver, gold, and mercury.  \n\nSome of the elements were discovered by people you might not consider scientists.  For example, Albertus Magnus was the first to isolate arsenic.  He was a theologian and philosopher in the 13th century, but also researched alchemy, long before true ""scientific"" methods were established -- would you count arsenic as being discovered by a scientist?  It's kind of a gray area."

Chlamydia can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal childbirth.\n\nAny sexually active person can be infected with chlamydia. The greater the number of sex partners, the greater the risk of infection. Because the cervix (opening to the uterus) of teenage girls and young women is not fully matured, they are at particularly high risk for infection if sexually active. Since chlamydia can be transmitted by oral or anal sex, men who have sex with men are also at risk for chlamydial infection."""

"2","How much does a pound of feathers weigh?","This is a tough one!","To nitpick (we all love to do that) very accurate weight measurements (for example in a lab) must be taken in a total vacuum or otherwise compensated for the bouyancy of air.  For example how much does a hot air balloon weigh?  It depends on whether it is cold on the ground or hot in the air; where it would have negative weight.

The defib, you can think of it like a jump start, for a low battery. \n\nBypass surgery is a major event for the body to handle, but coding in the care of professionals in the ICU is a far better situation, neurologically speaking, than coding in the field.

"7","where natural digits 0123456789 are coming from?","","In mathematics, a natural number is either a positive integer (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) or a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The former definition is generally used in number theory, while the latter is preferred in set theory and computer science.\n\nNatural numbers have two main purposes: they can be used for counting (""there are 3 apples on the table""), and they can be used for ordering (""this is the 3rd largest city in the country""). The natural numbers developed with some difficulty. The Peano postulates state conditions that any successful definition must satisfy. Certain constructions show that, given set theory, models of the Peano postulates must exist.\n\nPeano axioms\nThere is a natural number 0. \nEvery natural number a has a natural number successor, denoted by S(a). \nThere is no natural number whose successor is 0. \nDistinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if a ≠ b, then S(a) ≠ S(b). \nIf a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number which possesses it, then it is possessed by all natural numbers. (This postulate ensures that the proof technique of mathematical induction is valid.)"

"6","Will the Mets win their division in 2006?","","although it's no guarantee, it looks like the mets have a great shot at winning the nl east in 2006.\n\nthe 2005 standings:\n\natlanta: 90-72\nphilly:  88-74\nmets:    83-79\nflorida: 83-79\nwash:    81-81\n\nnow, washington performed well above what was expected of them, as they gave up 30 more runs than they scored.  florida has traded all of their talent for prospects.  therefore, those 2 teams are likely not going to win the division.\n\natlanta lost their leadoff batter and sparkplug rafael furcal and replaced him with edgar renteria, who was great two years ago but does not provide the same offensive or defensive weapons that furcal does.  atlanta also got a monster year out of andruw jones, who likely will not repeat that performance.  also, the braves lost their closer, kyle farnsworth, to the yankees and will likely go with chris reitsma, who was good but not great last year in limited duty.  however, the young players on the braves roster such as jeff francoeur, adam laroche, and ryan langerhans should develop further.  also, a full season of former mvp chipper jones would be helpful.  that leaves the braves with a good chance to win 90 games again.  \n\nthe phillies traded jim thome to the white sox for aaron rowand, which improves their team even though i feel they should have gotten more for thome.  with a shot at first base for a full season, ryan howard should put up some incredible numbers.  chase utley, their 2nd baseman, should also leap to stardom this year.  however, the phillies other big star, bobby abreu, wants to be traded, and that most likely means that the phils will not get full value for him.  lastly, they lost their elite closer, billy wagner, to the mets.  tom gordon, though he's old, should be a serviceable replacement, but will not be as lights-out as wagner.  unless brett myers becomes consistent and shows he can be an ace, the phillies pitching staff is comprised basically of a #2 starter, 3 #3 starters and a #4.  many teams would be happy with that pitching staff, but it doesn't win the division for you.\n\nthat leaves the mets.  the mets record last year was worse than it should have been, as they scored many more runs than they gave up.  trading for carlos delgado to replace the worst 1b positional output in the majors will be a big boost.  signing wagner to close instead of the shaky braden looper will help a lot as well, as looper blew 8 of 36 save chances.  add in the continued development of david wright, who exploded at the end of last season, and jose reyes, as well as a bounceback year for center fielder carlos beltran, and the mets look very good up and down.  paul lo duca should provide similar numbers to last year's fading mike piazza, but should also stay healthy, as the mets backup, ramon castro, is solid and should play every fourth game or so.  the mike cameron-xavier nady trade made a lot of people say ""huh?"", but it's actually good for the mets, as victor diaz has proven himself worthy of a shot to play in right field every day.  if jae seo gets a chance to start for the full season and performs like he did at the end of last season, he will be a solid #2 pitcher.  problems could include the aging of tom glavine and steve trachsel, the inconsistency of kris benson, and the lack of bullpen depth.  i'm not convinced that uber-GM omar minaya won't get his team more help in the bullpen, with rumors abound that the mets wish to sign danys baez, the devil rays all-star closer, to set up for wagner.\n\nall in all, this mets team could win 100 games and take the nl east easily."

"1","what is the significance of 786 with Islam?","","""786"" is the total value of the letters of ""Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim"". In Arabic there are two methods of arranging letters. One method is the most common method known as the alphabetical method. Here we begin with Alif, ba, ta, tha etc. The other method is known as the Abjad method or ordinal method. In this method each letter has an arithmetic value assigned to it from one to one thousand. The letters are arranged in the following order: Abjad, Hawwaz, Hutti, Kalaman, Sa'fas, Qarshat, Sakhaz, Zazagh. This arrangement was done, most probably in the 3rd century of Hijrah during the 'Abbasid period, following other Semitic languages such as Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldean etc.\n\nIf you take the numeric values of all the letters of the Basmalah, according to the Abjad order, the total will be 786. In the Indian subcontinent the Abjad numerals became quite popular. Some people, mostly in India and Pakistan, use 786 as a substitute for Bismillah. They write this number to avoid writing the name of Allah or the Qur'anic ayah on ordinary papers. This tradition is not from the time of the Prophet -peace be upon him- or his Sahabah. It developed much later, perhaps during the later 'Abbasid period. We do not know of any reputable Imams or Jurists who used this number instead of the Bismillah."

Since becoming a starter in week nine, Johnson has not failed to run for at least 107 yards and has racked up 852 rushing yards in only six games. That is an average of 142 yards a game. Extrapolated over 16 games would be 2272 yards. And it is not that he has feasted on a weak schedule with games that included DEN and @DAL. Johnson has already scored 11 touchdowns this year with ten coming in those six games as a starter. That equates to a 27 touchdown season, AKA Priest Holmes record."
"7","What is the meaning of life for a non-religous person (other than discovering a religion)?","","The meaning of life is different for everyone.  You should know, however, that discovering a religion is not mandatory - nor is it the basis for searching for the meaning of life.  For some people it is finding peace, for others it is becoming the best they can be.  It varies so much because each person is so different.  This question often goes unanswered in life to those who passively seek a solution to it.\n\nI always thought that the meaning of life was to live it fully ... I am not religious, and am not looking for a religion, but I'm happy and I think that's what the meaning of life is for me.  Living each day to the fullest.\n\nIf I had to venture a guess for most of the world - I would say the meaning of life is to have loved, and been loved as much as humanly possible with no strings attached.

"5","Can someone explain defragmentation?","","In the context of administering computer systems, defragmentation (or defragging) is a process that eliminates fragmentation in file systems. It does this by physically reorganizing the contents of the disk in order to store the pieces of each file close together and in order (contiguously). It also attempts to create large regions of free space using compaction, to impede the return of fragmentation.\n\nAims of defragmentation\nReading and writing data on a heavily fragmented hard drive is slowed down as the time for the heads to move between fragments on the disk surface can be substantial. The disk operates at speeds millions of times slower than the CPU; thus the desire to process more efficiently encourages defragmentation. Operating system manufacturers often recommend periodic defragmentation in order to keep hard drive access as fast as possible.\n\nFragmented data also spreads over more disk than it needs. Thus one may defragment in order to compact data storage before splitting a single partition into two or more partitions (for example, with GNU Parted, or PartitionMagic)."

That's not an attack, it's just an observation.  The relevance is very significant.  \n\nWith little to no experience NO certification will ""land"" you a top Microsoft job.  There is no certification out there that can replace experience.  \n\nMicrosoft has a few levels of certification.  The more prestigious is the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE).  There are some other certifications on different tracks such as a database administrator.\n\nI've been in the IT business for 6 years (not too terribly long) w/ the last 2 years being in a consultant role.  I have an MCSE in Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows 2003.  I also have my Cisco CCNP.  While these certifications certainly help my consulting firm w/ their Cisco and Microsoft partnerships, it doesn't do much for one's salary if you don't have the experience to match.  Certifications aren't difficult to come by and you get a lot of people coming into the market w/ Certs out the wazoo w/ no real experience.  \n\nSorry to rant, but I just want you to know the truth.  Don't go paying $4000, or however much, to attend a course to get an MCSE at a school because they tell you that you can land a sweet job w/ the cert.  These certification ""mills"" will fill your head full of dreams that will end up getting you burned while padding their pockets.  \n\nWith that said, if you are willing to put the money and effort into getting a certification w/ the realization that you'll have to take a few modest jobs to start out then that's a different story.  \n\nIf you're not already in the IT business then think long and hard about it before you go in.  A lot of people think that just because they like computers that they'll automatically like a job in computers.  The IT industry is very tough and fast paced.  The technology changes rapidly and to be able to make it in the field you have to keep up.  This requires a LOT of time on your part in addition to actually doing the work.  It's not for everyone.  You have to ABSOLUTELY love it and be willing to neglect the ones you love to succeed. \n\nI actually wish that someone would have told me how it is before I got into it.

What's the difference between that and them requiring an overweight person to lose weight?","This is an issue that stems back from the 1960s.\n\nAs you may or may not have known, during the 1960s, America suffered huge cultural and social changes. One of them was the rise of the Hippie Movement and Youthquake, which went against what people at the time-- especially Conservatives-- considered ""moral"", ""traditional"", and ""upstanding.""\n\nBesides the obvious sex, drugs, and rock and roll they indulged in, Hippies also dressed and changed their appearances in ways that offended Conservatives and the Establishment at the time. One of the things they did (the males) was grow out their hair and start growing beards and mustaches at a time when men were expected to be cleanshaven and have the shortest hair possible. As a result, any man who started growing his hair out became associated with the whole Hippie lifestyle and was seen as unfeminine, unAmerican, a derelict, and a subverstive.\n\nWhat you are seeing now is a holdover from those days. Many people still assume that men with long hair are in some kind of subversive lifestyle (drinking, partying, drugging, etc.). Either that, or they're just seen as stoners and slackers.

The thing is that in case you want to make money, you got to Patent. However, patenting does involve a lot of money, generally people hire attorneys to make their case strong for consideration for a patent. In case you want to make money, you will have to shed some initially, but then looking at the mass usability of your invention, you can definitely get profit. \n\nHowever, I can suggest you a better and more cheaper alternative. I am from India. As a child, I too used to frequent out in science fairs, with models on Robots to Compression Algorithms winning some commendable prizes with IBM, Infosys, Department of Science and Technology, National Geographic, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, etc. You can check them out at http://cs.dal.ca/~koul/\n\nIn government run fairs, there used to be a scheme, that all the inventions, models that have been shown, were protected by the government from copying, i.e. if someone saw an innovator's model in a fair and went home, copied the idea and went further to patent or market it, he could easily be penalized by the original innovator, through the support of your government. The government has been an earlier witness to the innovator's model and is responsile for its protection.\n\nAnother thing, you can sign a non disclosure aggrement with any party with whom you show the invention.\n\nIn case you are giving it in the public domain, I suggest you go to the appropriate officials in your country and do ask for some monetary benifits as you wish, looking at the benefit it will give to the common masses."

"3","How long does it take for AIDS to show up on a blood test?","","Three to six months from your last unsafe sexual experience is the amount of time you need to wait to get an HIV test. Depending on the source, you will get differing opinions about this ""window"" of time between infection and HIV antibody detection in a blood test. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends six months, some city and state health departments advise waiting two months, while the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), the oldest and largest HIV and AIDS service organization in the world, suggests a three-month waiting period. Alice thinks that six months is a long time to wait for HIV test results, and a negative or positive test result three months after possible HIV exposure can be considered reliable, although not 100 percent accurate."
"7","which fragrance/parfume du you prefere?","","The dreamer by Versace\n\nWhen I was younger, I had a bottle of The Dreamer and I remember it as smelling a lot like a gin and tonic being sipped by a gentleman smoking a pipe. However, I couldn't quite understand the scent in those days and only wore it a handful of times before swapping away my beautiful bottle. Now however, I can detect the white floral note, and have a greater appreciation for that warm, rich, sweet tobacco base. I only wish there was some buttery leather in there! \n\nThe opening of the juniper and lily really help temper and develop the tobacco notes, and it is this lily note that I find most intriguing (lily? in a men's scent?) as it brings a cool freshness to the edges of the fragrance. Looking at the notes, I wonder where the iris is, as it's virtually undetectable to my nose. As the scent relaxes on the skin, the tobacco mellows and merges with the amber and the almost coconut-y tarragon note becomes apparent. The final effect of this combination of notes is almost soapy...and perfect! \n\nTruly unique, and a pleasure in the cooler months, The Dreamer is perhaps the best of Versace and I now think of it as fondly as a favorite sweater or blanket - warm and comforting."

"4","the history on yellowstone national park?","","The human history of the park dates back 12,000 years. It was known to the original natives as ""Mitzi-a-dazi,"" the ""River of Yellow Rocks,"" because of the hydrothermally altered iron-containing yellow rocks in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (many people incorrectly believe that the yellow color is from sulfur).\n\nThe Native Americans that hunted and fished in the Yellowstone region also utilized the significant amounts of obsidian found in the park to make cutting tools and weapons. In fact, arrowheads made of Yellowstone obsidian have been found as far away as the Mississippi Valley, which strongly indicate that a regular obsidian trade existed between Yellowstone Native Americans and tribes further east.\n\n Lower Yellowstone FallIn 1806 a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition named John Colter left the Expedition to join a group of fur trappers and was probably the first non-Native American to visit the region and make contact with the Native Americans there. After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with Crow and Blackfoot tribes, he gave a description of a place of ""fire and brimstone"" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed ""Colter's Hell.""\n\nMountain man Jim Bridger later returned from an 1857 expedition to the park's area and told tales of boiling springs, spouting water, a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored, however, because Bridger was known for being a ""spinner of yarns."" Nonetheless his stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist F.V. Hayden who in 1859 started a two-year survey of the upper Missouri River region with Bridger as a guide and with United States Army surveyor W.F. Raynolds. The party was able to reach the approaches to the Yellowstone region but was not able to go any further due to heavy snows. The intervening American Civil War stopped all attempts to explore the region, and Hayden would not be able to fulfill his mission to explore the area for another 11 years.\n\n North Gate to Yellowstone Park at Gardiner, Montana, which says ""For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.""A party of Montanans then organized the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition, headed by the surveyor-general of Montana Henry Washburn. Amongst the group was Nathaniel P. Langford, who would later become known as ""National Park"" Langford, and an Army detachment commanded by Lt. Gustavus Doane. The expedition spent about a month in 1870 exploring the region, collecting specimens and naming sites of interest.\n\nIn 1871 Hayden led a second, larger expedition, which was now government sponsored, to the Yellowstone region. He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone which included large-format photographs by William Henry Jackson and paintings by Thomas Moran. This report helped to convince the U.S. Congress to withdraw this region from public auction. Then on March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a bill into law that created Yellowstone National Park.\n\nLangford then served for five years without pay as the first superintendent of the park and was followed by several other superintendents (who worked with some minimal funding). The second superintendent was Philetus Norris who essentially volunteered for the position, after traveling through Yellowstone and witnessing its problems first hand. During his tenure Congress finally began to give the superintendent a salary and minimal funds to operate the park. He used these monies to expand access to and further explore Yellowstone. Norris also hired Harry Yount (nicknamed ""Rocky Mountain Harry"") to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the very first national park ranger.\n\n Mammoth Hot SpringsThree additional superintendents followed, but none proved effective in stopping the destruction of Yellowstone's natural resources.\n"

"2","what is an exorcism?","","Exorcism is the religiously based act of forcing the Devil or a demon from the body of a possessed person.  This act is usually performed by a religious figure, such as a priest or shaman, and involves the performing of rituals.  Various cultures including the Greeks, Babylonians and Egyptians all had forms of what we term today as exorcism.  For instance, the Babylonian exorcism consisted of the formation and eventual destruction of a clay doll fashioned in the shape of the demon.  Supposedly, with the destruction of the doll the Devil or demon would be forced from the mortal body.  Many cultures and religions practice the act of exorcism to this day.  It is known that the current Pope of the Roman Catholic Church has participated in an exorcism although he refuses to divulge the exact details.\nExample:  William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist"
"6","where do moguls come frm on ski hills-?","","Moguls can come from a number of sources.\n\nSometinmes they form naturally when the snow falls due to the nature of the terrain (boulders, bushes and undulating ground.)\n\nSometimes they are manufactured by careful ploughing though I've never seen this in process.\n\nThe most common cause are lots of skiers and boarders turning in roughly the same points on a steep slope.  This really cuts the snow up and forms the humps, these then force people around them and the displaced snow builds them up.\n\nOne thing I have noticed over the years is that many moguls I've come across have started to change shape.  15 years ago all the moguls I remember hitting were beautifully curved mounds, I've noticed over the past few years that they seem to becoming more elongated and narrower forming a low long hump.  I think this is mainly caused by the change to carver skis which cut the snow differently to the old straight skis.  Also boarders have to take some of the blame as they really cut the surface up and seem to scrape the snow around and they tend to cut the top off of the hump as they go over them.\n\nPersonally i hate these low long humps as they are not as much fun to ski."

"2","in what form of math is x divided by 0 (you get infinity) important? And what are some practical uses of it?","","The way you asked the question, you can't do it.  However, you can do something similar, and you don't always get infinity.  If you take a number, say 5, and divide it by (positive) numbers closer and closer to zero, you will get larger and larger numbers, and you can make the answer as large as you want by making the the denominator small enough.  For this problem you say that ""the limit, as x approaches zero, of 5 divided x, is infinity.""  You might say, 5 divided by zero is infinity for short, but that it isn't exactly correct.  \n\nNow here is another problem:  What is the limit of x divided by x as x approaches zero?  In this case, the answer is always 1 unless x is equal to zero, where it is undefined. The limit, therefore, is 1 , not infinity.\n\nA very important example.  If I am travelling 60 miles per hour, what is the limit, as the time  approaches zero, of (distance travelled in miles) divided (the time travelled in hours).  The limit is 60.  This kind of problem is the essence of differential calculus, which is important in just about every science, engineering and even social science field."

Either way, it needs to be addressed immediately so that it doesn't get worse or cause him problems with his posture, back, knees, ankles.

He is mandated to protect the United States which justifies entering the war on terrorism as a response to the multiple terrorist attacks which have occurred within the United States.  However, the Patriot act has aspects which are at odds with the Constitution.\n\nAt the same time the economy is doing far better than most people understand.

Whatever you do, dont take the blame for something someone else did... make them be responsible and mature and make the right decision."

"6","What is the best way to learn skiing?","","Skiing technique is difficult to master, and accordingly there are ski schools that teach everything from the basics of turning and stopping safely to more advanced carving, racing, mogul or ""bump"" skiing and newer freestyle techniques. The venue, speed and technical difficulty associated with the sport can lead to collisions, accidents, hypothermia and other serious injury or illness, including death. Regional Ski Patrol organizations, such as the National Ski Patrol in the U.S., exist as a voluntary organization to provide guidance, help, medical assistance and emergency rescue to those in need of it.\n\nMany non-skiers wonder why skiers are willing to risk such injury. Skiers have a variety of answers to this question, but a common explanation is that it simply feels good, rather like flying, and that, when done carefully, poses no greater risk of injury compared to other sports. Of course, there is some aspect of danger, but that is part of the appeal. Skiing is the fastest means of land transport possible without mechanical assistance. Many skiers have had experiences where they have achieved a union of the mind and the body by practicing this sport; where the mind trusts the body to perform in an exceptional manner and the body trusts the mind not to lead it off an un-navigable cliff. A sense of harmony and of peak experience can result in a feeling of wholeness of self.\n\nIn addition to their role in recreation and sport, skiing is also used as a means of transport by the military, and many armies train troops for ski warfare. Ski troops played a key role in retaining Finnish independence from Russia during the Winter War, and from Germany during the Lapland War, although the use of ski troops was recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The sport of Biathlon was developed from military skiing patrols."

The United States has continued to do so even into Castro's reign, presumably because it did not want to relinquish such a strategic position, it did not want to give up the improvements it had made, and because it does not really affect Castro's power.  Castro has only cashed one rent check from the United States anyway."

If I continue the movements at 1/2 increments of my proevious move, I am still moving forward but theoretically I never reach my destination which is a fixed  point.  Is that correct? Does that mean that there are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 & 2?","What you are describing is an infinite series using a decreasing geometric progression. The sum of such a series can be described by this proof:\n\nLet T = total distance traveled (in spaces)\nThen T = 1 + (1/2) + (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16) ...\nAlso T - 1 = (1/2) + (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16) ...\nAnd if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n2*(T - 1) = 2*((1/2) + (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16) ...)\nMultiplying through:\n2T - 2 = 1 + (1/2) + (1/4) + (1/8) + (1/16) ...\nBut the Right side is the same as T!\n2T - 2 = T\nSimplifying:\nT = 2\nSo the total distance traveled is 2 spaces."
"5","Can I use non-ASCII words in Java?","For instance, use non-ASCII words as method names or variables? Any one has tried before?","Yes that is supported.

UTF-8 is the on disk encoding you usually want to use.  The default code page being used is usually a latin variant, not ASCII. This is a common misconception.  From the command line you can also use CHCP to find out what your default is.\n\nIn order to enter non localized chars into your editor you'll also need to change it's default code page and then use a IME (input method editor) to add  the non-english or french whatever you're defalt is text."

"3","what is abdominal compartment syndrome?","post AAA surgery, bypass surgery","Compartment syndrome occurs when a fixed compartment, defined by myofascial elements or bone, becomes subject to increased pressure, leading to ischemia and organ dysfunction. Well recognized to occur in the extremities, it also occurs in the abdomen, and some believe, in the intracranial cavity. The exact clinical conditions that define abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are controversial; however, organ dysfunction caused by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is considered to be ACS. The dysfunction may be respiratory insufficiency secondary to compromised tidal volumes, decreased urine output caused by falling renal perfusion, or any organ dysfunction associated with impaired perfusion."

"2","What is the roll of each astronaut in the space shuttle on departure and landing?","do all of them participate during liftoff and landing","Pilot Astronauts\n\nEarly in the U.S. manned space program, jet aircraft and engineering training were prerequisites for selection as an astronaut. Today, scientific education and experience are equally important prerequisites in selecting both pilots and mission specialists.\n\nPilot astronauts play a key role in Shuttle flights, serving as either commanders or pilots. During flights, commanders are responsible for the vehicle, the crew, mission success and safety -- duties analogous to those of the captain of a ship. Shuttle commanders are assisted by pilot astronauts who are second in command and whose primary responsibilities involve controlling and operating the Shuttle. During flights, commanders and pilots usually assist in spacecraft deployment and retrieval operations using the RMS arm or other payload-unique equipment on board the Shuttle. \n\nMission Specialist Astronauts\n\nMission specialist astronauts, working closely with the commander and pilot, are responsible for coordinating on board operations involving crew activity planning, use and monitoring of the Shuttle's consumables (fuel, water, food, etc.), and conducting experiment and payload activities. They are required to have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems and the ""operational characteristics, mission requirements and objectives and supporting systems for each of the experiments to be conducted on the assigned missions."" Mission specialists perform on-board experiments, spacewalks (called extravehicular activity (EVA) and payload handling functions involving the RMS arm. \n\nPayload Specialists\n\nThis newest category of Shuttle crew member, the payload specialist, is a professional in the physical or life sciences or a technician skilled in operating Shuttle-unique equipment. Selection of a payload specialist for a particular mission is made by the payload sponsor or customer. For NASA-sponsored spacecraft or experiments requiring a payload specialist, the specialist is nominated by an investigator working group and approved by NASA."

"2","if the earth were cubic in shape, what would happen when you walk over an edge?","","That's an interesting question.  Very little would happen that you would notice at the edge.  The center of gravity for a sphere (like the Earth) is the geometric center of the shpere and at any point on the sphere, a straight line could pass from the center of the sphere, through your feet and through your head when you are standing erect.  Because the curvature of the Earth is hard to detect where you stand, you sense that you are standing perpendicular to the ground.\n\nThe center of gravity of an Earth-sized cube would also be the geometric center of the cube.  However a cube has six sides and the very center of each side would be the only six places on the cube where you could stand erect perpendicular to the surface.  At any other point, especially as you approach an edge or corner, a straight line should pass through the center of the cube, your feet and your head, but you would be standing erect at an angle to the surface.  Right on the edge, a straight line could pass throught the center of the cube, the edge, your feet and your head as you stand erect relative to gravity.  As you step over an edge, the slope of the angle would begin to tilt the opposite way as you leave the edge toward the center of the next side.\n\nThere is an interesting point that when the British performed the original land surveys of India near Mt. Everest, the results were in error because they neglected to account for the gravitational pull of the mountain that affected perpendicularity of their plumb bob.  This effect might also create an abberation near the edges and corners of your cube.  At any rate, you would stand erect parallel to any plumb bob that you held."

"4","How many spiders do you eat in your sleep?","","It's possible, but very, very rare. Most spider wouldn't be crawling on a bed, as most house spiders like the floor (especially places that aren't disturbed very often, like the basement). Spiders also don't like to walk on moisture or in windy places. So they wouldn't be likely to go into a mouth with moisture and breathing. One other thing is that even when people are asleep, I don't know how easy it would be to swallow a spider that doesn't want to be swallowed."

Things that while you are awake you may not even be aware of.\n There are many excelllent dream dictionaries and such available through any bookstore, online and in the malls.\n Online websites are rather limited but can help with some quick analysis.\n Dream on !"
"3","how to increase job/ studies interest in Schizoprenic patients???","my son who is now 22, developed psychosis symptoms about three years back. since then he has lost interest in Studues/Job. We have tried various options . But for one reason or the other he keeps on aborting the plans.He develops anxiety, as soon as we try to finalize a plan. He has gone thru depressive phase as well. he is on 2mg respideral these days. He was prescribed various other medications in the beginning as well . Presently he is practicaly not doing anything. He also regulary visits Psychiatrist. Her overall assessment is that he is a kind of Schizophrtenic. He also addicterd on Cannabis.\nPlease advise how can we develop/incease his interest in a job/small business at least.","Tough situation as lack of motivation is a symptom of schizophrenia. It sounds as if he may have a somewhat complex symptom picture including both depression and schizophrenia symptoms. Don't know what he was like before developing symptoms of psychosis, but if he has always tended to be shy, or amotivated then schizophrenia makes these traits more pronounced.\n\nAt any rate, it may be that making the jump to a job or studies is too big a jump to make right now. It is also often difficult for you as a parent to be the one who motivates your adult child with a mental illness. I would suggest looking in your community for a community program that would involve your son in some activities that might be a precursor to job/studies. Psychosocial rehabilitation, day treatment, and other rehabilitation programs can be quite helpful. Call your local mental health association, ask your psychiatrist, or call the local mental health center for a referral to a rehabilitation program. \n\nHang in there as this is a long-term problem with which you must deal. Ideally you would like to have your child work his way to more independance, but it might be a slow journey. Get some help from people who know how to do this. You might also find out if there is a support group for parents with schizophrenic children--these groups can be very helpful in providing information and support. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill is an organization that can provide lots of assistance. Also check out the web links below."

In a BBC interview he stated that the song chronicled his experiences in mental institutions and the suicide of a friend. More recently, on the VH1 series Story Tellers, Taylor said that the song was, indeed, about Suzanne MacKenzie, a friend of his who died suddenly while he was away from home. According to that account, he had been in a deep depression after the failure of his new band ""Flying Machine"" to coalesce (the lyric includes a reference to ""sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground""; the reference is to the name of the band rather than a fatal plane crash, as was long rumored). As he was wondering what to do with himself, he received word of MacKenzie's death, and the song explains that her death was a check for his own worries, a way of realizing the transience of life and his need to get back to his old friends. In other interviews Taylor has also indicated that a battle with drug addiction figured into the song.\n\nThe song was originally written several years before its release and was refined over time; it appears probable that all the elements referenced by Taylor over time went into the final version."

"5","what is mac spoofing?","Can public and private key cryptography be useful in preventing it","A MAC address is a predefined, but still changeable, hex number address of the network card inside your computer. A spoof is when someone changes thier computers MAC address to your address and attempts to gain access to your netwrok via this mac address. Yes public and private keys can help. Authentication is the only hope you have against mac address spoofing. EXAMPLE: A wireless router that is set up for access control looks at 3 things, the mac address, the computer name and a key (128 bit or cyphered) for authentication. If someone gets a mac and computer name of a system already authenticated to join the routers network the only thing keeping this computer from accessing your router is the keys. Preferably encryted keys. If you are talking crytography that would partain to, um, what, emails and that type of thing? Unless you are trying to trace a mac addy in en email address that is. Regardless of why u are tracking the mac addy, the use of keys for authentication of whatever the source is can possibly be the last line of defence to ensure the communication is from who it says it is supposed to be. but keep in mind that if someone, other than the person or computer who is legitimently supposed to have the keys, has the computer name and mac address you can probably bet that this person has the keys as well. If you think you are beeing mac spoofed and using keys, change the keys immeditely after the threat has been detected. This is only my opinion and not gospel, but i think it to be correct. Sometimes real world assesments look very different from text book assesments and the work around is totally different as well. Final thoughts: Get a land line phone and call whomever it is u want to securely communicate with when in doubt of a security breech. I hope I was helpful."

"2","tides comes in large water bodies .why it is not coming in big lakes ?only it is coming in sea & ocean?","","In order to show a measurable effect, the water bodies have to be really large in East-West expansion. Inland seas like the Baltic Sea have little discernible Lunar tide, less than a decimetre, and much less than ""wind tides"" which can easily change one metre.\n\nTides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon. The entire water body alters its surface in reaction to the pull, on a much larger scale than the ground does. (Yes, that's true: the ground reacts to the moon by slight lifting and falling, too.)\n\nThe more east-west-distance is available, the more water will contribute to the changed equilibrium. The farther away the shore is, the deeper the new curve of the surface will intersect with sea ground level.\n\nReally high tides occur in funnel-shaped sections of the coasts where the wave is contracted from the sides."

A young man already taught boxing would find Japanese Karate easier to learn for this reason. \n\nThere are many soft styles of Martial Arts (i.e. Aikido) that are effective but by design take a very long time to master. \n\nThere is no “Best” style.

"6","Who owns the Red Sox World Series 2004 Final Out Baseball?","Does Doug Mientkiewicz or the Red Sox owners?  Afterall, Doug was an employee of the Red Sox at that time.","While the St. Louis Cardinals purchased the baseball, they gave the baseballs to Major League Baseball for use during the game. When a ball leaves the playing area, it effectively becomes abandoned property of Major League Baseball, which is why fans who catch a ball that leaves the playing area may keep it. In a similar sense, then, I think that Major League Baseball has abandoned its property when the ball ends the World Series. That ball is scuffed and cannot be used later, and it has a particular insignia that cannot be used in any other game. I think the rule of abandonment is not limited exclusively to leaving the arena, but that's debatable, and perhaps the kicker.\n\nOnce Mientkiewicz takes the ball, he possess abandoned proprety and may do as he wishes with it. He is not acting in his capacity as a player once the game is over, and the ball is his.\n\nMany claim that since Mientkiewicz was an employee of the Sox, he can't take the ball with him; they claim that it's like a mechanic taking the tools home.  In this case, however, Mientkiewicz took ABANDONED PROPERTY home.  It was more like a mechanic taking home a gallon of disposed oil, which never belonged to the employer in the first place and which had been disposed by a guest.  Therefore, it truly is Mientkiewicz's ball."

Is this normal?","Last night as I was drowsy and falling asleep, I felt as if I was becoming numb all over...and instead started to panic and jumped up again - until I was drowsy again and it started all over - until I was just too tired.","Yes this is normal. Sleep Paralysis is a common event where the mind and body start the relaxation process. When asleep the connection between the behavior of your mind and the response of your body is turned off. If it was not it is likely that you would hurt yourself as you body started acting out it's dreams. You know how when you are starting to fall asleep and you kick out or twitch in response to something you are dreaming about, same deal.\n\nIt is possible that your mind and body are not following the same pattern, that you body is shutting down before you mind can follow, or that your mind is waking before you body can follow. This is the state that is known as Sleep Paralysis. My whole family suffers from it.\n\nInterestingly, most people experience similar things when in this state. The feeling of a presence or of a pressure on your chest. A panicking feeling is also normal. People who have claimed to be abducted by aliens or visited by dead relatives have often been found to be suffering from this issue.\n\nThere are many resources online about this condition and I encourage you too look for them.

And whats primary to the Magician is actually secondary to the observer.\n\nI use to perform Magic for a living for Childrens Birthday parties,but got caught up in the financial side of it. It wasn't magic to me anymore, it was just a get rich quick scheme, and the magic was lost.\nI finally stopped myself, and quit doing it for money and now donate my magic shows to Childrens Hospitals.\n\nOnce the Magician stops believing, the audience stops believing as well. Now that I'm doing it for the right reasons, the Magic has been found."

"1","Proof Of God?","ok ok, this question will cause alot of controversy but oh well. Where is the proof of a ""god"". Where is proof of heaven, hell? It doesnt add up","This has been an oft aksed question on Y! Answers. You can see all answers at \n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=AkdeQT7qgfnFBjS2.OhiGYojzKIX?p=does+god+exist\n\nthe ones that were best are here:\n\n1. User le_penseur\n\nOk. There are a couple obvious answers that everyone gives--number 1: how can a good God exist with bad stuff happening? [I think it's interesting that people always assume that if God exists, he's good. I tend to agree with them--if God isn't good, he's just a really big version of us, right?)\nnumber 2: How can life exist without God? [that's a pro-God argument, just to clarify.] So, to deal with both answers...number one is pretty interesting. I think the answer (if one can honestly be written!) has a few parts to it. First, bad stuff happens because bad people do it. Murders require murderers. So...why does God [if he exists] allow people to do bad stuff? Or, why are bad people allowed to exist under an all-powerful God? If we assume there is a God, than the answer is a very interesting answer indeed--FREE CHOICE, under an all-powerful God. We have the right to make our lives better, or worse. With the assumption of a good God, and the evidence of a bad world, the conclusion is that we've chosen to go for the worse, and everyone suffers [but then, nobody's perfect, so everyone contributes to everyone else's suffering, too. Not a very pretty picture, but there's at least some truth in it. I'll let you decide how much.]\nAnswer number two is pretty controversial these days [most things are.] So. Can life exist without God? I've heard evolution and intelligent design theories. Many people find intelligent design insulting to their intelligence. I like an awful lot of evolution, but it just doesn't answer all of my questions. How did the eyeball manage to evolve from a series of small, random steps? Each part is dependent on the other, they don't just blossom out in complexity from a simple, functioning core structure. I'm not saying I don't believe in evolution--there's evidence it works. I just don't think it works universally. So--does that mean intelligent design is the answer? Hm...not necessarily. A lack of knowledge is not proof of impossibility. But I wouldn't rule it out. Does intelligent design, or--dare I say it--guided evolution, prove the existence of God? I wouldn't say it proves the existence of God. I would say it presents some very interesting questions. Ultimately, everyone really does have to decide for themselves. Scientifically, the Universe is a big place with a lot of unanswered, and possibly unanswerable, questions. God is an awfully big explanation. Spiritually, from the point of assuming God exists, what God asks for is Faith. He says so in the Bible (yes, I'm operating from an incriminatingly Western view point. Cut me some slack.) So, you've got to decide for yourself. You probably guessed this already, but yes, I believe in God. A friend of mine suggested that what improved my life and what I prayed to was really the better side of me that I didn't believe existed and therefore projected as God. I found the idea rather interesting and talked it over with God a few times before deciding He really was God, but like I said--a lot of these things really tie into faith. Thank you for a VERY interesting question, and I'm sorry for a VERY long answer. Tell me what you think. \n\n2.User Soham\n\nIt's seem to be a interesting question. Personaly, I think GOD exist. When Newton gave the law of gravational force or other astrnomy laws. Neither he nor we saw the graviational force but we feel the effect of gravitational force. If the certain things does not see it doesn't mean that this things doesn't exit. As we know that in our environment water molecules are exist but we cannot see.

"7","how does computer clock works even if computer is off??","help !!","Most computers have a small battery. In many cases, the battery is soldered directly onto the motherboard, but the battery is usually in some sort of holder so it is easy to replace. Computers are not the only things that have a small battery like this -- camcorders and digital cameras often have them, too. Just about any gadget that keeps track of the time will have a battery.\n\nIn your computer (as well as other gadgets), the battery powers a chip called the Real Time Clock (RTC) chip. The RTC is essentially a quartz watch that runs all the time, whether or not the computer has power. The battery powers this clock. When the computer boots up, part of the process is to query the RTC to get the correct time and date. A little quartz clock like this might run for five to seven years off of a small battery. Then it is time to replace the battery."
"4","Should Evolution be taught in schools?","","Yes, evolution should be taught in schools, but it should be presented as a scientific theory that is most widely accepted, not as a solid fact that cannot be questioned.  I also think that creationism, which is also a theory that is commonly accepted, but is also something that cannot be scientifically proven at this point, should also be taught in schools.\n\nThe problem is that the scientific community is extremely defensive about losing respect for the theory of evolution, because it is still such a young theory, that they are not being respectful to the idea that part of science includes questioning theories.\n\nReligious scholars also tend to be too strict, not considering, perhaps, that evolution could be guided by God, or that evolutionary patterns may have been put into place at some starting point that was already evolved.  This is similar to claiming that the chicken came before the egg, but the chicken continued to evolve after it existed.\n\nChildren should be required to consider several viewpoints, just as they are in other aspects of education."

"1","Reunion parties – why do we do that to ourselves?","","It does seem to be a form of torture, doesn't it?  I think there's a part of all of us that in some small way wants to connect with our past and our youth, regardless of what it was like for us then.  If it was good (star athelete, class president), it's another moment basking in that spotlight of old.  If the experience was bad, it's always tempting to return to those people who made your life terrible to see if they have fallen from grace as far as you imagined they might. Then of course there's you--how much have you changed, for better or worse, and how you imagine that will affect that same group of people you loved/hated all those years ago.  It's a wonder more people don't end up in therapy before and/or after attending one.  As for me, I've been to just one--and while I had a pretty good time, I really doubt I'll be tortuing myself again."

It was painful, but I learned how to survive. It is a really good idea to get a ""study buddy"" who, sorry to be rude, but is at least as smart as you or smarter. If its a retard, you'll end up spending your study time on things you already understand. Read the text and any notes the prof gives you before class so you at least know some of the terms. Then, as soon as possible after class, do review questions from the book so that the concepts really settle in. And, before the exam, get together a really good study group, sit in someone's dorm with some pizza and coffee and study, study, study...you'll feel more confident if you're prepared! Good luck."

The English word ""pound"" comes from ""pondo,"" and the abbreviation ""lb."" comes from ""libra."" When you are referring to more than one pound, an ""s"" is added to the abbreviation to make it plural, so it becomes ""lbs."""

For example, enter in a name of a sports team (in season) on different search engines and you'll see a good example of what I mean.\n\nDo they have too many programmers/engineers and not enough true, touchy/feely UI designers? Does Google plan to just live off their brand now?\n\nConcerned Google stockholder.","In my opinion, Google was never something more than a great search engine. In an early era where dial-up was more common than broadband, Google built a top-notch engine with a very light UI which made it an immediate favorite amongst a lot of users. What was nice about Google was that it never aspired to be something someone else was, it created its own identity as a very comprehensive search engine. However, offlate, I have started losing faith in Google, especially because their objectives and goals as a company seem very unclear. A chunk of their revenue still comes through ads, and their search engine is really the only intellectual property they have developed from the ground-up, otherwise everything else is either just an acquisition or a bad idea. Google earth was previously keynote, Google Talk has been built upon Jabber which is an open source technology for messaging and these were the ""other"" great ideas besides the search engine, but things like web accelerators and secure connection through VPN are just lame excuses to drive internet traffic through their servers.\n\nAnother great idea from Google was desktop search, but somehow they never capitalized on the idea, and today MSN has come out tops in this department.\n\nAt the end of the day, Google isnt running out of ideas, I think they are running out of focus, something that companies like Yahoo have and very well defined ones at that."

"3","I suffer from Erectile Dysfunction. Dr claimed it as BOTH physical, but more psychological. Any suggestions ?","I suffer from Bipolar Disorder, the Mixed episode and this has some effect. The Dr. diagnosed the reason to be both physical (Prostate troubles) \nand to a much greater extent,psychological.\nProblems include premature ejaculation as well. Although I take Zoloft Antidepressant which has effect on ejaculation, still I ejaculate very rapidly. Viagra, Cialis and Levitra do help to some extent, but do not produce the desired outcome.\nThey have no effect on the fast ejaculation problem. \nI and my partner failed to tolerate to Vacium devices. Pennis Injections do work but they induce pain and have harmful side effects on the long range.","Prostate problems can cause major erectile problems, and even problems with ejaculation. And if you are taking meds for bipolar disorder, those almost always cause problems with ejaculation, but not necessarily with erectile function.  You are not in the best of situations, because viagra would probably work well without the bipolar meds. The best course of action is a patient, willing, and caring partner, even if the sex is marginal because of your situation, and understanding and caring partner can help make it very good. A good psychological state and situation can make up for the physical problems - it won't really do much of anything to fix the physical problems, but it can make intimacy more enjoyable. Get creative, and be satisfied with what you've got. A selfish or non-understanding partner would probably not only be extremely stressful and unfulfilling, but probably would tell you a whole lot about them. The most ironic thing is that sexual dysfunction is severly underrearched and not understood very well - particularly physical causes. Until the more recent decades it was almost always assumed to be purely psychological."

Republicans are the party of the wealthy, everything they do benefits the wealthy while the middle class and the poorest people suffer.","The days of the working class democrat are gone my friend. The Kennedy's and Rooservelts are long gone. The democrats now are not concerned about the working class. They are more concerned with dividing classes in this counrty. Look at the issues that effect you everyday and tell me what a democrat has done for you lately. They are more concerned with promising the world to the poor and to minorities. They like to bring race and ethniticity into their issues, when in reality they don't want to bring people together and have everyone be equal, it takes away their base. It's a proven fact that young people, minorities and the poor are the base voters for democrats. The democrats promise to bring new hope to these people, but they don't do anything for them. They try to bring race and class warfare into everything. Once most young people get older they switch their beliefs and begin to become conservative. When minorities and immigrants get good jobs and start businesses they become conservative. The democrats have nothing to offer working class people. I live in a very liberal state and we have elected republican governors for the last 5 years. We went from a 4.5 billion dollar defecit to having a 500 million dollar surplus without doing the old democratic action of raising taxes. I am middle class. My family household income is only $40,000 ( to some democrats I'm in the top 10%) The democrats have done nothing for me. I have the heaviest tax burden, my kids won't get any aid for college, I don't have any laws that place me at the head of the line for a job. Please let me know what a democrat has done for you lately. There aren't many working class democrats out there anymore. Last one I can think of that really cares about the common man is Sen Joe Liberman. The democratic party doesn't care about defending our country. If they had thier way we would sit back let people attack us and fire a missile into an abandoned camp in the Sudan and say ""we're even"". They are more concerned about the rights of our enemies than the people of this nation. Listening to people like Howard Dean and John Kerry would make me embarressed to be a democrat. The democrats are the most negative party I have seen, they feast on dividing this nation. Ever since the 2000 election they have been out to ruin Bush. Is Bush a great president? He's not the greatest, but far, far from the worst. The democrats will sit back and say that Bush lied about WMD's in Iraq, but fail to remember that for 8 years, Clinton, Gore, Albright, Cohen all made the same claims and talked about how Iraq possesing WMD's was the most dangerous situation in the world. How soon we forget, because we have to attack the president for political gains. So far it isn't working so good. Please tell me what president has gone through what Bush has gone through. In his first 5 years in office. Our country was attacked. The worse attack by a foreign entity in our history. We found that there are thousand of Islamic extremist living in this country and they want to kill us. The threat of the next attack could be tem times worse then what 9/11 brought. We have gone to war in Afghanastan, Iraq, and countless other places we don;t even know about to fight terroism. We have an extremist movement in this world that is very strong that wants to destroy the way of life of the western world. Not just America, the Western World!!. They will stop at nothing to do so. Bush has had to deal with countless natural disasters that we have never experienced before in such great frequency. He has had to deal with the greatest divide this country has seen since the Civil War. He was handed a downward spiral economy that we found was over inflated in the 90's by greedy companies that were cooking the books, and the economy was only made worse by the 9/11 attacks."

"5","can u create a ""CON"" folder in winxp and how to reset or findout the password in winxp?","","The basic problem is that CON is the built in name used for a standard I/O port representing ""console"". This is just like other ports, like LPT1, LPT2, COM1, COM2, etc. If you managed to created such a file/folder on your machine, all normal input and output that normally come from the keyboard and display on the screen would have to come from and go to the file/folder you created.\n\nDOS device names are reserved words, and cannot be\nused as folder or file names. When parsing a reference to a file or folder, Windows correctly checks for the case in which a single DOS device name is used in the path, and treats it as invalid.\n\nfollowing are reserved device names\n\nCON, PRN, AUX, CLOCK$, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4,\nCOM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4,LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.\n\nu cannot create a folder or file of the above names.\n\nThis actually is a unix-like feature. DOS device drivers are accessible like normal files, i.e. the everything-is-a-file philosophy. CON is the equivalent of /dev/tty, NUL of /dev/null, COM# of /dev/ttyS#, LPT# of /dev/lp# and CLOCK$ corresponds to /dev/rtc (PRN is an alias to LPT1, AUX is COM1). Every character device can be opened this way, block devices (which are assumed to be FAT formatted...) are named A: to Z:, as you will know. Many pseudo character devices (drivers which had to be loaded as drivers but were no character devices, like EMM386, HIMEM.SYS, ..) had forbidden characters like '*' in their device names to be hidden from the user.\n\nThe only problem is: DOS 1, which introduced CON, NUL, PRN and AUX had no directories, i.e. no /dev/, so for compatibility with old DOS1-executables (which don't know that they live in a directory) the character devices have to exist in every directory. Don't know why this feature was not limited to FCB (CP/M like) file access, unix like file numbers were introduced together with directories in DOS 2 (actually the MS programmers had Xenix machines on their desks, I heard)..\n\nsecondly i would say that some extra smart people try to create the Folder ""con"" by using special characters in front of the folder name such as now take for example one of my friend told me that he had created the folder ""con"". he showed me the syntax. the correct syntax for creating a folder in DOS is...\n\nmkdir con \n\nbut since the folder ""con"" cannot be created this command doesnt execute.\nnow see the syntax what my friend showed me\n\nmkdir &#92;.&#92;&#92;d:&#92;con  (warning : dont try on ur pc)\nand to delete the folder is\nrd &#92;.&#92;&#92;d:&#92;con\nu know wat will happen\nin windows xp u will c only a folder of name ""con"" but  the actual name is &#92;.&#92;&#92;con\nwe should not use special character in front of folder names.\n\nThere is one more technique to create ""con"" but it is not known to most of the people.\nThis is the alt+255 technique.\nIn this the user holds the ""alt"" key and then presses 255 from the numpad before or after the folder name.\nBut alt + 255 is the keyboard combination of underscore(_) or space which is a special character and hence can't be used for folder name.\nWhile displaying the name it wont show the special character, it will show only the name ""con""\n\nNow regarding the file ""con""\nyou may not have noticed but it is not only the folder ""con"" cannot be created but also u cannot create a file of name ""con"" (such as u can't create ""con.txt"",\n""con.doc"",""con.ppt"" etc...)\nThe reason for this is as follows\n\nIn Dos there are two commands \nfor creating a file we use a command ""copy con""\nthe syntax for creating a file in DOS is..\n\ncopy con <filename>\n\nusing the above command u can create a file in DOS.\nnow for copyng a file the command is ""copy"" in Dos\nthe synatx is ..\n\ncopy <filename1> <filename2&gt"

"2","why is the sky blue?","","The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859. He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red. This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in. From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank. The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later. He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles. It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.\n\nDust or Molecules?\nTyndall and Rayleigh thought that the blue colour of the sky must be due to small particles of dust and droplets of water vapour in the atmosphere. Even today, people sometimes incorrectly say that this is the case. Later scientists realised that if this were true, there would be more variation of sky colour with humidity or haze conditions than was actually observed, so they supposed correctly that the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the air are sufficient to account for the scattering. The case was finally settled by Einstein in 1911, who calculated the detailed formula for the scattering of light from molecules; and this was found to be in agreement with experiment. He was even able to use the calculation as a further verification of Avogadro's number when compared with observation. The molecules are able to scatter light because the electromagnetic field of the light waves induces electric dipole moments in the molecules.\n\nWhy not violet?\nIf shorter wavelengths are scattered most strongly, then there is a puzzle as to why the sky does not appear violet, the colour with the shortest visible wavelength. The spectrum of light emission from the sun is not constant at all wavelengths, and additionally is absorbed by the high atmosphere, so there is less violet in the light. Our eyes are also less sensitive to violet. That's part of the answer; yet a rainbow shows that there remains a significant amount of visible light coloured indigo and violet beyond the blue. The rest of the answer to this puzzle lies in the way our vision works. We have three types of colour receptors, or cones, in our retina. They are called red, blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths. As they are stimulated in different proportions, our visual system constructs the colours we see.\n\n\nResponse curves for the three types of cone in the human eye\n\nWhen we look up at the sky, the red cones respond to the small amount of scattered red light, but also less strongly to orange and yellow wavelengths. The green cones respond to yellow and the more strongly-scattered green and green-blue wavelengths. The blue cones are stimulated by colours near blue wavelengths which are very strongly scattered. If there were no indigo and violet in the spectrum, the sky would appear blue with a slight green tinge. However, the most strongly scattered indigo and violet wavelengths stimulate the red cones slightly as well as the blue, which is why these colours appear blue with an added red tinge. The net effect is that the red and green cones are stimulated about equally by the light from the sky, while the blue is stimulated more strongly. This combination accounts for the pale sky blue colour. It may not be a coincidence that our vision is adjusted to see the sky as a pure hue. We have evol"

You can use Group Policy or the Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) to set security zones and privacy settings. If you are using Group Policy or IEAK on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, you may have to install several hotfixes to set security zones and privacy settings.\n\n\nIf the Security Zones: Use only machine settings setting in Group Policy is enabled, or if the Security_HKLM_only DWORD value is present and has a value of 1 in the following registry key, only local computer settings are used and all users have the same security settings: \nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;Software&#92;Policies&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;Internet Settings\nWith the Security_HKLM_only policy enabled, HKLM values will be used by Internet Explorer, but the HKCU values will still be displayed in the zone settings on the Security tab in Internet Explorer. This is by design and there are no plans to change this functionality.\n\nIf the Security Zones: Use only machine settings setting is not enabled in Group Policy, or if the Security_HKLM_only DWORD value does not exist or is set to 0, computer settings are used along with user settings. However, only user settings appear in the Internet Options. For example, when this DWORD value does not exist or is set to 0, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE settings are read along with HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings, but only HKEY_CURRENT_USER settings appear in the Internet Options.\nNote With the Security_HKLM_only policy enabled, HKLM values will be used by Internet Explorer, but the HKCU values will still be displayed in the zone setting tab within the Internet Explorer Interface. This is by design, and there are no plans to change this functionality at this time. \nTemplatePolicies\nThe TemplatePolicies key determines the settings of the default security zone levels (Low, Medium Low, Medium, and High). You can change the security level settings from the default settings. However, you cannot add additional security levels. The keys contain values that determine the setting for the security zone. Each key contains a Description string value and a Display Name string value that determine the text that appears on the Security tab for each security level. \nZoneMap\nThe ZoneMap key contains the following keys: • Domains \n• ProtocolDefaults \n• Ranges \nThe Domains key contains domains and protocols that have been added to change their behavior from the default behavior. When a domain is added, a key is added to the Domains key. Subdomains appear as keys under the domain where they belong. Each key that lists a domain contains a DWORD with a value name of the affected protocol. The value of the DWORD is the same as the numeric value of the security zone where the domain is added.\n\nThe ProtocolDefaults key specifies the default security zone that is used for a particular protocol (ftp, http, https). To change the default setting, you can either add a protocol to a security zone by clicking Add Sites on the Security tab, or you can add a DWORD value under the Domains key. The name of the DWORD value must match the protocol name, and it must not contain any colons (:) or slashes (/). \n\nThe ProtocolDefaults key also contains DWORD values that specify the default security zones where a protocol is used. You cannot use the controls on the Security tab to change these values. This setting is used when a particular Web site does not fall in a security zone. \n\nThe Ranges key contains ranges of TCP/IP addresses. Each TCP/IP range that you specify appears in an arbitrarily named key. This key contains a string value (:Range) that contains the specified TCP/IP range. For each protocol, a DWORD value is added that contains the numeric value of the security zone for the specified IP range. \n\nWhen the Urlmon.dll file uses the MapUrlToZone public function to re"

It is a process of wear and tear that occurs with ageing in virtually all individuals. It is also referred to as osteoarthritis, arthrosis and spinal arthritis. The joint surface may become eroded and the gristle or cartilage that lines the joint is no longer smooth but pitted. This results in pain and inflammation occurring with movement. In addition to this there is a process of thickening in the ligaments around the joints as well, a gradual deformity of the joint itself rather like the end of a stick that has been hit with a mallet. The result is a splaying out of the joint surface and this edge of bone (osteophytes) causes a characteristic appearance with apparent swelling and enlargement of the joint itself. In addition to these changes, the joint may become inflamed with redness heat and swelling with accompanying pain. Typically the inflammation comes on overnight once the joint is rested and gradually wears off as the joint gets moving."

The back door region in general has many nerve endings and is ultra sensitive to stimulation. Some people can enjoy just tickling it, fingering it, and others desire full insertion. It also depends on if the guy does not know what he is doing too. All a person needs is a bad experience to ruin things for a lifetime.

"4","Why it is so vital that the remembrance, history and lessons of the Holocaust be passed to a new generation?","Suggest what they, as students, can do to combat and prevent prejudice, discrimination and violence in our world today.","Arguably the answer to that question is: ""to prevent similar incidents from happening again"".\n\nHowever, similar incidents did happen, and will happen as long as the scope of the event is limited to a single specific case which has an article and a special name for it: ""The Holocaust""\n\nNo matter how painful and unforgettable the events of the Holocaust may be, it is -one- of the genocides that happened in this century, if not in the known human history. However one always has to keep a sense of proportion. Proportionately, the genocide of the jewish population in Europe somehow becomes the only genocide that warrants mass publication, exposure. Ultimately the Holocaust itself becomes the specific case of the crimes against jews, and anti semitism, rather than the crimes against humanity and fascism.\n\nMeanwhile the Armenian genocide, Genocide in Rwanda, the genocide against Gypsies and such other events receive very few and limited exposure.\n\nWhat the new generations learn from the Holocaust as it is presented today is limited to the simple moral: antisemitism is bad. But the genocide of the Jews was not made possible through antisemitism but through fascism, through disregard for human life. \n\nFor that reason even only 10 years ago the genocide in Rwanda went relatively unnoticed.\n\nGuess the Tutsi's weren't human enough."

It's just a tool.\n\nI was once a sarcastic person who was unaware why.  I simply thought it was cleverness.  \n\nWhen someone used sarcasm on me, it hurt enough that I looked at myself and discovered why I was doing it and stopped - just like that.  It's been years and I've never reverted to sarcasm since then."

Because the newly synthesized DNA strands can subsequently serve as additional templates for the same primer sequences, successive rounds of primer annealing, strand elongation, and dissociation produce rapid and highly specific amplification of the desired sequence. PCR also can be used to detect the existence of the defined sequence in a DNA sample."

You don't know the guy and there's only so much you can know in a few days.\nTo discover something bad, disgusting, improper, unsatisfying, or unacceptable after marriage will only have you stuck with this person carrying that on your shoulders even if it's unbearable for you, for the rest of your life.\nTo take that gamble means that you could end up with a good guy, or end up with a horribly bad guy who doesn't do his duties but expects you to do yours perfectly.\nIt's something you don't want to gamble your life on, and it would be unfair to your kids because if you fail this gamble badly you'll be stuck in a bad marriage and yours kids will suffer with a dodgy or bad father figure.\nI think a love marriage is easier to cope with, and in the end you can tell your kids and yourself you married him because you loved him, not because he was chosen for you.\n\nWhatever the case, don't rush and choose wisely. Good luck!"
"7","what are day light savings?","","From wikipedia:\n""Daylight saving time (also called DST) is the North American term for a system intended to ""save"" daylight (the British observe summer time, and likewise the Europeans). The official time is adjusted forward, (usually) one hour from its official standard time, remaining that way for the duration of the spring and summer months. This is intended to provide a better match between the hours of daylight and the active hours of work and school.""\n\nIn my own wordings, it's adjusting time in summer/winter so you won't be going to school/work when it's dark, or waking up at 6am and the sun is too high in the sky.\nCountries usually adjust the time to make the change between summer/winter in sunrise/sunset easier on people."
"9","Would I go to hell if I become a lesbian!?","","You won't go to hell just for being a lesbian.\n\nNowhere in the bible does it mention lesbianism is wrong. There are passages that possibly refer to gay men (depending on the translation one reads) but none of them refer to women.\n\nConservative religious zealots only refer to sections of the bible that they find serve their needs anyway. Examples of commonly ignored scripture:\n   How many houses of these people have parapets? (Deuteronomy 22:8)\n   How many wear clothing of mixed fabrics? (Leviticus 19:19)\n   How many adulterers are stoned to death? (Deuteronomy 22:22)\n   How many trim their beards? (Leviticus 19:27)\n\n\nSo, if you are devout, know that just by being a lesbian, you won't go to hell. If you are attracted to women, be true to yourself."

"1","what are the sign's of a person that is gay and doesnt want anyone to know it.?","","Well, if you catch them engaged in a sexual act with a person of their same gender then that would be a good sign. \nI almost cringe to even answer that question because I do want to perpetuate stereotypes of homosexual people and I do not want people to think that there are real ""signs"" of being gay as though gay people are so different. Bottom line, it's probably none of your business. If you are a family member or are concerned for a friend's emotional wellbeing then maybe you could ask them. But if they are not ""out"" then you should not tell. Sexuality is a very personal thing and having a sexuality that is different or considered ""wrong"" by  mainstream society or that person's family can be especially painful. Again if you are a family member or a concerned friend then offer a sympathetic ear and your ability to be sensitive and keep a secret. Otherwise, concern yourself with  more pressing matters.\n\nRemember when addressing this that any sexual prefernce is not chosen. People are born with it. And even if people believe it is a matter of environment and not a matter of biology then know that it is still out of that person's hands. Please remember to be kind and understanding of all people and their sexual orientations."

We are fighting so that these fanatical terrorists do not enter the sacred ground of our country and we have to fight them in our own backyard."

"9","Should I fight for my marriage after adultery or should I file for divorce?","","Such a difficult question!  I ought to know.  This is the situation I am in.  I have filed.  In my case, this was not just one offense.  Even though this was the first ""technical"" adultery, i.e. the first in-flesh fornication (that I know of!), there have been years of infidelity in one form or another, e.g. viewing of pornography, visiting strip clubs, socializing with women w/out me.  I found out about all these things very much after the fact, as I was lied to for many years, beginning during our courtship.  There was much emotional and psychological abuse.  He has no respect for me.  I hung in there all this time and worked my hardest to make things better, including making him go to marriage counseling, because I personally believed it was my duty due to the covenant I had made with God.  ...but this for me was the last straw, and by God's merciful permissive will, this choice is provided for in scripture.  I hope you have not suffered in this way, but if you have....as excruciating as I know it is....have courage to leave him.  Maintain your self-respect while you still can.  Hold him accountable for his actions, once and for all.  If he truly changes and becomes a reformed person, it will become obvious, and perhaps you can one day reconcile.  If he doesn't...well, then, you are better off.  Now, if on the off chance that you have had a very healthy marriage and this was, as far as you know, a single transgression (...rather than a relationship or multiple cases of adultery.  In my husband's case..this was a six month emotional attachment and relationship, involving much debauchery, too), it would of course be desireable to God if you could reconcile, particularly if there are children involved.  ..but seek wise counsel.  His true remorse and commitment to real change is imperative.  Either way, seek counsel for yourself.  The trust that has been breached will take years to rebuild.  Above all, be good to yourself.  There is NO excuse for his choice.  God bless..and be strong."

I am only 14 and cant let my life get worse day by day! plz help me ppl!! I beg u!~~","Please start by seeing a doctor.  If your family has good insurance (or Medicaid -- most states covers kids above the poverty level), I would start with an allergist or a pulmonologist.  If you lack insurance, there are often community clinics where you can go for treatment.\n\nAsthma is a chronic disease that isn't really cured but can often be very effectively controlled.  Poor control causes many issues (and you know that!) and can even be life threatening.\n\nHow is it managed?  The first step is to try and figure out what causes your asthma.  This can often be an allergy (although asthma can also be triggered by other things such as cold air and exercise).  Regardless of the trigger, a doctor will work with you to reduce that trigger.  (In the case of allergies, this can involve everything from covering the mattress if the allergy is to dust to nasal sprays to allergy shots to limiting your exposure to certain things).\n\nThe doctor may also prescribe a slower acting medicine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.  This most often an inhaler but could also be a pill.  And this is important:  asthma seems to sort of feed on itself and treatment can help reduce the inflamation.  Also important is to understand that this will not stop an astma attack that you justt started having -- it takes days to have an impact.\n\nIn addition, a doctor may presecribe a fast acting inhaler (often called a rescue inhaler).  This is designed to be used to treat a current astma attack.\n\nSo the plan:  a) reduce the triggers that cause the asthma; b) longer term medication to help soothe the inflamation and reduce the severity/frequemcy; and c) a rescue inhaler when a and b fail.  If you find yourself using the rescue inhaler often, contact your doctor as the first two steps probably need refined.\n\nMake sense? Good luck!"
"1","Do you ever see something that can proof that there is a life after death?","I mean, you ever see an Angel, ghost, or something like that. Not just from read from Bible, book, etc.","No -- but I tried to test it.  I had a friend who was dying of terminal cancer, and she was very religious and wasn't very scared.  So I bought a combination lock and asked her to set the combination but not tell me.  Then, I asked her to do everything in her power to come tell me the combination to unlock it once she had died.   If the combination worked, then I'd know it wasn't a dream that I made up.  She promised that she would do everything she could do get a message to me, because she loved me as a friend and wanted to bring hope to my life.\n\nAnyway, this was 2 years ago.  Nothing.  If there was life after death and the dead could communicate with us, I know for certain that Jen would have sacrificed a lot to get a message to me."

"4","What is a post-masters graduate certificate?","I have found a school that offers a post-masters graduate certificate.  They say it is almost as good as a PHD.  Any suggestions","The post-masters graduate certificate is a degree level that is intermediate between the masters degree and the doctorate. It became popular in education careers where promotions or job grades depended in part on educational level. They recognized this ""sixth year"" degree level as one year of study beyond the master's degree. You also sometimes see it referred to as a ""specialist's"" degree because some of the early post-masters degrees were Educational Specialist (Ed.S.) degrees. Other common names are Certificate of Advanced Study or Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study. \n\nThe utility of the post-masters certificate depends on what field you are in and why you want the degree. Some fields of study have the specialist level as the entering level for certification or licensure (school psychology, for example), in which case you would find it vital. Some fields (counseling, for example) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level (60 semester hours) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed. Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate (i.e. Infant Mental Health Nursing) in which case the certificate is very useful. On the other hand, some fields really require a doctorate (most college teaching, for example) in which case the post-masters certificate, while good to have, won't fulfil the occupational requirement.\n\nI think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest, and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.\n\nHope this helps."
"7","Why do you wear sunglasses ??","","first of all to look cool.\n\nHiding one's eyes has implications in face-to-face communication: It can hide weeping, being one of the signs of mourning, makes eye contact impossible which can be intimidating, as in the stereotype of the guardian of a chain gang, or can show detachedness, which is considered cool in some circles. Many cultures do not take them kindly. Darkened sunglasses of particular shapes may be in vogue as a fashion accessory. Note that normal glasses are very rarely worn without a practical purpose. Curiously, they can project an image of uncool nerdiness that sunglasses do not have. The impact on nonverbal communication and the cool image can be the reasons for wearing sunglasses by night or indoors. People also wear sunglasses when they don't want others to see that they're high by looking at their bloodshot eyes.\nEyeglasses improve visual comfort. Various types of disposable sunglasses are dispensed to patients after receiving mydriatic eye drops during eye examinations\nIt is important that the makers of one's sunglasses ensure that the glasses protect against UV (ultraviolet) rays. In the European Union, a CE mark () identifies glasses fulfilling quality regulations. In the preparation for solar eclipses, health authorities often warn against looking at the sun through only sunglasses."

Immigrants, illegals too, are coming here for a purpose for which anyone in their shoes would try to come. At the base, it is survival. Potentially, it's opportunity to make life better for themselves and those they love. Seems to me that we, the US of A, should see that as a compliment.\n\nSeems like the USA, could combine all of its creative wits and develop a way to use all this energy more productively and peacefully both long and short range.\n\nI say offer a handshake, rather than a wall, at the borders. Sign up the immigrants. Let them participate in the work force. Let them seek education. Let them participate in the economy. We're not talking citizenship yet. We're talking about letting people earn a responsibile living. Before allowing them to receive government welfare type aid, require them to become citizens first. If they wish to pursue citizenship, ok, let em do so. If not, let em return to their countries of origin or wherever.\n\nOf course, we should continue to exercise our concerns about drug trafficking and terrorist plots. But, gee! Should it be sooooo difficult to get into the USA to work, visit friends, and visit family."

What is the purpose of the business, who are the customers, how will the business make money, what are the competitive markets? Develop the strategic plans, marketing plans, and financial plans. Determine the breakeven points and the profitable timelines. Establish the critical paths and associated timelines. In all of that you will uncover the guidelines that will provide your startup with a better than average chance of success.\n\nAside from the necessity of planning there are many legal concerns you must be ready to face. How will you protect your customers from fraudulent clicks? How will you prove in court if necessary, that the charges to your client are true “human” clicks from legitimate customers? You will want to establish a corporate structure to protect your personal property from the inevitable lawsuits and court cases these businesses are currently plagued with. Developing the software, establishing reliable hosting services, managing the billing and merchant accounts are all relatively easy from here."

"2","What is downcutting?","","Downcutting Failures - cumulative process at the toe of the structure \n\nLake bed downcutting is another common mode of failure for existing shoreline protection structures and it is sensitive to water levels. For example, if lake levels are low and the waterline is offshore of the structure toe, downcutting will not occur. Conversely, if the water levels are very high, the majority of the wave energy will be dissipated on the structure face or will overtop the structure. Therefore, the amount of downcutting is very sensitive to lake levels. The picture at right, taken in the County of Prince Edward, Ontario, visually demonstrates the downcutting process. The concrete block wall was constructed directly on the shale lake bed. Over time, downcutting has eroded the shale at the structure toe and will eventually undermine the wall leading to a failure."

Here's a number of pointers from a registered sleep tech:\n\nEstablish a good routine for you sleep schedule:\nbed at same time, wake at same time sort of business. Don't let weekend get you out of whack.\n\nGet a full 8 hours of sleep. Although, many need somewhat more or less than that based on age and individual differences....8's a good average to start with.\n\nNo caffeine for 6-8 hours prior to bed\n\nDo not work out 1-2 hours prior to bed\n\nNo TV or reading in bed (train to body to only sleep in bed, well and other necessary activities with one's mate)\n\nIf you have difficulty sleeping due to thinking too much about...well anything that keeps you up....things to do etc.  Try to write everything down that you will be doing for the next day before bed so that you won't need to think about it in bed.\n\nIf you are sensitive to noise, try earplugs, or blindfold if having light issues.\n\nStress can always add to the problem, try to relax!  \n\nOK, now the really important stuff...as many mentioned...this could be a health issue. The most common problem (and often undiagnosed) for being tired all the time is obstructive sleep apnea. This is the bread and butter of the sleep field in general. No way I could tell you without a complete history, a couple dozen wires and a few hours, if this is the problem. Go to a sleep lab, they are everywhere, doesn't hurt to have a test run eh. However, here's a few things to red flag ya:\n\nAre you tired all the time...clearly yes\nAre you at all overweight.\nDo you have a 15"" neck or larger.\nDo you snore.\nDo you wake up with dry mouth or headaches.\nDo you or anyone in your family have any history of heart problems, particularly Congestive Heart Failure.\nDoes anyone in your family snore or have Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\nDo you get up to go to the bathroom several times a night.\nForgetfullness\nImpotence\nummmm....I'm sure I've left a few things off....anywho...\n\n\nIf anything on this list pops out, and even if they don't for that matter, go have a test at your local sleep lab.\n\nOn a more rare note, there is other sleep disorders that could make you tired all the time....say narcolepsy, insomnia, parasomnias, periodic leg movements, etc.  Everything can be evaluated at a sleep disorders center, generally one doctor referal away. \n\nGood luck!"

I've been determined that this is ,atleast,a relavent notion ever since my 7th grade teacher sent me to the office for mentioning it. I am now 26 yrs old. even considering the decomposition process into the equasion it makes sense that the earth would be getting bigger. right? Think about all of our dumps and about the extra square footage that a coffin is left with negative space.","Why would earth be growing because of people and trees? Everything that life is made up of comes from earth and when we die goes back to it. Material is not born from thin air. All living things primarily are hydrocarbons.- we are made up of Carbon, Hydrogen, oxygen etc everything comes from the plants/animals we eat. Plants are made up of what they absorb from earth. A trees over the years through photosynthesis converts all the carbon dioxide it takes and water it absorbs into itself. It is made up of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen. That is why deforestation contributes to increasing levels of Carbon Dioxide. The carbon in the tree is released back into air when it dies. CO2 and H20 are gases and water but inside the tree they are solid Hydrocarbons. The minerals that the plants take make up some of their body. Our bones are made up of calcium which comes from milk which comes from plants that cows eat and plants get them from earth's soil.\n\nNothing we are made up of is born out of nothing, everything is from the earth. Earth's diameter might be growing because of meteors or comets but not because of us. In fact I doubt meteors etc that bump into earth contribute much to earth's mass and I am sure a something is lost into space by earth as maybe, dust."

"2","What is a ""Perfect Vortex""?","A perfect vortex is supposed to be a perfect spiral in water that is stable, and can theoretically be sustained to achieve many ends, including oceanic excavation, and more.  I want to know why it is, and why it works.","Quoted:\n\nVortex flows show the sensitivity of water to external forces. The speed of movement of water in a vortex has a rhythm of its own; it extends and contracts in a rhythmic pulsation. The vortex is really composed of a series of flowing surfaces (like the ropes) all binding together as if by an invisible hand.\n\nThese flowing surfaces move at different speeds, slow on the outside and fast on the inside. The speed of movement of water in a vortex multiplied by the radius from the center is a constant. This means that forces in a perfect vortex approach infinity the hydrogen bonds of the water molecule cannot sustain the pressure difference and begin to stretch and weaken releasing powerful forces.\n\n....continued....\nWhen structured waters are made properly they are of immense benefit. Research has led to a number of other exciting discoveries relating to the benefits of structured waters upon the living system. These waters act as mineral carriers and more efficient nutrient transporters. Preliminary tests with cut flowers and other plants have shown a 400% increase in water and nutrient uptake when watered with structured water as opposed to the control group, which was watered with distilled water. What is true for plants may as well be true for animals. Preliminary experiments with vitamins and herbal extracts show a definite increase in absorption. Riboflavin, vitamin B12 is an easy vitamin to measure in urine. Testing with riboflavin has shown an increased absorption of 500% when taken with colloidal water versus distilled water.\n\nPlease refer to the site listed below:"

"3","can stress kill you?","","How much stress and of what kind?  Heat stress as well as extreme cold can kill.  Emotional stress can lower the immune system leading to illness and possibly death.  On the other hand a little stress is good for you.  Exercise is a form of stress that keeps you fit.  Mental stress (Will I fail?) may inspire you to study hard and survive the test.\n\nStress often involves the human fight and flight reaction, releasing lots of adrenalin (ever feel the hairs on your neck rise - perhaps a barking dog right behind you?  in a dark alley?).  Ancient man had to tackle a different set of problems than we do today.  Do I stand and fight the saber-toothed tiger or flee?  Adrenalin helped with either decision (but not much with the tiger battle).  A great deal of activity, kicking or running, then burned off the excess adrenalin.\n\nToday, when we get angry say at a red traffic light, we build up the adrenalin but just sit there and steem without burning it off.  And that can harm the cardiovascular system (which includes the heart).\n\nYou have a choice.  Either sit there shaking your fist fuming  at a tiny red light filament and destroy your otherwise perfect body - or - say ""I've been good and I deserve this 90 second break,"" taking your whitened fists off the steering wheel while relaxing and breething deeply.  Either way, it's your heart.  Good luck."

"2","How can water erosion uncover fossils?","","In addition to that, fossils are of a different density than the surrounding rock.  As such, erosion will wash away either the surrounding rock or the fossil first.\n\nActual animal and plant remains are usually harder - either due to the bones, or calcification in dead tissue, so erosion will expose the fossil.\n\nAnimal prints made in mud flats will be softer than the surrounding rocks and water will hollow out the print.\n\nThere are some remarkable prints in Dinosaur State Park in Texas."

"7","what is the meaning of primitive sympathy in psychology?","","Sympathy comes from the Latin sympatha, from Greek sumpatheia, from sumpaths, affected by like feelings : sun-, syn- + pathos, emotion. Thus the essence of sympathy is that a person's feelings reflect or are like those of another.\n\nSympathy exists when the feelings or emotions of one person give rise to similar feelings in another person, creating a state of shared feeling. In common usage, sympathy is usually the sharing of unhappiness or suffering, but it can also refer to sharing other (positive) emotions as well. In a broader sense, it can refer to the sharing of political or ideological sentiments, such as in the phrase ""a communist sympathiser"" .\n\nThe PSYCHOLOGICAL state of primitive sympathy is closely linked with that of empathy, but is not identical to it. Empathy refers to the ability to perceive and directly experientially feel another person's emotions as they feel them, but makes no statement as to how they are viewed. Sympathy, by contrast, implies a degree of equal feeling, that is, the sympathiser views the matter similarly to how the person themselves does. It thus implies concern, or care or a wish to alleviate negative feelings others are experiencing.\n\nThus it is possible to be:\n\n    * Empathetic but not sympathetic, by internally experiencing their feeling but not being motivated to alleviating action as a result (eg, a lust killer who is aroused by his victim's fear, or a con artist who knows how his ""mark"" feels but uses it to manipulate not support),\n      and it is also possible to be:\n    * Sympathetic but not empathetic by realising (perhaps cognitively) someone is upset and wanting to alleviate that, but not experiencing their sense of upset directly and internally as an emotional state within themselves (eg, a person at a help desk who sees another in distress, does not feel distress themselves, but tries to find what is wrong and help them anyway). \nhttp://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/sympathy"

"3","what is the best way to stop snoring?","","New Way to Stop Snoring\n\nSnoring is more than just a noisy inconvenience. Doctors say it can be a sign of a serious medical condition.\n\nSurgery or the use of a bulky face mask was the only proven way to quiet nighttime noise. But now there's new hope thanks to a new treatment called the pillar procedure. \n\nHow the Pillar Procedure works\nThe Pillar Procedure addresses one of the anatomical components of sleep apnea and snoring: the soft palate. During the Pillar Procedure, three tiny woven inserts are placed in the soft palate to help reduce the vibration that causes snoring and the ability of the soft palate to obstruct the airway. Once in place, the inserts add structural support to the soft palate. Over time, the body's natural tissue response to the inserts increases the structural integrity of the soft palate.\nhttp://www.restoremedical.com/pillar.asp"
"2","Is there really a correlation between which way a man's penis hangs and what side his heart is on?","I read this somewhere, but can no longer find the article. The theory was that when the heart is on the left side of the chest, blood pumps from that side, causing the hanging appendage to lean slightly to one side. (I forget whether the same or the opposite side.)  So, a penis that hangs to the opposite side from what is ""normal"" is supposed to be a sign of dextrocardia (having one's heart on the right instead of the left side).  \n\nI just wondered if this theory was true. Please cite sources in your answer.  Thanks!","this is not true.  not at all.  my source is that i am a urologist, and i do not see much dextrocardia, but i do see it hanging on boths sides quite often."

If it dosen't work, then please post another question. I'll reply then, based on the symptoms of the problem. VLC stands apart from other player in the category of mutlimedia players. VLC Media Player offers a one-stop solution for the file-format problem. The program supports playback of OGG, MP2, MP3, MP4, DivX, DVD, and a whole slew of other file types. In addition, it also can function as a streaming media server. Because of its open-source foundation, VLC Media Player evolves quickly, with new features and fixes released frequently. Though the interface varies from platform to platform, the sparseness of the Windows version leaves plenty to be desired. \n\nThe best part is that it can even play parts of corrupted files, which other player cannot do. Even if you don't have codecs of a particular file format, it will play it.\n\nIts also very light on memory and the processor.\n\nThe only con of this player is that its interface is too plain, no sophistication, not that good a GUI. But if you are looking for some serious Mutimedia playing, this is right for the job.\n\nYou can download it from:\nhttp://www.download.com/VLC-Media-Player/3003-2194_4-10410655.html?tag=tab_rev\n\nFor a good list of comparisons, check out :\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_media_players"

"5","FIREFOX...?","I have asked several questions, and many of the replies suggest that I consider FIREFOX.  I'm not sure what it is - probably a browser.  Is it similar to Netscape and Internet Explorer?  What are its good features and its bad features?","Firefox IS a browser, published by Mozilla, that has been competing with Internet Explorer for the past couple years. It's actually a pretty cool browser that has turned out to nab more of the market than I think most people anticipated.\n\nGood features:\nGreat pop-up and spyware protection. This is also partly due to the fact that the vast majority of viruses and spyware are written FOR Explorer, which most people are running.\nProbably the best feature of Firefox is tabbed browsing, which opens up multiple windows within a single window so that your taskbar doesn't get crowded with all of the webpages you're navigating between.\nAlso, from their website...I think this is pretty cool: ""Firefox 1.5 delivers easier navigation for everyone, including those who are visually or motor-impaired. Firefox is the first browser to support DHTML accessibility, which, when enabled by Web authors, allows rich Web applications to be read aloud.""\n\nBad features:\nThe only one so far is that since most webpages are meant to be viewed with Explorer, I had limited accessibility to some web applications. For example, when Yahoo! introduced PhotoMail, I wasn't able to download the upgraded e-mail application because the service was built for certain versions of Explorer only. But as Firefox gets more popular (they just released an upgrade) I expect this to happen less.\n\nSo the people recommending this browser were absolutely correct! I have used it for almost a year now and love it."

"4","Should we be doing other peoples homework when they post it on yahoo answers?","","It is often hard to tell when a user is posting a homework assignment or not, but there are times when it is blatently obvious.  Ideally, I think that it is best to provide a procedure and apply it to one of the problems and leave the rest unanswered.  Unfortunatly, however, these questions are often easy ones that many users can answer, and thus there will usually be one to provide an easy answer.\n\nI've answered a few of these myself before noticing that a member was posting their whole homework assignment.  I wish that they would heed the procedural answers, but it seems that the setup makes it too easy to obtain an answer.\n\nHowever, this ends up not working to the member's credit in the long run, as they do not learn the actual technique to solving their own problems.  It is their loss, though I still consider it unethical to profit (even if it is merely through points) off of these sort of questions."

"3","explain how self check help to dectect early cancer in male and female?","","Cancer cells generally have a number of characteristic changes as compared with normal cells.  They reproduce (through mitosis) very rapidly, and they do not usually stop, which can cause a lump on the breast or in the scrotum.\n\nNormal cells usually divide slower, and stop dividing either due to normal changes in the life cycle of the cell or because an external signal tells them not to divide.\n\nIf you self examine and find a lump you can go to the doctor and get the lump removed.  If the cancer cells did not enter the lymphatic system or the blood stream, the cancer should be gone with surgical removal of the lump.  If the cancer goes undetected for a while it has more of a chance to enter the blood stream and spread to other parts of the body.  \n\nThis is called metastasis, and once the cancer has spread throughout the body is far more difficult to treat, becuase it cannot be removed with a simple operation or simple localized treatment.  Also, once the cancer gets to places like the liver or pancreas, it will interfere with normal organ function, and when these organs stop working, you don't live long."

His entire stock of taffy was soaked with salty Atlantic Ocean water. When a customer asked if he had any taffy for sale, he is said to have offered some ""salt water taffy\nIs there salt water in saltwater taffy?\n\nActually, no. There is salt—and water—in saltwater taffy. But it isn’t made with ocean water, despite the fact that it’s so widely available at seaside vacation spots. \n\nSo how did saltwater taffy come to be? One story holds that a seaside candy store was flooded by a storm and the resulting saltwater-logged taffy was discovered to be delicious. However, this story is probably apocryphal"

"4","how did the ""southern accent"" or drawl come to be?","","I've included a link to a good article on this topic - good reading.  Here's an excerpt that discusses the origins:\n\n---\n\nThe general southern dialect has its origins in the English immigrants who moved to the South in the 17th and 18th centuries, of whom most were of European Celtic origins (according to an 1860 census, ""three-quarters of white Southerners had surnames that were Scottish, Irish or Welsh in origin."" [1]). \n\nThese immigrants brought with them a very distinct style of English speaking, which was then combined with the African languages spoken by the African Americans who were at this time enslaved in the South. \n\nOver time this cultural and linguistic diversity combined with the South's rural isolation, and longtime use and familiarity with the King James Version of the Bible in religious life, to produce a unique American dialect."

Anyone know?","The size of the Japanese hachimaki headband traditionally adorned for celebrations and festivals as a symbol of perserverance/effort, is a length of 85cm (33.4645669 inches.) The traditional width can vary, but is generally between 7cm (2.75590551 inches) and 8cm (3.1496063 inches.)\nThe hachimaki could be described as a wearable form of the popular American plaques, tee shirts and posters emblazoned with inspirational/motivational phrases. In modern-day Japan, the hachimaki is likely to be worn by proud employees at an office party, or by a new mother giving birth. It is popular  to customize Hachimakis with a phrase that best describes the reason for wearing it. Coworkers might present an employee with a Hachimaki gift to commemorate his or her promotion.\nThough uncertain, the origin of the Hachimaki may be related to its being worn by religious practitioners of harsh self-denial who believed that this lifestyle, at death, would result in the relinquishing of the enthralled soul and lead to its ultimate unity with the divine."

"5","Why don't people use DVI on LCD monitors only?","I read so many reviews of LCD monitors for gaming and hear how badly the monitor ""ghosts"".  When are folks going to realize that using the VGA connector is what causes the majority of that problem?  With VGA you go digital->analog->digital.  Using DVI it's pure digital all the way, which eliminates the majority of LCD gaming problem..  I'd like to see the manufacturer's stop making LCD's with analog ports on them.  Then the stupid reviews would stop.","Good point.  I have both VGA and DVI monitors and definitely notice the difference.  The DVI monitor I bought was very carefully chosen to minimize its price but even then I paid a $50-$100 premium for it over VGA monitors.  Which is weird since VGA must convert to digital to show the image whereas DVI doesn't so it sounds like less components are involved in DVI compared to VGA - go figure.  DVI is too complicated for dumb product & technology reviewers to notice, hence its relative unpopularity compared to VGA.  At least we're seeing video card manufacturers supplying S-Video, VGA, and DVI for their cards so that consumers are given greater flexibility.  If we can get consumers stop solely considering Dell and HP for their monitors, then we should see DVI becoming more popular (and cheaper)."

"4","what is a female archetype?","","An Archetype is a model of behaviour or pattern of energy that is easily recognisable and resonant to human beings. We can identify with and relate to archetypes as they are primary characters or personalities of the human condition.\n\n\nArchetypes are everywhere. They are played out in fairy tales, movies, books, TV shows, in our families, our work environments and amongst our friends.\n\nSnow white (Princess) is an archetype, Homer Simpson (Fool) is an archetype... so is Mother, Father, Son and Daughter. We instantly recognise what these roles are and how they are supposed to behave .\n\nSo the term Feminine Archetype refers to models or patterns of womanhood and feminine behaviour that are easily recognisable to us."

This is one of many marks left by German on American English."

"1","Do Christians really believe that all life started after adam and eve?","Do they believe in prehistoric time and dinosaurs etc","There's no good way to answer this question.  There are millions of Christians belonging to thousands of demoninations, etc.  \n\nMany Christians believe in the generally accepted scientific explanation of the age of the eart and certainly believe that there were dinosaurs millions of years ago.  Many other Christians take a very literal reading of the King James Version of the Bible and believe that the world is less than 6000 years old and that if dinosaurs ever lived, they must have lived at the same time as humans.  There are probably as many different viewpoints about this as there are Christians.\n\nA better question might be, What does xxx denomination teach about creation or evolution?  The Catholic church accepts evolution as does the United Methodist protestant faith.  Some denominations feel much more strongly about this than others.  \n\nIn short, there's just not one answer to your question."

"1","Why does science and religion conflict with each other so much?","","Old Goat is correct. It would help to know specifics. But consider just ONE example. The book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible. It even predates Moses. So, in that period of time, how did other cultures view the earth? Flat, supported by Atlas or giant elephants... But look what it reads in the book of Job... ""God hangs the earth on nothing."" And in Isaiah it reads, ""It is God who sits above the circle of the earth."" That word ""circle"" in Hebrew is ball or sphere. So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking, they have probably not even read the Bible to check. I know scientists who have read the Bible, and are amazed at how accurate it is.\n\nWe know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons. I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron. But because of scientific study, we know they exist. The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3...\n\n""Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.""\n\nSo the only conflict comes when secular scientist blow off the Bible without cause. I have many other examples."

"4","what is tsunami?and how is it caused?","","A tsunami (pronounced soo-nah-mee or tsoo-nah-mee [ IPA /suˈnɑːmi/ or /tsuˈnɑːmi/]) is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or the sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. Earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating.\n\nThe term tsunami comes from the Japanese language meaning harbour (""tsu"", 津) and wave (""nami"", 波 or 浪). Although in Japanese tsunami is used for both the singular and plural, in English tsunamis is well-established as the plural. The term was created by fishermen who returned to port to find the area surrounding the harbour devastated, although they had not been aware of any wave in the open water. A tsunami is not a sub-surface event in the deep ocean; it simply has a much smaller amplitude (wave heights) offshore, and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometres long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a passing ""hump"" in the ocean.\n\nTsunamis have been historically referred to as tidal waves because as they approach land they take on the characteristics of a violent onrushing tide rather than the sort of cresting waves that are formed by wind action upon the ocean (with which people are more familiar). However, since they are not actually related to tides the term is considered misleading and its usage is discouraged by oceanographers.\n\nFor more information on a tsunami, visit:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami"

The water is usually shown in blue. Colors are used to show relief—differences in land elevations. Green is typically used at lower elevations, and orange or brown indicate higher elevations.\n\nPolitical maps\n\ndo not show physical features. Instead, they indicate state and national boundaries and capital and major cities. A capital city is usually marked with a star within a circle.\n\nRoad maps\n\nshow major—some minor highways—and roads, airports, railroad tracks, cities and other points of interest in an area.

"3","What is Insulin Shock and how do you prevent it?","","Insulin shock is a severe condition in which glucose (blood sugar) levels drop quickly, leading to dizziness, vision problems, shaking, seizures, fainting and unconsciousness.\n-----------------\nMethods of prevention vary depending on the cause of the hypoglycemia.\nDrug-induced Hypoglycemia\n\nThe first step in preventing drug-induced hypoglycemia is to maintain a proper diet. Diabetics may also find it necessary to monitor their blood-sugar levels on a regular basis. Low blood-sugar levels indicate that a person should immediately eat candy or some other sweet snack. Insulin pumps are also effective in maintaining the proper level of blood sugar. These pumps can be implanted under the skin and programmed to continuously release the correct amount of insulin.\nIdiopathic Hypoglycemia\n\nIdiopathic hypoglycemia can usually be controlled by learning and following certain dietary rules. These rules include the following:\n\n    * Avoid overeating.\n    * Never skip breakfast.\n    * Include protein in all meals and snacks.\n    * Limit intake of fats, refined sugar, and processed foods.\n    * Become familiar with the sugar content in different kinds of vegetables and grain products.\n    * Keep a food diary that can be used to predict which foods produce the symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n    * Eat a regular but limited amount of fresh fruits.\n    * Follow a diet that is high in fiber."

Many cd writing programs will do them both for you.\n\nIf you don't have a cd burner, you need to do that before you go any further.  If you have one, then you have two options:\n\n1) Buy a commercial DVD burning program like Nero that will make the process painless.\n\n2) Do it for free using the following instructions:\n\n1) Download and install burnatonce (http://www.burnatonce.com)\n2) Open the program and click the menu item Mastering > Audio CD\n3) Click ""Add Files"" and select the MP3's you wish to burn to the disc. The program will add a 2 second pause between tracks unless you uncheck that option.\n4) When finished click ""Compile"".  The program will create temporary decoded audio files of the mp3's (this will take a while depending on the speed of your computer).  When it is done it will ask you if you want to 'load it into main'.  Say yes.\n5)  Finally, click the big ""Write"" button.  It will burn your CD and you are finished!"

You can also go Run ->MSCONFIG & go to the Startup tab & look for it there. When you find it, simply uncheck the box & it should disable it from starting with Windows. I would suggest, however, that you should leave MSCONFIG alone unless you are VERY comfortable with Windows or that you don't click anything unless you are CERTAIN it is the right thing as the wrong change to MSCONFIG can cause Windows not to boot up properly."

It's sustainable because theoretically you could continue building without any net negative effects from your development.\n\nNo development is truly sustainable.  You can't blanket 100% of the land on the earth with buildings without a negative effect on the planet, but for instance, if you can replant the same number of trees that you use to build, or restore a developed plot of land to natural flora and fauna, that would be considered sustainable."

"4","How do I become a Registered Nurse ???","I want to be a Registurned Nurse, but I don't know what to take classes for in College. I'm in Chicago, IL.","Registered nursing actually has 2 different tracks (there may still be 3).  One may become an RN by going to junior or community college for 2 years and then taking the license exam.   Another way is a 4 year BSN that will prepare you not only for patient care, but for nursing management as well.  Many of the nurses I worked with started out the an ASN (2 yr degree) and then went on to the BSN while working as an RN.  \n\nThere may still be some 3 year diploma courses, but those are going away.  Years ago that was the norm and there were many hospital based diploma courses, but of late they have become college based and ASN or BSN degrees. \n\nAnother route is to take an LPN course which takes about a year and then work as an LPN while going on to RN school.  \n\n There is a well established distance learning program leading to the RN credential at Excelsior College in New York (It was called Regents College and you still hear the term Regents degreed nurse).  \n\nCheck with the NLN - the National League for Nursing as it is the program accreditor for Nursing schools.  It will be very hard to get a job or a license if your school is not NLN accredited. \n\nAlso check your state's licensing board to see if they have any special requirements."

"7","How much notice should you give a landlord before moving out?","","Proper Notice to Leave\nWhen a tenant wants to move out of a rental unit, it is important that the proper kind of notice be given to the landlord. The following discusses how to end the two most common types of rental agreements. However, it is important that tenants check their own rental agreements to determine what kind of notice must be given before they move out.\n\nLeases. If the tenant moves out at the expiration of a lease, in most cases it is not necessary to give the landlord a written notice. However, the lease should be consulted to be sure a formal notice is not required.\n\nIf a tenant stays beyond the expiration of the lease, and the landlord accepts the next month's rent, the tenant then is assumed to be renting under a month-to-month agreement.\n\nA tenant who leaves before a lease expires is responsible for paying the rent for the rest of the lease. However, the landlord must make an effort to re-rent the unit at a reasonable price. If this is not done, the tenant may not be liable for rent beyond a reasonable period of time.\n\nMonth-to-Month Rental Agreements. When a tenant wants to end a month-to-month rental agreement, written notice must be given to the landlord. The notice must be received at least 20 days before the end of the rental period (the day before rent is due). The day on which the notice is delivered does not count. A landlord cannot require a tenant to give more than 20 days notice when moving out.\n\nWhat if a tenant moves out without giving proper notice? The law says the tenant is liable for rent for the lesser of: 30 days from the day the next rent is due, or 30 days from the day the landlord learns the tenant has moved out. However, the landlord has a duty to try and find a new renter. If the dwelling is rented before the end of the 30 days, the former tenant must pay only until the new tenant begins paying rent.\n\nWhen a landlord wants a month-to-month renter to move out, a 20-day notice is required."
"2","How does the level of a well affect the work (Horsepower) that a water pump has to do in a lift station?","I am dealing with a centrifugal or positive displacement pump where the setpoint can be change in this case increase the well level posibly to decrease horsepower used.","well, (heh),\n\nlifting a mass m of anything a height h against the force of gravity requires an amount of energy that is equal to E = mgh, where g is the acceleration of gravity - 9.8 m/s^2.  \n\nthe power comes from dividing by how long it takes to do this - power is energy / time.  so P = mgh/t.  that means the pump requires that much power to do so.\n\nso, if you decrease h in the above equation, the power goes down.  it is a linear relationship, so if you halve the height over which you are pumping, you halve the amount of power required.\n\nnote that this ignores the frictional nature of water, which is reasonable if the water is not moving very fast in the pump or pipes.  if it is, you have a more complicated problem."

"2","If an engine does 500 joules of work to pull a 10kg load 4 meters, what is the efficiency of the engine?","","all you have to do is calculate the work that the engine should have done.  W=Fx meaning work equals force times distance.  The force is mass times acceleration, so it would be 10 x 9.8 (9.8 meters per second squared is the acceleration due to gravity) giving you 98 (lets round to 100 so i dont have to get a calculator or think too much because im tired, and your other data only has one significant figure anyway, if you think you need it more precise you can go get a calculator and do the work im going to show you with 98 on a calculator...)\n\nanyway, so to find the work (W=Fx) you multiply the force we just found (100N) by the distance so you get 100N x 4m = 400J.\n\nNow you know that the engine should have done 400J of work, but instead it did 500J, meaning that it did extra work, so it's not 100% efficient, so to find the percentage of its efficiency, just divide 400/500 and multiply that by 100 to get the percentage.  So its .8 x 100 so 80%.\n\nAnd if i may ask, why do you keep asking very basic questions on completely random physics topics that you would clearly not be doing all at once, and if you already did all of it, you should already know these answers?"

How? Why?), Treatment of Native Americans (What did mean for the Western growth of this country after this group was finally broken?), and role of Immigration (How did this relate to this development?)","I'd look at the Monroe Doctrine (i think).  It has a statement by a former president that says that the American dream should be for the country to touch the atlantic and the pacific.  \nUS rail system encouraged travelers & those moving by providing efficient transportation.\nFed Govt encouraged this by buying, annexing, and winning by force property that is now the United States.\nNative Americans presented a barrier and discouraged those moving to live in a place where raids were frequent.  The US should have made terms with the Native Americans to make peace in the beginning.\nImmigrants went where ever jobs were needed, so they were always ready to move somewhere else if they could get a job.\nHope it helps."

"7","what is the meaning of life?","","Socrates and Plato and a thousand other deep thinkers down through history have tried to define or explain the meaning of life.  Each with his own perception and understanding and most times with a very complicated explanation.\n\n   It was not until I took up hiking in the mountains of Tennessee that I had plenty of time to ponder the complexities of this age old question.  Being a Christian I was raised to believe certain things and to look at life in certain ways.  But as I got older and began studying and searching for myself I began to realize that what I was taught as a child was not as complicated as some would have had me believe.\n\n   I always wondered why God would have put us here simply to suffer through this life.  After all he does love us and of that I have no doubt.  So why then?  I studied and pondered and reflected in deep thought just like many have before me, and like them, to no avail.\n\n  Then one day while hiking the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee I came to a clearing overlooking a valley.  It was a clear day with the sun shining bright.  As I looked out across the valley I saw an eagle soaring on the wind.  And as usual the thought crossed my mind that it would be really nice to be able to soar like that.  Then I thought, do eagles look at us and wish they were like us?\n\n   That is when something inside me clicked.  It was more like an explosion or an awakening of sorts.  The meaning of life was so simple that I had looked right past it thinking that it would be some big discovery of some sort.  Some words of wisdom that would make me look like a genius.  Instead three words kept going through my brain.  Thundering as if God himself was speaking them directly into my thoughts.\n\n   We spend our entire lives from the moment we take our first breath til our last one is used up trying to be something we aren't.  Whether we are trying to get a job by seeming more experienced or trying to win someones heart by becoming the person they are looking for.  We act differently in different situations.  Why? \n\n    It is in our nature I suppose or at least the nature of the flesh.  But God's nature is to be the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.  And since we are to strive to be more ""God-like"", which I used to think meant to try to be perfect, then the meaning of life is nothing more than to ""JUST BE YOU!""\n\n   Yep, it is just that simple.  Be you no matter what happens or where you are or who you are with or what you are trying to achieve.  If you can do this you will be something that the majority of people will never be.  Good, bad or indifferent you will Just Be You."

Is there any way I can listen to his broadcasts / podcasts through the net ?

"2","where is the northstar?","","Due North.  There are a couple of ways to find it.  One is to face due north and look up a bit.  If you know your latitude, you can find the North Star by looking up that many degrees from the horizon.  Hence, if you're in SF like me, the North Star will be ~38 degrees above the horizon.\n\nThe easier way is to find the Big Dipper\nhttp://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/exo/constellations/bigdipper.gif\nWhich is a prominent and easy constellation to find in the northern sky.  Then, close one eye, stretch out your arm, and spread your fingers so that the front two stars (across from the ""handle"") are each covered by one of your fingers.  Those front two stars point right at the North Star.  Trac out in a straight line from those two stars, going ""up"" (if you imagine the dipper being oriented in a way that it would hold water) for a distance that is five times the distance between those two front stars.  So if you swing your arm along, placing the lower finger where the top finger just was, and keeping the spacing of your fingers steady, it will direct you to a bright star.  That star is the North Star."

"10","A paragraph to define Shi'ite, Kurds, Sunni factions?","Keep reading about them, but don't have a handy-dandy guide to remember their differences.","Islam does not have nearly as many sects and divisions as does Christianity, but there are a few and it is worth knowing something about them. The two biggest are the Sunnis and the Shi'ites, with the Sunnis being the largest of all and representing the vast majority of Muslims. Shi'ites are a minority everywhere except Iran. \n\nAfter them, the two most influential sects are the Sufis and the Wahhabis. The Sufis represent a mystical tradition in Islam, whereas the Wahhabis are a strict traditionalist tradition which is dominant on the Arabian peninsula, but has little support elsewhere. \n\nUnlike churches, mosques are not denominational. Despite the differences among Muslims, traditional Friday prayer services are largely similar and Muslims of any background are welcome to attend services at any mosque. \n\nWho are the Sunnis?\nSunnis are Muslims who are considered the more ""orthodox"" believers. Sunnis follow all of the most traditional beliefs and actions. \n\nWho are the Shi'ites?\nThe term Shi'a is a shortened form of Shi'at Ali, which means ""the party of Ali"" - and at the time of Ali's death in 661, that is probably all it was: a party or tendency of people who supported Ali's claims to the caliphate. Over time, they became the largest non-Sunni sect in Islam. \n\nWho are the Sufis?\nSufism is important to the development of Islam because it is in this tradition that the more spiritual and mystical aspects were preserved. This stands in contrast to the mainstream of Islam which, through its first centuries, was more concerned with the expansion and organization of the general community. \n\nWho are the Kahrijites?\nIn Arabic, their label means ""to go out"" - they were, in effect, the first Mulism dissidents and rebels, being present almost from the dawn of Islam. Like later dissidents, they chose to separate themselves from the main body of believers, feeling that the majority of Muslims had lost the ""true path."" \n\nWho are the Wahhabis?\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab could be considered the first modern Islamic fundamentalist. He made the central point of his reform movement the idea that absolutely every idea added to Islam after the third century of the Mulsim era was false and should be eliminated. \n\nWho are the Ismailis?\nAn early Shi'a sect which split from the main group because of a dispute over who should be considered the next Imam. \n\nWho are the Zaidis?\nFormed by Zaid, a grandson of Husain, the Zaidis have believed that the true Imam must publicly assert his claim to the title and seek to overthrow the corrupt regime run by unacceptable rulers. \n\nWho are the Fatimids?\nThe Fatimids are a successor movement to the Isma'ilis and are descendants of Fatima and Ali through the line of Isma'il. In the tenth century, those descendants asserted themselves as caliphs in North Africa, and ruled Egypt from 969 to 1171. \n\nWho are the Nizari?\nThis sect is actually very well known around the world, but under a different name: the Assassins. \n\nWho are the Alawis?\nAlso known as Nusayris, the Alawis are a branch of Isma'ilism which has gone so far along its own path that many Muslims no longer even regard it as a form of Islam. The term Alawis actually just means ""followers of Ali,"" which is used in some countries to refer to all Shi'a in general. Some think that they worship Ali as God, but that isn't entirely accurate. \n\nWho are the Druze?\nThe Druze comprise another sect which is not widely regarded as being ""truly"" Muslim. This group diverged from mainstream Islam in the eleventh century when some Isma'ilis started to believe that God became manifest in the personality of a prophet or imam. \n\nWho are the Baha'i?\nBaha'i is another movement which is descended from Islam, but which most Muslims today no longer regard as authentically Islamic. \n\nMost of these are Arab Muslims.. The Kurds"

"1","How do I know when God speaks to me?","How will I know when God wants me to do something or when he speaks to me? Sometimes I believe it's his voice, then I believe it's me thinking to myself. How do I know?","Good question!!!!! I always wondered about that, too. We talked about it at Bible study one week and we found some good Scripture passages that help.\n1 Corinthians 10:12 says that discernment is a spiritual gift that some people have. Discernment is basically being able to tell the difference between spirits (whether it is from God, yourself, or the      ).  \nBut not everyone has the gift to tell the difference, so what do you do if you don't have that gift?\n1 John 4:1-3 says to test the spirits to see if they are from God. These verses refer to prophets, but it applies to spirits, also. Test them to see if they seem to be from God, and pray that God will reveal to you whether it is from Him or not. He will provide you with answers!\nIn Acts 16:16-19, we see that spirits can come from the      , but they may seem to be from God (the message may seem to be true and good). This is another case where you just have to pray and then trust that God will show you whether it is Him speaking to you or not. \nAll in all, it just involves a lot of prayer. Pray that God will reveal to you whether it is His voice or not. He will show you. Sometimes you'll just get a feeling that will tell you it is Him, and sometimes there will be signs everywhere you turn that tell you what the right thing is to do. \nCheck out Isaiah 30:21. It's a pretty sweet verse. Just keep trusting in God!"

"10","Can anybody form there own country and how would you form a country?","","First, you must acquire territory.  Since all territory on the Earth is currently affiliated with a country, you would need to either buy it or take it by force.  \n\nAlternately, you could attempt to form an artificial island in international waters (no one owns the sea out about 10 miles from land.)  This has actually been done- google ""Sealand.""\n\nThen you must be able to defend it.  This can be done by either forming and maintaining your own military (this is the ususal way) or by getting other countries to protect you.  Monaco and Luxembourg are both tiny countries with no real military power, but if anyone invades them NATO allies will probably stop that (because, really- why beat up on Monaco?)  Sealand, for instance, was attacked several times.\n\nYou will also need some citizens and a form of government (republicanism, communism, democracy etc.) \n\nFinally, you need a sustainable economy- your people have to do something to support themselves and your government."

President Theodore Roosevelt, impressed with Brenner’s plaque, recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury that Brenner’s design be used on a coin to be issued in 1909, the Lincoln Centennial Year. The direction Lincoln faces on the cent was not mandated—it was simply Brenner’s design choice.\n\nIn 2005, the portrait of Thomas Jefferson also faces right.

"5","getting hits from a search engine?","","Long answer short : Follow three steps :\n\n(1) Put good content on your site\n(2) Register it to search engines\n(3) Convince other sites to link more.\n\nExplaination :\n\nI could have gone on lenght on answering your query.  At the first part, one need's to understand the meaning of page rank. You can study a detailed article on it at http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html\n\nIn short, here's an example. There's an election and several candidates have stood up. Its natural that the guy with the most votes wins. Analogously, whenever a external page links to your website, it casts a vote for your website. So, when you search for a relevant keyword for your pages, the results come as per the no of links that you have collected.\n\nTo get more links, you can ask some of your friends who have website to put link to your website. The more the links, the higher is your rank in google results. An alternative is to start your own blog on 3-4 websites, and in each blog, put a link to your website. Indeed, if your site has quality content, mpressed visitors start linking you, specially the blogging community.\n\nAnother important part is that who links you. For example, if you get a link from a website which already has a high page rank, you automatically get a better rank. For example, if you get a link from microsoft.com or cnet.com, which have a highest page ranks, your rank shoots up automatically.\n\nGoogle rank is composed of many other factors, but the only factor it misses out is the popularity by visitors who go to the links directly. Yahoo does a good job by keeping that into account. If you carefully see the link that are seen in the Yahoo search results, a similar vote is also casted by clicking on the link in the search results. It could be possible that your website has huge no. of visitors who come through searches, but small number of links. Then its Yahoo rank would be high (more accurate), but google rank would be low. There have been many such interesting cases, so don't just consider google as your only target. Why google does not keep this 'click popularity' feature is because it takes a certain delay of time( for registering of vote on Yahoo and forwarding to the actual link), which Google does not want to take.\n\nThings You Should Never Do In Life:\nNever try to promote your site commercially from spamsters. Some of their sites are banned from google database. And if they give a link to your website, your page rank drops down drastically, and even might get removed from the search results. Also, do not link to their websites.\n\nThis is the solution to crux of your problem. You can read further on such search engine optimizations at the following sites :\nhttp://wolfram.org/writing/howto/3.html\nhttp://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterGoogleRankings.aspx\nhttp://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/promo_no16.htm\nhttp://us.ecademy.com/node.php?id=58077\nhttp://www.paramountwebmasters.com/improve_my_rankings_on_google.php\nhttp://www.graphic-design.com/Web/increase_rank.html"

"1","Who is Yahshua? Who is Yahweh? Who is Elohim?","Did Yahweh command or allow for His Names and titles to be changed?\n\nBe serious about your answer. And be prepared to be challenged by the hebrew and greek manuscripts, which were used to translate the bible you read!!!","Yahshua is Hebrew for what we term ""Joshua"" which means Jehovah is Salvation.\n\nYahweh is the closest we can come to what God called Himself since the Jewish scholars refused to spell out His Name fully. The closest we have is the consonants YHWH, or YaHWeH.\n\nEl is the word for God. Elohim is the plural--not ""gods"" but God in the mystic threefold unity. The Echad. See my study below, ""Is God One or Three?""\n\nYHWH did not command for His names or titles to be changed. However, He also did not punish the Hebrews or the new Gentile church for it either. He knows who He is. He is the God of Abraham, Ysaak and Yakob, and His Name is to be worshipped and praised. Baruch HaShem Adonai. :)"

"4","What does PhD. mean?","What does PhD. stand for??","Doctorate of Philosophy\n\nDoctor of Philosophy, or Ph.D. (an abbreviation for the Latin ""Philosophiæ Doctor""; or alternatively Doctor philosophiæ, D.Phil.), was originally a degree granted by a university to a learned individual who had achieved the approval of his peers and who had demonstrated a long and productive career in the field of philosophy. The appellation of ""Doctor"" (from Latin: teacher) was usually awarded only when the individual was in middle age. It indicated a life dedicated to learning, to knowledge, and to the spread of knowledge.\n\nThe degree was popularized in the 19th century at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin as a degree to be granted to someone who had undertaken original research in the sciences or humanities. From here it spread to the U.S., arriving at Yale University in 1861, and then to the UK in 1921. This displaced the existing Doctor of Philosophy degree in some Universities; for instance, the D.Phil. (higher doctorate in the faculty of philosophy) at the University of St Andrews was discontinued and replaced with the Ph.D. (research doctorate). However, some UK universities such as Oxford, York and Sussex retain the D.Phil. appellation for their research degrees, as does the University of Waikato in New Zealand.\n\nSome ability to carry out original research must be documented by producing a dissertation or thesis of book length. The degree is often a prerequisite for permanent employment as a university lecturer or as a researcher in some sciences, though this varies on a regional basis. In others such as engineering or geology, a doctoral degree is considered desirable but not essential for employment. In a small but growing number of fields, the doctorate is felt to injure employment prospects by causing 'overqualification' for the job.\n\nIn layman's terms, it's someone who has spent a large amount of time doing research in a particular field, usually on a very specific subject, and been able to demonstrate that they have an advanced understanding of that subject -- particularly their specific research area."
"2","In the Rh blood group categorization, what does Rh stand for?","","Rh simply means Rhesus.  When we are born we recieve 3 rhesus genes from each of our parents that make up what our blood time will eventually be.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n'We all inherit a set of three Rhesus (Rh) genes from each parent called a haplotype. You may have heard of the c, d, e, C, D and E genes. The upper case letters denote Rh positive genes and the lower case, negative and we inherit either a positive or negative of each gene from each parent (eg. CDe/cde, cdE/cDe etc.). This means that we then possess two of each gene and can pass either to our offspring.

"10","Do judges and lawyers do jury duty?","","As the above answerers indicate, judges and lawyers are called to jury duty, but they rarely end up on a jury since the lawyers in the case generally don't want an ""expert"" on the jury (same reason why physicians rarely end up on juries in malpractice cases).  A recent example of a judge being called for jury duty is US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer (see Source #1).\n\nYet lawyers and judges sometimes DO end up on juries.  One recent example is Nassau County, NY District Judge William J. O'Brien, who served on a jury hearing a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff's lawyer thought the judge would possibly be ""a little more savvy to defense tricks,"" while the defense attorney said for a medical malpractice case, he wanted ""jurors who are intelligent and analytical"" (See Source #2).\n\nAs you can see, it is not unheard of to have lawyers or judges sit on a jury, but it is certainly rare.

However, new research carried out in the United Kingdom has revealed two important things we did not know before about this extinct bird.\n\nFirstly, the Dodo came from a distant family of Asian pigeons.

Thats why if you go to a post secondary school you are not becoming smarter, your only proving to your potential employer that you are smart enough to complete the school and that u gained knowledege (information) needed to perform the job. Now if what you ment is you want to memorize better, then do a quick search on memorization skills and pick the best that suites you."

If the people actually read the bible, they would have learned that the church was twisting the scriptures and the Catholic church would have lost its stronghold. To think, the catholic church didnt just burn bibles, they burned people alive! just for having one in their posession. Nowadays, the catholic church tends to not refer to the bible, preferring to teach dogma, this way they can say whatever they want and if you are catholic you have to believe it because according to their teachings they ""conveniently"" have the authority granted to them to teach whatever they want regardless of whether it agrees with scripture and it is as though it was stated by God himself.

Carbon can have up to four single bonds. Besides, it can have double or triple bonds, allowing for even more variations than its heavier homologue Silicon.\n\nOne of my old chemistry professors gave three ""fundamental theorems"" for organic chemistry:\n\n- Carbon always has four bonds\n- Nucleophile will react with electrophile (slightly  negative ends with slightly positive ones)\n- Whenever the opportunity to form a ring of five or six atoms offers itself during a reaction, it will be taken.\n\nBetter than 95% of organic chemistry can be deduced using these rules."

"2","a list of what can cause space pollution?","","Old satellites contribute a lot to the pollution around our planet. A snippet from the article below,\n\nAlthough penetration of space by people and their machines is but a few decades old, already the space above the Earth has become contaminated. There are now 110,000 man-made objects larger than a half-inch orbiting in the space above the Earth, and the situation has gotten so serious that NASA 'now replaces pitted orbiter windows after most flights' of space shuttles, notes a 1987 US National Research Council report that warns of potentially catastrophic collisions with space debris. The amount of 'space junk' has doubled since 1990 and now poses 'a navigational hazard,' says Norwegian space specialist Erik Tandberg. The US and Norway are planning a giant radar station to be called Globus II in Norway's Arctic specifically to better monitor orbiting debris.\n\n'A total of over 3,000 tons of space debris surrounds the Earth today,' says Dr. Alexey Yablokov, a noted biologist and president of the Centre for Russian Environmental Policy. The 'rapid accumulation of debris' could 'complicate the further development of astronautics since there would be a direct threat of collision with debris fragments which travel at very high altitudes,' says Dr. Yablokov.\n\nAmong the junk now overhead are 37 nuclear-powered satellites put in space by the US and former Soviet Union. The operation of the satellites is over but the radioactive fuel in them is still hot and lethal and they'll be falling back to Earth in the centuries ahead."

"2","who first theorized that the human body was made up cells?","","In 1824, Rene Dutrochet discovered that ""the cell is the fundamental element in the structure of living bodies, forming both animals and plants through juxtaposition."" However, the first sightings of the internal action of the cell were made by Robert Brown. In Berlin, Johannes Muller created connections between biology and medicine, prompting the connective thinking of his students, such as those of Theodore Schwann. Schwann created the term ""cell theory"" and declared that plants consisted of cells. This declaration was made after that of Matthias Schlieden's (1804 - 1881) that animals are composed of cells.\n\nLeeuwenhoek was first to describe cells and coined the word more than 100 years before, but he didn't really make the leap to how fundamental the unit was."

"7","Is it illegal for an employer to pay you only for scheduled hours, even if you clock in early?","At my work, if someone clocks in before their scheduled time, they are not paid until their beginning start time on the schedule.  Can they do that?  Kentucky","No, they owe you nothing. Unless you are working for a set salary, your employer has the absolute right to set your standard work hours. If you clock in early, without being directed by an authorized supervisor to do so, then you are, in effect, establishing your own work hours and schedule. Likewise, if you work more than 8 hours, they would be mandated under federal law to pay for the overtime, which they might not have in their budget. The FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act) is very clear about such things. Yes, you can be  ""docked"" (penalized with loss of pay) for clocking in late, but you're not allowed to sign in to work even a minute before your scheduled starting time. I really wish it were not this way, but imagine what would happen if this were allowed to happen? You clock in 10 minutes before your shift, but I clock in an hour beforehand. Where does a manager draw the line at the definition of ""early for work""? To be fair to all, they had to make this an absolute starting time. Sorry! If you want to clock in early, see your manager about adjusting your shift starting time."

"1","Is it true that if we're not careful, America will soon become a communist country?","According to Karl Marx's list of ten things needed to become a communist country the U.S has applied-in one form or another- nine of them.","""America"" is not a country, it's a continent formed by three sub-continents (north, central and south america).\n\nNow about the question, since it's about the USA... Marx's wrote his works more than 100 years ago, with Germany in mind (the fact that Russia was the place where the revolution took place and was successful is still a high topic among historians) --by then, the USA was an underdeveloped country, without a big proletarian base or an industrial/urban developed production system, which was the requested condition for the revolution (again, Russia was a contradiction to this request). Therefore, you cannot apply Marx's theory 'directly' to a country today. The capitalist system has developed internal restraints and ""decompressing"" mechanisms that ensure that, even when the inequality and the poverty or the income distribution are ignominious, the system is not under danger of disruption.\n\nCapitalism, as Marx said, might have the seed of self destruction, but it also has selfpreservation mechanisms (corporations, NGOs, formal democracy --even in non-democratic countries--). Also, it offers what some people might call a 'messianic' or 'religious' promise: the best of the worlds is here, on earth and while you are alive, and you need money and success to attain it (I am talking about the protestant capitalism, not the catholic one, which came later): therefore, the success of capitalism is guaranteed by the fact that the lower classes want to become middle class, and middle class wants to become high class. This ensures all of them, especially the middle class, is ultra-conservative, fighting to keep the status-quo, so they can (someday) be high-class and enjoy what the system promises (of course, the status-quo needs to be based on inequality, so you have classes and people fight to escalate in the social chain).\n\nwhat do I know?..."

If they have one, then politely explain to them that you'd really like a napster subscription better, and so you'd like to exchange it.  It's not a big deal unless you make it one."

"7","Who is Robbie Williams?","This name like I've heard before..","Robert Williams is an English pop singer. Williams' early pop career started with the hit boy band Take That. The band was formed in 1990 and proved to be highly successful, with 8 UK Number 1 singles to their credit. \n\nOut of all the members of Take That, Robbie Williams never really seemed to fit in. Roguishly handsome where his bandmates were merely cute, Williams was tougher and sexier than the rest, which made him more distinctive. He also fought regularly with the other members and their management, primarily because he was occasionally adverse to being so heavily packaged. So it didn't come as a surprise that he was the first to leave the band, departing early in the summer of 1995 to pursue a solo career; by some accounts, he was fired from the group. Although he was the first out of the gate, it took Williams awhile to get started.\n\n Williams released his first solo album, Life Thru a Lens, in 1997. The album became a big hit in Britain, prompting his second, I've Been Expecting You, in 1998. The Ego Has Landed, a U.S.-only compilation designed for breaking Williams to American audiences, was released stateside in the spring of 1999. Sing When You're Winning followed in late 2000, gaining success with the video hit ""Rock DJ,"" while a big-band album of standards (Swing When You're Winning) appeared a year later. During 2002, Williams celebrated an enormous new contract with EMI (rumored to be upward of 80 million dollars), but suffered the loss of his longtime production partner, Guy Chambers. Escapology, the fifth Robbie Williams album (and the last including Chambers' input), sold millions of copies in Europe, though it failed to persuade American audiences. As a result, the 2003 concert record Live at Knebworth wasn't released in the States.\n\nIn 2002, the UK public voted Williams to be on the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons (at number 77). He was also voted 17th in Channel 4's 100 Worst Britons poll.\n\n\nFor more information on him, please refer to the following links :\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams\nhttp://www.google.com/musica?aid=KIL_YZIrTEP&oi=musicr\n\nList of all 182 songs and lyrics :\nhttp://robbie-williams.lyrics-songs.com/ \n\nTo Watch his videos:\nhttp://www.mtv.com/music/artist/williams_robbie/artist.jhtml"

"8","What is the real meaning of Festivus?","","While it first came to the attention of most of America by way of the December 18, 1997 episode of Seinfeld, the celebration of a holiday called Festivus is part of human history throughout the ages, most notably in ancient Rome, nineteenth-century California, and upstate New York in the 1960s.\n\nBy December 2004, when Allen Salkin's article about Festivus as a real holiday appeared in the New York Times, thousands of people around the world were celebrating Festivus with parties, grievance-airing, pole-erecting, beer-brewing and the invention of new Festivus rituals.\n\nFestivus is a non-denominational holiday that has no required rituals or totems, but many celebrants find the pole, the Airing of Grievances and the Feats of Strength essential, especially those Festivus-friendly folk who adhere to the Seinfeld orthodoxy.\n\nFestivus Pole\n\nAn unadorned length of lusterless metal or something that looks like metal, this central totemic element of Festivus can be mighty or meek. Some poles are pinky-short and some tetherball-tall. Erected on a lawn, balanced in a coffee can near a photocopier, stuck in a pail of rocks in the living room or suspended from fishing line on the front porch. the pole symbolizes nothing.\n\nThe Airing of Grievances\n\nLike everything else Festivus, the AOG has evolved some wild variations, but the core of it remains lashing into others and the world about how they have been disappointments. This usually brings participants into a circle of sorts in which each takes turns excoriating friends, enemies, relatives, acquaintances and strangers. When all who care to have taken a turn griping, there is no required hugging or making up.\n\nFeats of Strength\n\nThe FOS generally follows the AOG. Under the Seinfeld orthodoxy, Festivus is not over until the head of the household is wrestled to the floor and pinned. While there is an undeniable classic elegance to this, real world Festivus practitioners have developed other cathartic methods of discharging pent-up energy against one's fellows, including thumb wrestling and washer tossing."
"2","how many miles from earth to the moon?","","238,855 miles give or take a couple miles (seriously, it varies)\n\nI used Frink to look it up.  Frink is an incredibly handy calculation tool on the web.\n\n\nWikipedia says the moon is an average distance of 238,857 miles from the earth. I just checked with it to verify the accuracy of Frink, which looks pretty good.\n\nNeither the moon nor the Earth are perfectly round.  In fact, the Earth is kind of pear-shaped and has some rather high mountain ranges on its surface.\n\nAfter you are done doing serious analysis of the moon you should play around with Frink; it is pretty amazing and has built-in constants defined in it for all kinds of measurements having to do with the earth and moon. It also makes it very easy to convert values to different units of measurement."

Before you go to the embassy you have to call them for an appointment schedule. And for example they tell you that your schedule will be on December blah blah blah on 10AM, so you go there 10 mins before 10AM only to find out that the people did not follow the schedule and came in earlier. And you have to wait in line. The embassy is tolerating the people who came ahead of their schedule.

"2","For those that believe that the Big Bang created the universe, what existed before the Big Bang?","","Several of the previous answers have some really good points.  The truth is we don't have the mental capabilities yet to understand the size and extent of the universe, or even the amount of time it's been here.  So it's at best a weak guess as to what was here before, if there was a before, but there has to be a before, at least in our own ways of thinking.  It would probably take a few Einstien's to figure these things out. What I mean by that is someone who could think as far ahead in our time as he did in his time.\n\nThen, unfortunately, as has happened in every culture since they started looking at the moon, we come up with a God to explain what we can't explain and then we have wars and fights and judgement on others who don't accept this God.  I guess we should go back to beheading people who try to figure things out instead of closing their mind and blaming it on God."

"2","Is time continuous or discreet? Can we divide time into ever smaller units or is there a smallest time unit?","","The normal answer, and the one which all conventional theories of physics are based on is that time is modelled as a real number.  In relativity theory intervals of time are defined as a kind of generalised distance between two points in a 4-dimensional geometry.  This 4-dimensional geometry (aka space-time) is defined using real numbers, resulting in distances always being real numbers, and so there ends up being no smallest distance.\n\nQuantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics have the same continuum underlying space and time, but the complication is that whilst time is continuous it is not possible to _measure_ time scales less than a certain amount.  But still, the equations of the theory are still written in terms of differentIAL (c.f. difference) equations and are thus fundamentally continuous.\n\nThe impossibility of measuring suficiently small time scales has led _some_ theorists to consider the possibility that spacetime is actually a lattice of discrete points, thus making space and time fundamentally quantised.  It has the advantage that if you make the additional assumption that the overall size of the universe is finite then integrals over the whole of space (which might not converge) end up being just finite sums, which always converge.  Still, the theory has a long way to go simply to catch up with present-day theories, and is certainly not mainstream theoretical physics."

"5","How does wifi work?","","Wi-Fi (also WiFi or wifi) is a trademark for sets of product compatibility standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs). Wi-Fi was intended to allow mobile devices, such as laptop computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) to connect to local area networks, but is now often used for wireless Internet access and wireless VoIP phones. Desktop computers can also use Wi-Fi, allowing offices and homes to be networked without expensive wiring. Many computers are sold today with Wi-Fi built-in; others require adding a Wi-Fi network card. Other devices, such as digital cameras, are sometimes equipped with Wi-Fi.\n\nA Wi-Fi–enabled device is able to connect to a local area network when near one of the network's access points. The connection is made by radio signals; there is no need to plug the device into the network. If the local area network is connected to the Internet, the Wi-Fi device can have Internet access as well. The geographical region covered by one or several access points is called a hotspot. The range of an access point varies.

Why is it so?","The flame will heat the air molecules above it.These gas particles being free to move in any direction will move in the direction which has least opposition to it's motion .This is because the air above the gas has a lower density and hence is sparcer than the air below it .also the flame particles have a higher energy (due to their temperature)they tend to stay as far away from each other as possible .This creates a lower density of air around the flame .This low density sir will be pushed up by the surrounding air of higher density due to buoyant forces.Due to both these regions the flame has to move up"

"4","how accurate IQ tests Are?","","There is little accuracy in IQ tests, because intelligence can only be described with ordinal measurement, i.e.  highest, next highest, etc.  So IQ results can only be used in a comparative sense.  In addition, the concept of ""intelligence"" is complex and vague so only generalized comparisons can be made.  Note that part of the definition of IQ is that the average is defined at 100.  So, if we could get a concrete measurement of total human intelligence, the average would always be 100, no matter whether the true amount changed or stayed the same.\n\nMany online ""IQ tests"" are not true IQ tests anyway.  The only truly valid IQ tests are those administered by professionals.   A real IQ test measures pattern recognition and problem solving abilities; ideally patterns and problems that the testee has never encountered before.  A really good IQ test should not even be language dependent, except for the basic instructions to start the test.\n\nMany online ""IQ tests"" include questions about math, science, etc.  While these are valid questions, they are measuring knowledge, which is quite a different thing from intelligence.\n\nThis isn't to say that IQ isn't valid or useful.  There is a distinct difference between people with high vs. average vs. low IQ.  However, outside of a clinical setting, the use of IQ is doubtful."

Why did it happen?","The answers ""ME!"" and ""Because you touch yourself at night"" are not valid answers.\nScientific answers only.","Wikipedia has an excellent article on this.  According to them, there are 3 main theories:\n\n1. Asteroid collision\n\nBasically a huge rock hit our planet causing a plum of sediment to float into our atmosphere reducing light from the sun.  This reduction killed off a huge portion of the existing plant life, thus wiping out the food supply for many animals.  As one thing leads to another, massive extinctions followed.\n\n2. The Oort cloud\n\nSimilar to the asteroid theory, an Oort cloud is a literal storm of comets.  The results follow pretty closely with the single asteroid theory.\n\n3. Environment changes\n\nThis is a little more vague, but also a little simpler to prove to a degree (pun intended).  The theory follows the notion of the magnetic poles flipping (causing tremendous weather changes), or some other massive event (such as the melting of the caps, or an ice age) that would in turn kill off most of the larger species on the planet.\n\nFor further information, please read the wikipedia article."

The amount of money you send through your PayPal account will not be subject to Sending Limits although the maximum dollar amount for any single transaction is $10,000.00 USD or the equivalent thereof.""\n\nConfirming your bank account is very simple.  You just give PayPal your routing and account numbers.  They make two ""microdeposits"" into your bank account.  For example, they will deposit $0.17 and $0.05.  It will take about two days for it to show up in your account.  When the deposits are in your account, you just confirm your account by telling PayPal what the two amounts are.  They know that it is your account since you have access to the amounts.\n\nI would highly recommend confirming your bank account if you are a merchant.  As a customer, I would not send money to a non-confirmed merchant.\n\nYou still have the ability to use your credit and debit cards on PayPal.  But after you confirm your account, you also have the ability to send immediate payments from your checking or savings account."

"7","What is the cheapest way to advertise on TV?","How can a small business advertise on cable TV, local channels at the lowest price? I read in a magazine that cable TV ads can be purchased for as little as $50? Is this true?","Probably, but remember that only purchasing a few ads probably isn't a good use of your advertising dollars.\n\nThe two most important keys to effective advertising:\n\n1. Target the right demographic. What people purchase your products or services? Make sure you reach those people and not someone else. For example, advertising to business professionals during daytime soap operas while professionals are at the office probably won't be effective.\n\n2. Make sure your viewers (listeners, etc.) get enough repetitions to remember your ads. If someone sees your TV ad just once, odds are they won't even remember it. It takes a few viewings before people start remembering your ads. Try to make sure that when you purchase an air plan, your average viewer will receive at least 3 impressions (more are better), otherwise, you will likely be throwing your money away.\n\nAmongst various advertising media, outdoor (billboards) and radio traditionally have a lower cost per impression than TV, so they may be better deals for you.\n\nIf you do think you might be interested in TV advertising, talk to sales reps from your local TV stations and cable system(s). They should be able to develop air plans for you that target the demographics you are looking for.\n\nTV sales reps can also generally suggest commercial production companies that do affordable work. And they may even have special programs for new advertisers to make producing your first ad more affordable.\n\nIf you talk to several sales reps, you should be able to get a good deal simply by comparing prices. Just make sure that you're comparing apples to apples. You should be comparing the CPM (cost per thousand impressions) not the overall cost of running ads, or the number of ads being run. And you should make sure that the CPMs you compare are for the same demographic, for example, women 18-34, or people 25-49, income above $50,000.\n\nWhatever you decide your target demographic is, make sure all your CPM estimates from sales reps reflect those demographics and not some other numbers that the station thinks is more favorable to them. Some demographics are much cheaper to reach than others, and you will not be comparing equivalent pricing if you don't look at an identical demo.\n\nHope this helps. :-)"

"2","what makes a yawn?","why do we yawn?","No one knows for sure. But there are many theories (ideas) about why people yawn. \n\nOne is that when we are bored or tired, we just don't breathe as deeply as we usually do. As this theory goes, our bodies take in less oxygen because our breathing has slowed. Therefore, yawning helps us bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood. \n\nYawning, then, would be an involuntary reflex (something we can't really control) to help us control our oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Sounds good, but other studies have shown that breathing more oxygen does not decrease yawning. Likewise, breathing more carbon dioxide does not increase yawning. Hmmm. Now what?\n\nAnother theory is that yawning stretches the lungs and lung tissue. Stretching and yawning may be a way to flex muscles and joints, increase heart rate, and feel more awake. \n\nOther people believe that yawning is a protective reflex to redistribute the oil-like substance called surfactant (say: sur-fak-tunt) that helps keep lungs lubricated inside and keeps them from collapsing. So, if we didn't yawn, according to this theory, taking a deep breath would become harder and harder - and that would not be good!\n\nBut there is one idea about yawning that everyone knows to be true. It seems contagious. If you yawn in class, you'll probably notice a few other people will start yawning, too. Even thinking about yawning can get you yawning. How many times have you yawned while reading this article? We hope not many!"

"5","i have alot of amateur piucs that i have taken of my lady friends. what are the legalities of selling them?","what are my right as the owner of the photos to display them on the internet for a fee?","BE CAREFUL!\n\nThe rules have changed drastically in the US regarding adult content. It's a little code passed and made more strict in the last 5 years called Title18, 2257. In a nutshell the code states that you must keep documentation for any model in adult situations. If you post the photos you must provide a link that tells an Attorney General and law enforcement where they can examine those documents. Take a look at some adult sites, see that link at the bottom, usually titled 2257? Well, that's what needs to be done.\n\nIf you don't comply and can't prove the models age- the punishment can be pretty harsh...prison time harsh. While there have been few prosecutions due to 2257, just wait. Alberto Gonzales has been hinting at coming down on the adult web. So, expect to hear some pretty scary stories in the next few years.\n\nMy advice, if these are just candid photos you took of your girlfriends with your digital camera and if you don't have permission or documents signed by people appearing in the photos, don't post them. You really have no rights to post them. Without that written permission and age verification, they are for your photo collection only."

"2","Why are the cyanates & sulfonates not as toxic as the other compounds of cyanide?","","This is because the CN (cyanATE) is not in an ionic form (cyanIDE).

However under severe conditions (ie burning, thermal decomposition) cyanates can decompose to give cyanide."
"2","Is there an efficient way to deconvolve a gaussian blur kernel to recover the underlying data?","I have a regular 2D grid of points that have been blurred by a Gaussian kernel and then sampled using an irregular grid.  Is there an efficient algorithm for deconvolving the kernel to recover an approximation to the underlying data?","One simple method is to take the fourier transform of the blurred image and the kernel. No divide transform of image by transform of kernel. In spatial domain this can be done by convolving the blurred image by the inverse of the kernel matrix.\n\nBut from textbooks on image processing, it becomes evident, that even if one has the actual kernel that was used to blurr the original image, it is difficult to reverse the process exactly.\n\nMoving on to a bit more advanced level, one can apply Minimum Mean Square Error filtering also known as Wiener Filtering. Disadvantage with the simple method shown above is that it does not always compensate for the noise produced in the image. This is were Wiener filter provides better results. It is based on objective of finding an estimate ""est_I"" of the original image I, so that mean square error between them is minimized. This error becomes\n\ne^2 = E[(I - est_I)^2]\n\nwhere E[] is the expected value of the argument.\n\nIf you search for practical implementation of wiener filter then I am sure you will find answer to how to actually implement it.\n\nI hope this was the answer you were looking for."

The culture is also very different from what we're used to, while other cultures aren't really all that much different.  I wouldn't take it personally, people make fun of other people that are different.  Once they get to know you they'll probably joke even more, but joking around is how many people get along and should be taken lightly.

"2","How far do you think humans are to acheiveing light speed travel?","","It is impossible to actually go at the speed of light because in the formula for time dialation (That's right Velocity distorts time. The faster you go, the slower time goes for you. This effect is negligable unless you are going very close to the speed of light.) if v(velocity) were equal to c(the speed of light) you would have a zero in the denomonator.\nthe formula is:\nt'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t' is the time that has passed from a stationary observer, t is the time that has passed for you, sqrt means square root and ^2 means squared. As you can notice, when v is small, since c^2 is so huge, you get a miniscule decimal, and 1 minus that number is basically as small as 1.0000000000001 or something, and so time is not really affected. As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time actuall slows down for the object moving at such velocities. This formula is correct, it is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, and I have had to derive it myself from ordinary mechanics formulas. \n\nAlong with time, length contracts and mass expands by the same factor.  If you were to go close to the speed of light, your mass would increase and length would decrease. This means that the density of your body would increase more and more as you went faster and faster, and your blood eventually wouldn't be able to flow anymore and your cells would die of oxygen starvation.  Not that it really matters, because to even begin witnessing this effect, you would have to be going at least 90 or 95% or so the speed of light.  \n\nNow to answer your question in that is it actually physically possible to get close... considering they have particle accelerators stories high and miles long requiring tremendous amounts of energy in order to even get tiny protons and neutrons to move at such speeds, it doesn't seem like they're anywhere near accelerating something big anytime soon.  F=ma, meaning in order to get something that weighs one gram, like a paperclip to accelerate to the same degree as they do the protons, you would need about 2x10^24 times the force.  That notation just means a 2 with 24 zeros after it.  The reason for this is that that is how much more mass a paperclip has then a proton.  An actual human isn't going to get anywhere close for a very long time."

However, no in the end what path you choose is exactly that, your choice. I know of people who have grown up to believe what their parents do, and then totally change the opposite way. I personally feel that there is no right political party. I could vote either Democratic or Repub, it makes no difference to me. Who ever I feel will get the job done the best."

It raises funds by collecting deposits from businesses and consumers via checkable deposits, savings deposits, and time deposits. It makes loans to businesses and consumers. It also buys corporate bonds and government bonds. Its primary liabilities are deposits and primary assets are loans and bonds.\n\nThis is what people normally call a ""bank"". The term ""commercial"" was used to distinguish it from an investment bank. Since the two genres of banks no longer have to be separate companies, some have used the term ""commercial bank"" to refer to banks which focus mainly on companies."

You know used to bars, work, and church were the places to meet girls or guys, but with sexual harassment being an issue in the work place and church attendance down, the Internet is fast becoming a place where others can meet people. And like the previous person said, after they meet you online they usually want to meet in real life...because face it, online communications get a bit boring and lonely. In your case, I'd be upfront and tell them that you are only interested in online friendships not meeting in real life. If they can't handle it, then dump them before you start becoming good friends."
"5","How much Megabyte does the Internet have ?","","Considering that most computers connected online have hard drives with 20,000 or more megabytes (20 gigabytes, accounting even for somewhat older systems), the number is pretty huge.\n\nDue to the sheer number of people online and such, it's pretty hard to say.  However, I've seen simple networks with over 100 terabytes, or 100,000,000 megabytes of information.  With how many of these there are in the world, As of 1997, over 3,000 terabytes (3 billion megabytes) of information was simply transferred over the internet per month.\n\nNeedless to say, the Internet is much, much larger now.  So, to answer your question, it's a lot.  I'd guess that by now, the Internet has trillions of megabytes flowing through it each month."

"7","I am in a dead end job, should i get a higher payng job further away or ask for a pay raise?","higher paying job adds 1 hour and need for second car. Current pay diff = 6k","I think you're asking the wrong question.  But here goes...\n\nQuick math:  If the other job is 50 miles further away, and your car gets 25 miles to a gallon, it'll take you 4 gallons of gas per day to commute the difference in the distance between the two jobs.  At $2.25 per gallon, buying 4 gallons of gas, working 250 days per year, it will cost you $2250 more in gas alone, just to commute.  Assuming your $6K will be taxed at a ""marginal"" tax rate of about 40%, you really are only getting $3600 more (take home).\n\nSo the far away job is going to be worth about $1350 per year (which is $3600 minus the gas costs), which is nowhere near the cost of a car (payments, insurance, maintenance, etc).  (Not to mention the stress of that much driving!)\n\nNot sure if my assumptions are correct, but that should give you a mathematical way to look at it.  Basically, if my assumptions are correct, you should NOT take this job if you are looking for short-term financial gains.\n\nHOWEVER, like I said, you are asking the wrong question.\n\nIf the current job is truly ""dead end"", then it's time to look elsewhere.  You really need to be looking out for the next 5 years when it comes to a job.  And remember, this is NOT a decision between just these TWO jobs... there are a lot of jobs out there, and I'm sure that there are non-dead-end jobs that are closer to home.\n\nWhat you should do is to evaluate what an ideal job looks like that you are qualified for.  I think that  being close to home should be one criteria (especially if transportation is an issue).  But look for something that has a 5-year possibility of growth.  Not that you need to be CEO in 5 years, but can you grow, and increase pay, and learn and be positioned for an even better job?\n\nThen conduct an aggressive, thorough job search.  That could be the subject of another question.  But you want to be in a position where you are deciding between two or three GREAT jobs, and then you're doing it right!\n\nNo dead end jobs.  Ever."

Originally, Bolivia used to belong to the peruvian ""virreynato"", but it was severed by Bolivar wishes. Since then, Peru didn' have any borderline with Chile, while Bolivia did. Time after there was a saltpeter boom worldwide. Saltpeter was used for agriculture. Bolivia had saltpeter and so did Peru, but not Chile. Then started the 1879 war. Chilean historicians say that the war started for other reasons, but peruvian an bolivean say that the reason was the saltpeter.\n\nPeru and Bolivia had a treaty: In case of being attacked any of those, the other would militarly help the other country. It was a terrible war. Bolivia was defeated and abandoned the war and lost all it's coast (that's why Bolivia does not have a sea). But the war still went on and Peru stood alone fighting. Peru was inferior militarly speaking and lost the war and land too. Chilean soldiers conquered Lima and started to destroy the cities they conquered.

"4","is a criminal justice a lawyer that goes to court and defends people?","is like what is the diference between pre law studies, criminal justice, law, advanced legal reaserch,coparative law and international law.","Haha, no - criminal justice refers to the field of study that examines crime as a social phenomenon, and traditional focuses on the agents, procedures, and systems that societies create in order to deal with crime.\n\nPre-law studies are just that; they are tracks that some universities offer for those who want to go to law school and who may (or may not) know what area of law they want to get in to.

The bank can additionally file a suspicious activity report on any cash deposit that it deems to be suspicious.  For instance if you come in every day and deposit 9000 dollars, they are going to get suspicious.  The government won't ask you questions but you are required to disclose all income to the IRS, and if they do audit you and find through CTRs and SARs cash deposits you could be in trouble. \n\nHowever if this is an irregular deposit then it is not too much to be concerned about.

"7","octavian emperor?","","Octavian was the great nephew and adopted son of Julius Caesar. After the assassination of Caesar, Octavian and Mark Antony shared power. Unfortunately, Antony fell in love with Cleopatra when he was already married to Octavian's sister. So, that partnership ended badly (for Antony and Cleopatra) and Octavian was left at the apex of power in Rome, to rule alone. In 27 B.C., he became the first (and many would argue, the best) Emperor of Rome. He's better known by the Senate-given name Augustus. He ruled the Empire until his death in 14 A.D."

Although, this one, I mean, Yahoo! Answers may be a something new on Yahoo part but it is not expected to reveal such results as Google Earth has resulted in. Morover, with the introduction of more an more features in Yahoo Messenger, it has become less and less reliable so that it sometimes shows you online even if you are not really. So, as of now, I rate Google as better than Yahoo."
"6","Does the ball have to break the goal line for a touchdown to be awarded in the NFL?","","Acoording to NFL.com\n\n1.   A player with the ball in his possession scores a touchdown when the ball is on, above, or over the goal line. \n\nThat is the best direct answer relating to scoring touchdowns on their website.  As long as the ball crosses the goal line while the player has possession of it before his knee hits the ground, its a touchdown."
"5","Did you learn anything new about CSS when you were developing Gothika?","","Absolutely, yes. At the time, I was right in the middle of our University's site redesign, and literally learning CSS one rule at a time as I was going along. I actually never intended to enter any of my designs to the Garden; even though it was still in its infancy, it already featured such high quality entries that I felt my meagre attempts would be quite inadequate. As CSS was fast becoming the most popular topic in the web design area over at Sitepoint's forum (were I was a moderator at the time), we decided to run our own 'garden-like' competition. I was involved in the contest's organisation, and developed two example designs: the default Sitepoint style, and the slightly more elaborate 'Gothic'. \n\nImagine my surprise when, out of the blue, Dave Shea emailed me to ask if I'd like to rework 'Gothic' as an entry to the Zen Garden. It was this initial vote of confidence that pretty much took the 'fear' of the Garden from me and spurred me on to explore a variety of new techniques and styles, pushing my knowledge of CSS further than the constraints and boundaries of my large Salford redesign would have allowed. \n\nCertainly working on 'door to my garden' (which seems to be my most successful entry, even managing an appearance in Dave and Molly's book 'The Zen of CSS Design' - see the sample chapter at creativepro.com) has provided me with a very strong grounding on the various issues involving the use of background images and cross browser alternatives, and probably represents my most 'finished' piece of work in terms of striking a good balance between visual design and clean, simple stylesheet usage. \n\nFor completeness' sake, it may also be worth mentioning that I have two more entries which unfortunately did not quite make it into the 'official' list: phonephreak in the 'conceptual designs' category, an admittedly unreadable design that mimics a double page spread magazine layout, and an advanced version of 'door to my garden' under 'special effects', which uses some :hover trickery in browsers that support it, yet degrades gracefully in those that don't."

Unless you have a DVD burner and iso burning software you will not be able to create an installation DVD.  It is also hit or miss as to whether the software key has been cracked.  Sometimes you will get one that has and sometimes you won't.  If you get one that hasn't been cracked you will be unable to install it.  There are ways around it, none of which I approve of.  But, I'm not going to analyze the legal ramifications here.\n\nYou will also need a torrent download manager such as BitLord.

It is free, and they will even send you free CD's if you can't download it for some reason (if you are asking a question here, I assume you are already online).

According to fundementalist christians the world was created 4000 years ago. The are even building a museum in America which shows Dinosaurs living side by side with humans. THIS IS NOT CORRECT AND IS INSANE TO BELIEVE. There was a programme on the BBC on this museum a few days ago which showed one of those big horned dinosaurs with a sadlle on which gave me a good laugh!

First step is to get a USB cable that fits the phone. I've put the first search hit I found in my source as a reference but I've never used them have no affiliation.  \n\nAssuming you have a USB hub or available connector on your PC. \n\nBefore you connect depending on the OS you're running you may have to install USB software specific to the phone (again have to check the manufacture first).  But normally you'll be ok and can continue to the next step.\n\nPlug the cable into the available USB slot, and the phone.  \n\nDepending on your OS you should get a new Drive or some pop up.  Again every OS is different here.  If your on mac you'll get a new drive connection on XP you'll get a new drive in the explorer.  Either way you'll be able to drag and drop files to and from your phone now into the predefined folders provided by your phone manufacture.  \n\nDepending on your phone you may be asked for permission on the phone to move files say yes or enter in the same code on both machines if it asks for a entry code to pair up permissions.  \n\nPersonally I went with Bluetooth connectivity for the phones easier than carrying cables around but that's another discussion."

It would take too many factors for the Texans to get him:  \n- Houston already has one win and have a chance of getting another vs the Jags who looked terrible against the 49ers on Sunday. \n- Although the 49ers got one of their two wins vs St Louis, the chances of them doing it twice in one season are minimal. \n- Let's say both the Texans and 49ers lose this week. Fast forward to the Bush bowl - the Texans will probably win. They're a better team. The only way the 49ers could lose getting Bush is if they miraculously beat Houston, then it gets handed to the league to determine difficulty of both team's matchups.\n\nShort answer: 49ers have about a 75% chance of getting Bush."

"5","There are many arguments and speculation about Wikipedia being a credible source of info. What od you think?","","Wikipedia has implemented a structure of trusted moderators that cover subject areas they are relatively familiar with. So it really isn't true that just anyone can edit an entry without a hitch. It is especially hard to do for popular entries. I know my friends have tried to create entries of a 'biography' on themselves. They were legitimate and honest, however they were shortly removed, in part because they didn't have any links which seems to add validity to an entry. \n\nWith that all said, I personally have found it to be a very useful resource. Any Encyclopedia could be accused of being biased an inaccurate, but with Wikipedia it can be discussed, flagged as being biased, and edited for changes all on the fly. \n\nSo all in all, I would say that it is credible enough for most uses. However if you absolutely need a resource that would withstand scrutiny, perhaps you ought to go elsewhere. But the I think that the future is bright for Wikipedia and I hope they continue to grow and progress without being hindered by more lawsuits."

The ratios are ""avogadro's number of atoms""/mol (definition of mol) and grams/mol (unit of periodic table). Short answer: divide the periodic table weight by avogadro's number. 1 mol of K weighs 39.0983g/(6.02214199 × 10^23)=6.492 x 10^ -23 g per individual atom of K.  The averaging was already done for you in the periodic table.  Most students round to 6.022 x 10^23."
"5","what is an electronic ink?","","From what I have read about it and the referenced websites:\n\nFor nearly 2,000 years, ink on paper was the only way to display words and images, and it still beats computer displays when it comes to portability and price. Paper also doesn't require an external power supply. Yet it does have some limitations: Once you've printed words on paper, those words cannot be changed without at least leaving some marks, and it is also difficult to carry around a large number of books.\n\nTwo companies are simultaneously developing similar electronic inks -- E Ink of Cambridge, MA, and Xerox in Palo Alto, CA. At first glance, a bottle of electronic ink looks just like regular ink, but a closer examination shows something much different. Although the two companies' products vary slightly, here are the three components of both electronic inks that give them the ability to rearrange upon command:\n\n    * Millions of tiny microcapsules or cavities\n    * An ink or oily substance filling the microcapsules or cavities\n    * Pigmented chips or balls with a negative charge floating inside the microcapsule \n\nElectronic ink can be applied to the same materials that regular ink can be printed on. In the case of a digital book, the pages would be made out of some kind of ultra-thin plastic. The ink would cover the entire page, separated by cells that resemble the cells on graph paper. Think of these cells as pixels on your computer screen, with each cell wired to microelectronics embedded in this plastic sheet. These microelectronics would then be used to apply a positive or negative charge to the microcapsules to create the desired text or images."
"4","how many protons and newtrons are in magnesium?","please answer!!! =-]","Magnesium is listed in the periodic table as having the following properties:\nSymbol: Mg\nAtomic number: 12\nAtomic weight: 24.3050\n\nThe atomic number is the same as the number of protons. The atomic weight is the number of protons plus the average number of neutrons found in magnesium nuclei in nature (with a small correction mostly due to the fact that the binding energy of the nucleus is included in its mass via E=mc^2). Most naturally occurring Magnesium atoms (about 80% of them) have 12 neutrons, while 10% have 13 neutrons and 10% have 14 neutrons. The different numbers of neutrons indicate the different isotopes of Magnesium. The chemical properties of Magnesium depend (nearly) entirely on the electrons, and therefore depend on how many protons there are, and not how many neutrons; add extra neutrons and it's still ""Magnesium"", but it may weigh more. A handbook of chemistry and physics lists all isotopes with between 8 and 16 neutrons. All except the three naturally occurring isotopes are radioactive and decay to other nuclei. \nhttp://van.hep.uiuc.edu/van/qa/section/Everything_Else/The_Elements/20021026080623.htm \nThese links will help you understand the concepts more nicely.\nhttp://www.crocodile-clips.com/absorb/AC4/sample/LR303.html\nhttp://van.hep.uiuc.edu/van/qa/section/New_and_Exciting_Physics/Inside_the_Atom/982893827.htm"

So we didn't exactly undergoe this evolution for knowledge. So what we are seeing might be a highly altered version of the universe around us and there may not be a constant truth. So how can we be sure that our perception's right about time and space and work on the field based on the human opinion and vision of the universe?","the formulas are what convince me.  I've had to derive so many complicate formulas myself, and most of them, especially mechanics formulas can be proven, such as measuring a quantities, solving for a missing variable, then doing an experiment and getting the same answer.  This is too much to be a coincedence or something.  Most theories and things are developed before formulas and actual mathamatical relationships are found, then they find them and it all fits together nicely.  Even with reletivity and things with spacetime, there are a lot of concrete formulas, and once you have the satisfaction of deriving them yourself from previously proven formulas... it all clicks nicely, that's why im a physics major, curiosity about everything like this.  I guess human perception can be valid once connections start being made between things, because when ideas are incorrect, they really don't connect to other things very easily."

"9","If a girl says I'm not interested emotionally, but likes to spend lots of time with you- what does this mean?","I have a girl that I'm interested in and have disclosed my feeliings to her- and despite knowing all of this she just wants to hang out with me but doesn't want to enter in a relationship. Does it actually mean she's interested? (She's willing to hold my hand and go on vacations with me, but nothing has happened between us. ( What should I do?)","Unfortunately, what this means is not that the girl is interested (right now) but that she is being a little bit selfish.  If you are young, this is natural.  She enjoys having someone to hang out with and go on vacations with but that doesn't necessarily reflect on her feelings for you.  If she was interested than she would not be WILLING to hold your hand, but rather would be looking forward to any type of contact with you.  Her memories are more of what she has done or where she has gone, rather than of you.  However, in the future she could develop feelings for you.  If you want to know how she feels about you, try spending time with her with limited entertainment.  Just invite her over to listen to music and talk.  If she is interested in you, this will appeal to her and if not, she will decline until you present a more tempting offer like going on an awesome vacation.  Good luck."

Its a historical fact, Iranian King Koorosh after conquering Babylon rescued a group of Israelis that was prisoned there, his name is in Jews holy book(the last part I have heard from a Jew friend)\n2. Lots of famous Israel leaders born and grew up in Iran, want a sample? Netaniaho\n3. Jews live freely in Iran, no one do any harm to them, they are accepted as a god based religion and they are free to do they rituals and business, even send money to Israel if they want to, they can leave Iran and go Israel but they don't\n4. Iran and Israel haven't done anything against each other, maybe cursing is the worst act\n5. Although everyone think Iranian is Arabs Iranian are not arabs and they almost hate them specially because of what they have done when conquered Iran, so Iran and Israel have a common enemy\n6. Israel have done anti Iraq operations many times, Iraq was Iran enemy(they were in war for years)\n7. Iran Nuclear program was at progress for years, Israel could do an operation when Iran was really weak(After Iran-Iraq war exactly at the time they attack Iraq)\nMaybe they yell at each others but they totally love each other ;)\nMany hidden strings in Iraq and Middle east are in Iran hands, although Neo Conservatism theories which are at progress specially by UK urges that Israel needs peace and UK is the leader of Middle east politics from old times.\nSo decide yourself, these are the facts that I know."

"10","Why are republicans generally against birth control, against wellfare, but supportive of the death penalty?","","Many Republicans are Christians. Certain variations of Christianity are opposed to birth control because they feel that sex should only be used for reproduction (hence the song ""Every sperm is sacred"" from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life).\n\nFeelings against wellfare generally revolve around the idea that people should be responsibie for their own lives. In the US, people have a lot of freedom and opportunity available to them. With this freedom comes responsibility. People who spend most of their lives on wellfare usually are choosing not to do things to improve their lives (I know this firsthand. My mother was on wellfare until I was 16).\n\nThe other aspect of wellfare is individual rights. If you lost your job, do you have the right to go into someone's house, hold a gun to their head, and make them give you ""unemployment compensation?"" Obviously not. Wellfare recipients are paid with tax money. Tax money is obtained in the same manner. (Have you ever tried to NOT pay taxes?)\n\nThe death penalty is a little more complicated. There are plenty of non-republicans who are in favor of the death penalty. The thought is usually that the person ""deserves"" it and should not be a burden on society by consuming valuable prison resources."

I have owned many companies ranging from manufacturing to software. I have always found the financing part confusing with regards to one issue: Is it possible to do a private placement to raise funds from accredited investors without utilizing a broker dealer? For example,...can a company take a 2 step approach such as the following: 1) create a general ad campaign dispersed to the general public and then ""filter out"" accredited investors 2) once the accredited investors have been qualified they are then presented the opportunity by employees of the actual company raising the money. I ask this question because of my last company. I started the company with $1200, and in a few years grew it into cash flow of $10MM, and yet still was unable to attract VC financing. I did not want to go the public route yet still wanted the ability to raise funds for additional growth.

"10","Why did Bush go AWOL from his guard duty during the Vietnam war?","","In 1972, four years into his six-year guard commitment, he was asked to work for the campaign of Bush family friend Winton Blount, who was running for the U.S. Senate in Alabama. In May Bush requested a transfer to an Alabama Air National Guard unit with no planes and minimal duties. Bush's immediate superiors approved the transfer, but higher-ups said no. The matter was delayed for months. In August Bush missed his annual flight physical and was grounded. (Some have speculated that he was worried about failing a drug test--the Pentagon had instituted random screening in April.) In September he was ordered to report to a different unit of the Alabama guard, the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in Montgomery. Bush says he did so, but his nominal superiors say they never saw the guy, there's no documentation he ever showed up, and not one of the six or seven hundred soldiers then in the unit has stepped forward to corroborate Bush's story.\n\nAfter the November election Bush returned to Texas, but apparently didn't notify his old Texas guard unit for quite a while, if ever. The Boston Globe initially reported that he started putting in some serious duty time in May, June, and July of 1973 to make up for what he'd missed. But according to a piece in the New Republic, there's no evidence Bush did even that. Whatever the case, even though his superiors knew he'd blown off his duties, they never disciplined him. (No one's ever been shot at dawn for missing a weekend guard drill, but policy at the time was to put shirkers on active duty.) Indeed, when Bush decided to go to business school at Harvard in the fall of 1973, he requested and got an honorable discharge--eight months before his service was scheduled to end.\n\nBush's enemies say all this proves he was a cowardly deserter. Nonsense. He was a pampered rich kid who took advantage."

"5","item in My Documents says Application-delete or uninstall?","My Documents contain Zone Labs (firewall) Applications duplications. Are they merely files that can be deleted or are they applications that I must uninstall (they are not listed in Add/Remove Programs)?

"7","ETF's or Mutual Funds?","I'm shooting for long term gains. In a pro's eyes, which is better to start off with and why?","Assuming you're talking about indexing...\n\nETFs generally have lower expenses, but you buy them like stocks & pay comissions.\n\nMutual funds have higher expenses, but you generally don't (or shouldn't) pay fees to get into them.\n\nIf you're looking at periodically (say each payday) adding to the investments, mutuals may be cheaper since you don't pay comissions each time.\n\nIn the long run, an ETF that mirrors the same index as a mutual fund will be cheaper because the fund expenses keep eating away at your returns."

"4","Whats the answer to 7 11/12 - 3 5/8?","","First you have to take the 7 11/12 and 3 5/8 and change them into unmixed fractions (no whole numbers).  To do that you multiply 7 times 12 and then add 11.  That is your new numerator (7*12 + 11).  The denominator is still 12. (so 95/12) \n\nDo the same thing with 3 5/8 (3*8 + 5). (so 29/8)\n\nNow  you need to find a least common denominator so that you can subtract 29/8 from 95/12.  8*3 = 24.  12*2 = 24.  So 24 is your least common denominator (note that 8*12 is also a common denominator but not the LEAST common denominator).\n\nChange each of the fractions so that you have 24 as the denominator.  Then do the subtraction."

"1","discusss the assertion that man is the enemy of culture?","","Depending on your definition of ""man"" and ""culture"", this statement could be interpreted that man creates change in terms of stylistic development, by always breaking away from existing norms.  \n\nHowever, I personally believe that a statement like 'man is the enemy of culture' invites more nonsensical arguments than anything else, and is merely a distraction from any real discourse about either man or culture.  People using this distraction generally don't have any facts to back up what they're talking about.  It's very easy for them to say that 'man is the enemy of culture' because once stated, they can lump nonsensical points and random thoughts on top of that assumption, and to the casual listener sound intelligent."

Over his tenure as President, though, his administration and the Department of Justice largely ignored federal obscenity law.  I've included a link to Morality in Media, an anti-pornography group that expressed its disapproval of the Clinton administration's lack of action in federal obscenity crimes, noting that in 1997 only 6 obscenity prosecutions took place, and in 1998 only 8.\n\nClinton agree with Congress in certain pornography controls, tightening virtual child pornography regulations under the Child Online Protection Act in 1998.  The bill was later struck down by the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds.\n\nAll in all, Clinton was verbally nominally opposed to pornography, lax in most areas of enforcement, and compliant with Congress in tightened protection for minors."

It was not compiled into one book until after his death though. After he Died, The rulers made sure when they compiled the Quran that every verse they got through a trustworthie person and he had to have 2 witnesses that heard the Prophet say that verse.\n\nThe significance of Mouhammad not being able to read or write, means that he couldnt have been able to come up with such PERFECT words.

"9","How can I get back together with my ex-wife?","Our split up was due to a really bad situation. No adultery involved. However the tust was shattered!","Not knowing the details, it is tough to answer, but there are various types of women out there, and for some, trust is everything. If you did enough to make her leave you, it must have been pretty bad. I would assume (since I don't know the circumstances) that either there have always been trust issues, or that your infidelity (of whichever type) was long standing and ongoing, and so she felt betrayed. In both cases, I don't know if there is anything you could do. If she left because of pure emotional reaction, you might have a chance, but if it was an intellectual decision, it is not likely to work. Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with, but logic is usually rock solid.  You could offer therapy for you both, however if you are already 'divorced', it seems a little too final to try that. Apologies alone won't really get you anywhere. Not much of an answer, but without any details, it's the best I've got. My main advice though is to know when to give up. Some battles can't be won. At some point, you might have to just count your losses, consider this an expensive learning experience, and don't make the same mistake next time."

The resonance structures are just to give you an idea as to where the electrons might wander over to.\n\nTechnically, all the Lewis structures are just to help you understand the charges.  In reality, the elecetrons are constantly moving about, with their locations only localized by a probabilistic model.  The formal charges are indicative of the highest probability that a given electron will be found, while the resonance structures are the less probable locations to find the electron."

The A&R department is the link between the recording artist/act and the record label, and is often required to handle contractual negotiations, find songwriters and record producers for the act, and schedule recording sessions.\n\nOne of the A&R department's main jobs is sorting through the plethora of demo tapes sent by hopeful musicians to the label.

My cousin's son, who is four, loves ""Godzilla"". My favorite movie when I was a child was ""Dirty Dancing"".\nAnd what about the classic children films, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Wizard of Oz"", or any Disney film.

"8","movie based on 3 brothers in prison & is a type of western where 1 brother is a butcher?","the warden of the prison also helps them escape to do jobs for them","It is the hard word\n\nFirst-time director Scott Roberts gets it pretty right with this inyaface Aussie crime caper about three brothers who are just too good.at what they love best: robbing banks.\n\nGuy Pearce leads the Twentyman brothers as sort of mastermind Dale. He’s in jail and Rachel Griffiths is his unlikely moll wife who seems to be in bed with conniving lawyer Frank (Robert Taylor). \n\nThe scam is simple. The boys get snuck out of jail to pull their heists and everyone from the cops to the prison governor are cut in. Until Frankie decides he wants it all, including the lady- and there’ll be no witnesses.\n\nIt’s funny, black and rather surreal. Naturalism buffs will not adore this as much as looser-limbed viewers. But it’s helter-skelter action and remarkably little violence. Strong language though as you’d expect from a writer whose other film was the batty Denis Hopper vehicle The American Way in 1987.\n\nOne lovely touch totally misunderstood by almost every critic so far is the family argot based on butcher’s slang which the lads use to keep their personal stuff, er, personal.\nIf you could handle Chopper you will like this and ignore the spoilsport bourgeois critics of the national press when they come to savage it!"

Then they would give us a check, I would use the check to buy books first and then the rest was history! I used it for whatever. The reason you get financial aid is so that you can survive throughout the semster and pay for classes. After the classes are paid for that money should be used for books, clothes, school necesities, food, rent etc. \nI always would get my check buy books, then have a couple rent checks make out  ( cashier checks) and then use the rest for stuff I needed. Sorry my answer is so long. As always with anything check directly with your school before listening to me on yahoo! Good luck!"

"2","Does temperature increase or decrease when Snow Falls?","Mind you, the question is not so obvious. And please do tell why.","Before it begins to snow, the system begins to cool the air down to ground level.  As this happens, moisture in the ground moves up into the weather system, and eventually mixes with the already cold water, ect within the cloud.  As the snow begins to fall, the temprature drops for a short period of time, and then stabilizes. \n\nThis stabilization happens so that the snow can continue to fall without turning into ice.  On average, winter snow will fall between 14 F and 30 F.  However, it is possible for snow to fall at lower tempratures, however you will see an increase in temprature to have snow fall.\n\nNot all snow falls, however, fall within that temprature range.  Area's such as alaska, greenland, siberia, ect, can have snow even when it is much much colder.  However, the general rule still applies:  snow fall equels an increase in temprature untill a stabilization point has been reached.\n\nSnow that falls within the normal range is usualy wet snow, ie it is snow that is mixed with a bit of melted snow (water vapor), thus causing it to be heavy snow.\n\nSnow that falls below the temprature range tends to be dry snow, ie, snow that has completely frozen over.\n\nDry snow can be a major problem as it doesn't allow for the stabilization to occure at a quick rate, instead, blizzards, huge snow storms, ect, can take effect before the storm system actually stabilizes.\n\nHope that made sens&#92;e"

As the leader of the United States during arguably the most difficult time of our history, he pushed Congress to pass emergency bills and reform measures that helped improve the economic situation in the eyes of the public.

"5","Why does Dell customer service suck so bad?","Their customer service is the worst in the business and they don't realize it. I have bought 12 computers from them and now I'm abandoning them. If they would have changed, my mindset would be different, but they REFUSE TO CHANGE, so I will.","Just as a note to the last individual: yah, Canadians ARE so freakin nice, Dell does not outsource to Canada (has Dell-owned call centers in Canada), and many of the call centers in India are, also, not outsourced.\n\n Maybe your question could be more specific. What happened? WHY are you abandoning Dell? I work for Dell's DOC department, in a NON-OUTSOURCED Canadian call center, and I know Michael Dell cares A LOT about what his consumers think. He will often monitor calls himself or even take calls. \n\nMost large companies, espically those that outsource, have a difficult time controlling ALL of their employees and making sure they are representing the company as a concerned and understanding individual. To handle the flow of calls, so you are not waiting hours to speak to someone, requires a great deal of man-power; the more people you have between the top and the front line, the more difficult it is to ensure everyone is upholding your principles. How far did you go with your experience? Maybe you should try writing to Michael Dell to let him know your concerns. \n\nI find, at least as far as technical support, that some customers have expectations that are unrealistic. Many people think that because you bought -insert the name of any software product made by another company here- with their computer, that Dell should provide support for it. Think about it, if you buy Norton Antivirus from BestBuy, do you complain to them about Norton not working and expect them to fix it? Not likely. you contact the manufacture who is specialised in it. Many people have problems with their systems due to spyware and adware programs, but dont know they need to install anti-spyware software and do not recognise the symptoms. My question is, where you looking for free assistance with a DELL MANUFACTURED PRODUCT? \n\nI am not speaking on behalf of Dell here, but meerly my own experiences and how I look at our service. I would, at least, suggest contacting Michael Dell prior to giving up on Dell completely. I know that we DO hear feed back from him regarding both positive and negative customer experiences.\n\nPS: I have worked for other major comuter manufacturers and I must say Dell is NOT the worst in the industry, by far. The most important statistic agents are graded on here is customer experience, not call time as it is for most (forcing customers through as fast as possible to take more calls)."

This is largely because it responds to wounding by producing more latex. Other plants containing latex include figs (Ficus elastica), euphorbias, and the common dandelion.""\n\nMore at source link."

But to my understanding, global warming increases the average suface temperature of earth...How does it change the climate?","Though it may sound crazy, global warming can cause an Ice Age. You see, there's an underwater wall keeping the super-cold water of the Arctic Ocean out of the a lot warmer water of the Alantic Ocean. Global warming makes this wall dissolve, letting the cold water meet the warmer water, overall lowering the temperature of the oceans. Meanwhile, the glaciers start to melt and slide. Now that the oceans aren't as warm, the glacierscan continue to move south and cover a chunk of the Northern Hemisphere in ice. In short, an ice age.\n\nHowever, ice cores are showing that global warming isn't as bad as we thought. the ice cores show that the average global temperature 100,000 years ago would go up and down by 10 degrees in a matter of decades. In comparison, our global warming is warming at a rate of 1 degree per century. Is global warming going to cause the next Ice Age? Or are threats empty? YOu decide."

"3","are chiropractors real doctors?","","Doctors of Chiropractic receive extensive, demanding professional education on par with medical doctors (MDs) and osteopaths (DOs).\nTo receive the doctor of chiropractic degree, candidates must complete extensive undergraduate prerequisites and four years of graduate-level instruction and internship at an accredited chiropractic institution. Comprehensive knowledge of all systems of the body and diagnostic procedures enable the DC to thoroughly evaluate a patient, address disorders relating to the spine and determine the need for referral to another health care provider.\n\nDoctors of Chiropractic are primary health care providers.\nAccording to the Center for Studies in Health Policy, ""The DC can provide all three levels of primary care interventions and therefore is a primary care provider, as are MDs and DOs. The doctor of chiropractic is a gatekeeper to the health care system and an independent practitioner who provides primary care services. The DC's office is a direct access portal of entry to the full scope of service.""\n\nDoctors of Chiropractic are licensed in all 50 states.\nDCs have been licensed and recognized for many decades in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\nChiropractic is recognized by governmental health care programs.\nChiropractic is included in Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Care Benefits Programs, Federal Workers' Compensation and all state workers' compensation programs. Chiropractic students are qualified to receive federal student loan assistance and DCs are authorized to be commissioned as health care officers in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe practice of chiropractic is based on sound scientific principles.\nThe existence of the nervous system as the primary control mechanism of the body is an undisputed scientific fact. Its relationship with the spine is the focus of the practice of chiropractic. The spine develops in utero to provide two primary functions: (1) allow for freedom of movement and (2) house and protect the spinal cord. When the vertebrae of the spine become misaligned through trauma or repetitive injury, two major consequences will result: (1) the range of motion becomes limited and (2) spinal nerves emerging from the spinal cord are compromised. DCs use the term ""subluxation"" to describe such disruptions. Interruption of nerve flow can eventually lead to pain, disability, and an overall decrease in the quality of life. Conversely, the removal of that interference has been shown to have significant, lasting health benefits. Through the adjustment of the subluxation, the doctor of chiropractic endeavors to restore normal nerve expression. The body is then able to respond appropriately to any imbalance in the system, thus relieving symptoms and restoring health.\n\nDoctors of chiropractic provide effective, low-cost health care for a wide range of conditions.\nStudies conducted according to the highest scientific standards and published by organizations not affiliated in any way with chiropractic institutions or associations continue to show the clinical appropriateness and effectiveness of chiropractic care. One of the most recent, funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health, stated emphatically that:\n\n""On the evidence, particularly the most scientifically valid clinical studies, spinal manipulation applied by chiropractors is shown to be more effective than alternative treatments for low back pain...There would be highly significant cost savings if more management of low back pain was transferred from physician to chiropractors.""\n\nThe doctor of chiropractic is an effective source of preventative and wellness care.\nThe anatomical focus of the DC on the human spine has created the perception of the DC as just a ""back doctor."" Although this perception is not entirely incorrect, it is very much incomplete. Doctors of chiropractic are a highly appropriate resource in matters of work-place safety, st"

"3","What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex (oral and vaginally)?","What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex (oral and vaginally) with a woman who is HIV positive or AIDS.    How do those odds change over time?  In other words, one sexual encounter versus multiple?","The following numbers are old, and they're all pretty much guesswork anyway, so take them with a grain of salt.  But I venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.\n\nAccording to a report by researchers Norman Hearst and Stephen Hulley in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with AIDS after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million. With a condom it's even safer--one in 50 million. Just to put this in perspective, the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million (source: The Odds on Virtually Everything, Heron House, 1980). You're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning (1 in 600,000), having your house bombed (1 in 290,000), or being murdered (1 in 11,000).\n\nThe numbers get a lot worse if you engage in ""high-risk behavior""--having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group, e.g., a gay or bisexual male or IV drug user from a major metro area, or a hemophiliac. The chances of getting AIDS from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected. Even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high--1 in 50,000 without a condom. That's because there's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative. (A few people go as long as 180 days.)\n\nFrom there on out, statistically speaking, things deteriorate pretty fast. If your partner is HIV-positive, your chances of getting AIDS after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom, 1 in 500 without. Have sex with an HIV-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11. Skip the gift wrap and they're 2 in 3.\n\nA couple points: These odds apply equally to men and women. Although there's reason to believe male-to-female AIDS transmission happens more often than female-to-male, the amount of difference is unknown. Also, I have to emphasize again, the numbers involve a lot of guesswork. The authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction. Still, one message comes through loud and clear: by far the best thing you can do to avoid AIDS is to be picky about your partners. Use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10, sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50, but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000. (You'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior, such as unprotected receptive anal sex.) Asking for a resume may not be romantic, but it beats Kaposi's sarcoma."

Here is their website: http://mission.depaul.edu/ombudsperson/index.asp\n\nExplain your problem to the ombudsman and they can probably help you solve this problem.

It is an inherited condition resulting from the combination of recessive alleles passed from both parents of an individual. This condition is known to affect mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. While the most common term for an individual affected by albinism is ""albino"", most of them prefer ""person with albinism"", because ""albino"" is most often used in a derogatory way.\n\nRegarding Pigmentation:\n\nIn biology, pigment is any material resulting in colour in plant or animal cells which is the result of selective absorption. Some biological material has so-called structural colour, which is the result of selective reflection or iridescence, usually done with multilayer structures. Unlike structural colour, pigment color is the same for all viewing angles. Nearly all types of cells, such as skin, eyes, fur and hair contain pigment. Butterfly wings typically contain structural colour, although many of them contain pigment as well. Creatures that have deficient pigmentation are called albinos."

However, as a secondary goal, customer care might actually care. For example, if the customer care manager is given a goal of increasing customer satisfaction and is provided with the appropriate resources, you might actually experience customer care that cares."

Beyond the tree-line, they are unable to grow due to inappropriate environmental conditions. There are several types:\n\nArctic tree-line The furthest north in the Northern Hemisphere that trees can grow; further north, it is too cold to sustain trees. \n\nAntarctic tree-line The furthest south in the Southern Hemisphere that trees can grow; further south, it is too cold to sustain trees. \n\nAlpine tree-line The highest elevation that trees can grow on mountains; higher up, it is too cold to sustain trees. \n\nExposure tree-line On coasts, and on isolated mountains, the tree-line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because high wind speeds adversely affect tree growth. \n\nDesert tree-line The driest places that trees can grow; drier desert areas having insufficient rainfall to sustain trees. \n\nWetland tree-line The wettest ground on the margins of muskegs and bogs that trees can grow in, below which the ground is too saturated with water, excluding oxygen from the soil that tree roots need to grow. \n\nHowever no such line exists for swamps, where trees, such as Bald cypress and the many mangrove species, are adapted to growing in permanently water-logged soil."

It's the same concept as having lets say a piece of paper, and cutting it in half.  You take one half and I take the other. Now you want more, so I give you half of my piece, which is 1/4 of the whole thing, so you have 3/4.  Now, you want even more, so I cut my piece in half again and give it to you.  I could keep cutting my piece in half and giving it to you, but you would never ever have the whole piece of paper because each piece I'm giving you means less and less, the denominator of my fraction would keep doubling, so I would always have something.  I hope this helped you understand.  \n\nYou sound like me in 10th grade, well minus the cars.  just the general music(well, i was a band geek :p) and science in general, then I got to 11th grade and discovered physics.

"1","I believe in giving back. What are some good places to volunteer my time?","Soup kitchens, shelters, beach cleanups?","Organize a group of people together to feed the homeless that are in the street. There is such a homeless problem in California and not enough shelters to help all of the homeless. There are a few different people/groups of people I have witnessed that have made it their business to make hundreds of sandwiches a day and pass them out to the homeless. There was a lady in Los Angeles who would cook great healthy homemade soups and drive around to the different spots where she knew the homeless people would gather and she made sure they had something good to eat as regularly as possible. But sometimes people can't do that on such a grand scale and it still makes a big difference on a smaller scale sometimes. Just giving something to a homeless person - a warmed plate of your leftovers from dinner perhaps - is a great thing.\n\nWalk up to a homeless woman who is minding her own business, not begging off of anybody, and give her 10% of your weekly income. I met a man one time who did that because he no longer attended church and it was his form of paying tithes. See how big that woman's smile gets. Depending on what you make, you might be able to divide that among 10 homeless women and still get great, surprised, thankful, almost wondrous expressions of happiness.\n\nVolunteer to mentor or assist a homeless person who is not totally beyond help. There are plenty of homeless people out there who look beyond help. Homelessness is a battle of hopelessness. The longer a time a person remains homeless, the more hopeless they feel about everything. People who have been homeless for more than a year become ""The Chronic Homeless"" and their chances for being able to escape the confines of homelessnes are statistically decreased. Sometimes people just need an address for employment opportunities, a contact phone number for messages, encouragement, food, a safe place to store clothing and personal belongings. When homeless people don't have at least these meager advantages, it can be intensely difficult to make it back into a more normal type of living environment.\n\nBecome a mentor or a Big Brother.\n\nVolunteer to tutor children or speak to children to motivate them to study well so they can become a graphic designer or whatever they want to achieve.\n\nDonate some of your graphic design services or discount as a donation to help non-profit charities advertise events that can help them achieve their goals.\n\nCounty hospitals often welcome volunteer administrative help.\n\n(Just a few ideas - I could go on forever with this. So many worthy causes out there need volunteeristic people.)"

Ed. 2d 723; 1964 U.S. LEXIS 994\n\n \nMarch 25-26, 1964, Argued  \nJune 15, 1964, Decided\n\nPRIOR HISTORY: \n\nCERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS. Aguillar v. State, 172 Tex. Crim. 629, 362 S.W.2d 111, 1962 Tex. Crim. App. LEXIS 1114 (Tex. Crim. App., 1962)\n\n\nDISPOSITION: 172 Tex. Cr. R. 629, 631, 362 S. W. 2d 111, 112, reversed and remanded.\n\nSUMMARY: A Texas justice of the peace issued a warrant to search for narcotics in defendant's home; the warrant was based on an affidavit filed by two municipal police officers and reciting that affiants received reliable information from a credible person, and that affiants believed, that narcotics were being kept at defendant's premises for illegal sale and use. Over defendant's objection, heroin seized under the warrant was introduced in evidence at his trial in a Texas state court. Defendant was convicted of illegal possession of heroin, and his conviction was affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. (172 Tex Crim 629, 362 SW2d 111, affirmance upheld on rehearing, 172 Tex Crim 631, 362 SW2d 112.)\n\nOn certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed. In an opinion by Goldberg, J., expressing the views of six members of the Court, it was held that under the Fourteenth Amendment the heroin was not admissible in evidence because the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause, the standard for obtaining a search warrant being the same under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nHarlan, J., concurred in the Court's opinion, stating that but for Ker v California, 374 US 23, 10 L ed 2d 726, 83 S Ct 1623, in which case he dissented, he would have affirmed the judgment of the Texas court.\n\nClark, J., joined by Black and Stewart, JJ., dissented, expressing the view that the majority substituted a rigid, academic formula for the unrigid standards of reasonableness and probable cause laid down by the Fourth Amendment.\n\nLAWYERS' EDITION HEADNOTES: \n \n [***HN1] \nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §27\nwarrants -- showing of probable cause -- judicial review --\n \nHeadnote: [1]\nIn passing on the validity of a search warrant, the reviewing court may consider only information brought to the magistrate's attention; hence, the fact that the police may have kept a suspect's house under surveillance is irrelevant where, in applying for the warrant, the police did not mention any surveillance.\n \n [***HN2] \nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §5\nrestrictions on states -- warrant -- standards --\n \nHeadnote: [2]\nThe standard for obtaining a search warrant is the same under the Fourth and under the Fourteenth Amendment, through which the Fourth Amendment's proscriptions of unreasonable searches and seizures are enforced against the states.\n \n [***HN3] \nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §26\nconstitutionality of search warrant --\n \nHeadnote: [3]\nIn evaluating the constitutionality of a search warrant, the rule is that the informed and deliberate determinations of magistrates empowered to issue warrants are to be preferred over the hurried action of police officers who may happen to make arrests.\n \n [***HN4] \nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §25\nwithout warrant -- justification --\n \nHeadnote: [4]\nThat facts known to police officers would constitute sufficient evidence to justify the issuance of a search warrant will not justify the officers in making a search without a warrant.\n \n [***HN5] \nSEARCH AND SEIZURE §27\nshowing probable cause -- judicial review --\n \nHeadnote: [5]\nWhere a search is based upon a magistrate's, rather than a police officer's, determination of probable cause, the reviewing court will accept evidence of a less judicially competent or persuasive character than would have justified an officer in acting on his own without a warrant, and will sustain the judicial determination of probable cause so long as there was substa"

There are plenty of Witches here and no stores to get everything for your spells and reading.  How do I go about opening one.  I recently got an inheritance and I would like to put that money up to start the business.  I have $75k, is that enough?  I also have good credit.","When we first opened the Copper Cauldron, which we had in Jacksonville Oregon, we invested 75k total into the business.  We did quite well and moved our store to St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nGeneral guidlines, find a good wholeseller, and do your research.  Don't just sell products, provide a service, such as readings, and such to give to your customers.  Help them with research, educate them if necessary.  Hold workshops and classes as well.\n\nTo help make your adjustment into the community acceptable, to avoid the problems we had (broken windows, broken down door, ect), aggree to educate and hold workshops on the various pagan religious types to the general community.  Hold free sessions, ect to offer people.  \n\nBest to spend on good quality store furniture.  Best to buy quality items and sell at a decent price.\n\nGet listed on WitchVox.com  Great place.\n\nAdvertise, and join the BBB in your area.  Also consider joining your local Chamber of Commerce.\n\nI reccomend setting up your hours for what is available and done within your community.  So if most stores are closed on monday, close yours on monday as well, so that you don't provide a commerce shock to the area.\n\nKeep in mind that you are not going to be considered a niche shop, indeed not.  You are a community shop, that is a shop that is available throughout the year.  One that doesn't close or dwindle after the tourist season. \n\nKeep in mind also, that you need to provide an open and safe environment for your patrons.  There should be no tolerance for harassment, ect of your patrons out in front of your shop, or in your shop.\n\nI reccomend carrying some form of New Age book shop/section for your store.  The reason for this is that people like to read, they like to learn.  And the more they read, and the more they come in to buy/return books, the more face you recieve per day.\n\nWe started a library program for our store, and did wonderfully!\n\nCheck out places such as azuregreen.com and look at their wholesell program, they are great.\n\nCheck out stores and suppliers in canada, as well, as they provide great products for cheap.\n\nConsider hosting local merchants, ect, within your shop.\n\nMain steps:  Get your state business licence from your secretary of state.  Get your city license if needed.  \n\nFind a good location, open your store.  Get some form of security.  Make sure you don't need a security permit from your local police department to operate a security system.\n\nGet some form of security camera system in y our store, this helps cut down on losses due to theft.  Trust me it will happen.\n\nFind an open minded land lord.  Don't go with one who is 'unsure' but go with one who likes the idea of a pagan store in the area.\n\nDO NOT CALL YOURSELF A WITCHCRAFT STORE.  Absoutly not, you are a Pagan Resource Center, or a Pagan Store.  The reason for this is that 'witchcraft' no matter what spin you put on it, will have a negative connotation to those around you in your community.  However if you are a Pagan store, or Pagan Resource Center, you have much more credibility.\n\nJoin local stores in intitiaves, and such to get your name out there.  Help with local planning of events for your community.\n\nLastly, advertise as best you can.\n\nIf you need more help, please email me, i'd be more than willing to help you setup :)"

Originally a Roman province, the area was conquered from the 3rd to the 12th century by a succession of invaders, including Goths, Huns, Magyars, and Mongols. In the 13th century two principalities, Moldavia and Walachia, emerged, becoming vassal states within the Turkish Empire and eventually Russian protectorates. They were united in 1861 and became independent in 1878. The rise of fascism in the 1930s led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a dictatorship in 1940. Following Romania's surrender to the USSR during World War II, the country was declared (1947) a communist republic, which was overthrown in 1989 with army-supported countrywide revolts. Bucharest is the capital and the largest city. Population: 22,300,000 ."

"7","WHO GOT THE IDEA OF INTERNET?","","During the 1950s, several communications researchers realized that there was a need to allow general communication between users of various computers and communications networks. This led to research into decentralized networks, queuing theory, and packet switching. The subsequent creation of ARPANET in the United States in turn catalyzed a wave of technical developments that made it the basis for the development of the Internet. Contrary to popular myth, the DoD did not create the ARPANET so that they could communicate to the US Government after a nuclear war.\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational in 1984 when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nThe collective network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN in Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN in Switzerland. In 1993 the Mosaic web browser version 1.0 was released, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word ""Internet"" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network."

"2","what are the advantages of antibacterial products?","","Antibiotics are a valuable tool for fighting bacterial infections which persistantly do not resolve with your body's own Immune System.\n\nAntibacterial products have been touted to reduce infection from exposure to things you touch, wear, etc.  This is valuable for some people with compromised immune systems, but the normal healthy person really has no need for such products.\n\nIn fact, the use of those products and antibiotics are creating stronger more resistant bacteria in our environment.  With stronger more resistant bacteria comes the risk of NOT being able to get rid of an infection when one occurs.  \n\nExamples of resistant bacteria are MRSA and VRE.  These are very difficult infections to fight BECAUSE of their resistance.\n\nSo, to recap, most of the time exposure to bacteria will actually increase your immune systems ability to FIGHT that bacteria later and using too many products to kill bacteria can actually, in the end, hurt us."

How come?","When sitting for long times, say, in an airplane flight, wearing loose clothes, especially socks, is recommended to prevent blood clots. Yet, to prevent clots, when confined to a hospital bed, very tight fitting socks are provided. Seems inconsistent. Any ideas?","First, I find the first post to be offensive, and if you dont know the answer just dont give it!\n\nSecond your answser - blood clots are caused from the stagnant flow of blood which does not return to the heart.  Unlike your arteries which have alot of muscle in them, your veins rely on compressions of skeletal muscle to return blood back to the heart.  If you are not moving your feet or legs, blood pools and can clot while it is sitting there.\n\nThe tight socks in the hospital compress the skeletal muscle which help blood to return back to the heart.  In flight, your legs can swell, thus tight socks would contrict blood flow and possibly make swelling worse.\n\nNo matter what socks you wear, just do ankle exercises and all will be well! :)"

Some people have tried to get rid of dark matter with new theories of gravity - this is essentially what you're proposing - but thus far it never really works out."

The local university here loads it's operating system fresh every time you reboot the computer.  It is very fast.\n\nAlso a key point to note:  Since the virus writers know what their virus infections do, they also know the best way to restore and fix the damage.  I'm sure a lot of virus writers test their viruses and only fix the parts that the virus broke. This would save them the most time.\n\nPS: If I ever meet a virus writer, I'm going to kick him/her in the nuts and call the cops.  That shit is wrong.

To give you a strict answer, I would say that Ju-jitsu can hurt more because you'd still be alive to feel the pain.

"2","Why do dogs and cats have red eyes in photographs?","","Same reason humans have red eye -> Flash light that is sent directly to the retina (parallel to eye level) is reflected off the blood vessels at the back of the retina, hence the red color.\n\nPerhaps you see it more in dogs and cats because they reflect more light off their retina, thats how they manage to have better eye sight than humans."
"5","How do I save audio file after adjusting speed? (Using Windows Media Player 10)?","","The speed adjustment in WMP is a playback effect, and can't actually be saved, as WMP is just a player. You need some kind of sound editing program for it to save. You can use Windows Sound Recorder, depending on it's format. However, you will have better luck with a program like Sony Sound Forge. (Sound forge might actually be made by a subsidiary of Sony, so it might not actually say Sony, I just know it by that name)"

"5","What are pass by reference and passby value?","","classic example\nSuppose you want to write a function to exchange the values of two integer variables. It seems like that would be fairly trivial. For example, to swap x and y, you could just create an extra int variable, t, and write code that looks like this: \nt = x;\nx = y;\ny = t;\nThat would certainly work. (Try giving x and y initial values & trace through the code if you don't see why the code works. Note that this approach is similar to what you did for the mandel() function in that programming assignment.)\n\nSo, you would probably suppose that you could write a function like this:\n\nvoid swap (int x, int y) {\n      \n   int t = x;\n      \n   x = y;\n   \n   y = t;\n}\nNow, suppose your main() looks like this:\n\nint main(void)\n{\n   int a = 5;\n   \n   int b = 7;\n      \n   swap( a, b );\n      \n   printf(""a is %d and b is %d&#92;n"", a, b);\n      \n}\n      \nWhat will print? If swap works, we expect ""a is 7 and b is 5"" to print. But what actually happens? When the function swap is called, the values of a and b are passed into the functions. When swap begins, x is initialized to 5 and y is initialized to 7. The values of x and y are swapped...but the values of a and b (in main) are unaffected. The swap function does not work as written above because the arguments were passed 'by value.'\n\nWith pointers, we can pass the values 'by reference.' Passing by reference means that we'll pass the addresses of the variables instead of the values. Here's how swap and main should be written:\n\nvoid swap ( int *px, int *py) {\n      \n   int t = *px;\n      \n   *px = *py;\n      \n   *py = t;\n      \n}\n      \nint main(void) \n{\n   int a = 5;\n   \n   int b = 7;\n      \n   swap( &a, &b );\n      \n   printf(""a is %d and b is %d&#92;n"", a, b);\n      \n}\n      \nNow, the addresses of the variables a and b are passed into swap. In swap, t is set to the value of 'the data that px points to', which is just the value stored at the address of a, which is 5. Then the value stored at address px is changed to the value stored at address py. This sets a to the value of b. Finally, b is set to the value t, which was the value originally stored at a. So, the values of a and b were swapped."
"3","what is upper gi endoscopy?","I have been suffering from an abdomenal pain for two years now , I wa asked to go for UPPER GI ENDOSCOPY .What is it?","A doctor inserts a tube into your mouth, and runs it through your esophogus, through the stomach, and into the duodenom (upper intestines). The doctor then can detect polyps, damage, tumors, etc, and he can also biopsy troubled areas. You will be required to be on a liquid-only diet for 24 hours, and then you can eat or drink nothing after midnight before the procedure. You will also be given laxatives to clear out your digestive system completely.\n\nFor the procedure, you will be given a spray to numb your throat and gag reflex. You will also be given a medication that will make you relaxed but you will still be awake during the procedure. The doctor will need you to help get the tube down. \n\nThe whole thing takes about 30 minutes. You won't be able to eat until the numbing spray wears off. Good luck!"

"2","How can the force of elastic orthodontic bands be measured?","","The force exerted by an orthodontic band can be measured by first calculating its force-constant.  It can be done in the following way:\n\n(1) Hang a single, unstretched, orthodontic band from a string.\n(2) Along side the band, place a measuring ruler and carefully note and record where the bottom part of the band starts.  This will be our starting point.\n(3) Next, hang a couple of known weights such as paperclips, fishing sinkers, etc, and note how far the band stretches with the given weight attached.  Perform this task for, say, 5 to 10 different weights.  Don't forget to measure and record how far the band stretched for each weight you hang from it.\n(4) Now, using graph paper, make an x-y plot of the data.  Mark how much weight was used (y-axis) and how far the band stretched (x-axis).\n(5) Through these data points, a straight line can be drawn which has a calculated slope.  This value of the slope, k, is your force-constant.  Don't worry, this will make sense in a minute.\n\nTo calculate the force exerted by the band, use the following equation: F = kx, where F is the exerted (restoring) force, x is the distance the band stretched, and k is the force-constant we calculated.\n\nViola!  There you go.\n\nDepending on the material, the force-constant k will be different.  This was why we had to go through steps (1) to (5)."
"2","When we are travelling in a bus, we feel the speed. But, why are we not able to feel the speed of earth?","","It is true to say that you cannot feel the ""speed"" (velocity) of a bus when moving at a constant velocity - - but only in a ""perfect"" universe - - i.e., no ""contact"" between the bus and its environment. In reality, you probably perceive high velocity versus low velocity due to changes in vibration, bumps in the road, ""wind"" whistling, motor engine noise of the bus, etc.\n\nNot only is the earth moving at ""constant"" velocity (technically, its velocity is decreasing at an extremely low rate; slowing down only as measured over billions of years) - - its ""interaction"" with its ""environment"" (in solar system space) is virtually zero."

Bone which is very dense has either a blood supply (marrow) or is bathed in nearby blood supplying needed oxygen.  Young caisson workers (building tunnels under rivers at elevated air pressure) were prone to bone embrittlement if depressurized too fast too often because expanding nitrogen from their denser bone ends prevented fresh oxygen from entering thus causing bone necrosis.  Teeth have a blood supply unless you have had a root canal (0ouch!).  Parts of the eye have poor blood supply and no veins and need oxygen from the air.  The body can take in about 10% of the oxygen needed through the skin."

"10","what is the cutoff date for selective service?","in other words, when can i stop worrying about being drafted?","You are required to be registered with the selective service between the age of 18 and 25. However if a draft were to be constituted in the US, current selective service reforms suggest that a lottery would be held with young men turning 20 up first. \n\nThe likelihood of being drafted in the US depends on many factors. First and foremost is the need for more soldiers. With the current situation the US is in, it remains unlikely that a draft would be issued. However world events could quickly change that. \n\nAll in all, you can never fully ""stop worrying"" about being drafted. If a crisis were to warrant it, anyone (traditionally only males) could be drafted. It would start with those turning 20 within that year, and spread out to affect those young down to 18 years old and upwards toward 25. Local draft boards would be the deciding body as to whether you were to be drafted or not if you fell within the age specifications. If the need were there, those older than 25 could also be drafted."

But his favorite method was impalement on stakes, hence the surname ""Tepes"" which means ""The Impaler"" in the Romanian language. Even the Turks referred to him as ""Kaziglu Bey,"" meaning ""The Impaler Prince."" It is this technique he used in 1457, 1459 and 1460 against Transylvanian merchants who had ignored his trade laws. The raids he led against the German Saxons of Transylvania were also acts of proto-nationalism in order to protect and favour the Wallachian commerce activities."

Playing games with your friends where you make a bet or dare someone to ask someone out is a common way to get through the immobilizing fear that goes along with letting someone know you are interested in getting to know them.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this.

Even if you are rejected or get embarassed, you will be giving yourself terrific experiences as well as important practice. Right now, dating is simple and fun. You have nothing to lose. The day will come when you will be interested in a very serious relationship and without getting to know what kind of risks you can take now, you might miss a truly important opportunity in the future.\n\nBe safe, smart, and have fun!"

"2","Do plants feel?","Do plants have nervous responses (of a sort) similar to those of animals?","Bose was a leading physicist of his age and pioneered the investigation of microwave optics in the late 1800s. He made the first public demonstration of radio communication and is also credited with proving plants have nervous responses similar to those of animals.\n\n\n--Indo-Asian News Service\n\nFor clarifications/queries, please contact IANS NEWS DESK at \n2616-5778/8546, 2617-3369 or mail us at\nsupport@eians.com\nDr.J.C.BOSE\n \n \n \nChallenges\n\nWhen anything new is discovered, there will always be people who question it. The results of Bose's work, too, were not accepted by all. There were people who challenged them and even said that there was not much truth in them. Bose gave a lecture at the Linnean Society next year to a gathering of scientists. He explained with suitable experiments how plants respond to stimuli. Even those who had challenged him could not find fault with his experiments or conclusions.\n\nThere is an interesting story about a demonstration that Bose gave in England. On that day he wanted to show some new things that he had found out. He had come to the conclusion that plants can feel pain like animals; that when we pinch them they suffer; and that they die in a few minutes after they are poisoned. Bose wanted to show experiments to prove these conclusions. A number of scientists and other leading men and women had gathered to hear him. Bose started the experiments by injecting poison into a plant. The plant should have shown signs of death in a few minutes. On the contrary, nothing happened. The learned audience started laughing. Even at this adverse moment Bose showed admirable calmness. He thought quickly. The poison that he injected into the plant did not kill it. So, he supposed that it would not hurt him also. With full confidence he got ready to inject the poison into himself. At that instant a man got up and confessed that instead of poison he had put similar colored water. Now, Bose conducted the experiment again with real poison, whereupon the plant withered and died as expected.\n\nJagadishchandra Bose continued his work and made new discoveries. He found that plants shrink a little during the night. He found out why plants always grow towards light even if they have to bend. He also found out the reason why some plants grow straight and some do not. He explained that this was due to the 'pulsation' in plants. This pulsation quickens by heat and slows down by cold in plants.\n\nJagadishchandra Bose did remarkable work, - and scientists outside India had honoured him. Yet there were people who opposed him. As a result even the Royal Society delayed publishing his valuable work in its publications, But nothing could make him give up his work. He was sure that years of research had led him to the truth. So he did not feel that it was very necessary to depend on scientific journals only. He wrote books and published them on his own.\n\nBy this time Bose had made a name for himself as a great scientist. The instruments he had developed were being used in some Western countries too. He visited Europe and America in 1907 and 1914; scientific institutions invited him to explain his discoveries. He visited Japan also.\n\nMost of us have seen a peculiar kind of plant called the mimosa (touch-me-not') which spreads on the ground. It has very small leaves. It is extremely sensitive. If we just touch one leaf, that leaf and the leaves nearby all fold up. The greater the force we use, the larger the number of leaves which fold up. The whole row of leaves of the branch can be made to fold like this by touching it with a little greater force. Why does only this plant react like this? We have often wondered, haven't we? Bose wondered, too. And he went on to find out. He found that other plants also react to a man's touch in the same way. The only difference is this: We cannot see the reaction of other plants but we can see the reaction of the mimosa. But Bose wanted to study th"

It is a ""legal right or interest that a creditor has in another's property, lasing usu[ally] until a debt or duty that it secures is satisfied - Typically, the creditor does not take possession of the property on which the lien has been obtained.""\n\nYou're getting ahead of yourself here, though.  Depending on state law, you'll need to have a formal lender or creditor relationship before you'd be able to attach a lien.  Also, much depends on whether the loan is recourse or non-recourse - was this a debt to the person, or to the property?\n\nRegardless, your first action should be to go to small claims court and file a claim against the debtor.  Contact your local district court in whatever state you're in, and ask them about the maximum ceiling for a small claims action.  Determine from there where you'd be able to bring you case, and then whether you'd need to consult a lawyer.\n\nEDIT: For a debt of $10,000, you need to consult an attorney and explain the situation.

The initial version deployed by SECA was known as SECA I and in May 2002 this was replaced by SECA II. In July 2003 Canal Plus Technologies was acquired by Thomson and in turn in January 2004 the business was acquired by Nagra. \n\nSKY Italia was formed on 1 May 2003 by the merger of Telepiu and Stream. At that time Stream operated with the encryption systems Irdeto, SECA and NDS. SKY ceased operating the Irdeto encryption system in February 2004. \n\nPresently, SKY has more than 2.5m digital customers. Of these, 1.9m utilise SECA decoders and the remainder use NDS decoders. SKY anticipates it will replace approximately three-quarters of the 1.9m SECA decoders currently deployed, with the remainder requiring only a new smart card. \n\nExisting SKY SECA subscribers will be progressively converted to NDS transmission, commencing from may 2004. In some cases this will be done by SKY providing a new NDS smart card which will operate in existing SECA decoders, but for many subscribers SKY will be delivering an NDS decoder and smart card to the subscriber's home at no additional cost. \n\nAt this time SKY subscribers using a SECA enabled decoder need to take no action: SKY will contact each subscriber directly during the next six months to advise if it will supply them with a new decoder or a new smart-card. \n\nSKY's CEO Tom Mockridge said: ""To ensure ongoing security of transmission and to achieve the efficiency and stability of a common software platform it is necessary to use only a single encryption system and SKY has chosen NDS to be its single encryption system in the future"". \n\nThis decision means from 13 June SKY will stop selling subscriptions that use the SECA card. To provide an opportunity for potential subscribers currently owning or wishing to purchase a SECA enabled decoder, SKY is making a special offer for ""smart card only"" subscriptions from April 28 until 13 June. For subscribers using credit card or RID payment method the special offer will include the first month's subscription free of charge (on all packages). The usual activation fee of EUR 59 will continue to apply and all smart cards sold will need to be activated prior to 30 June. SKY accepts the obligation to provide an NDS decoder and smart card to all customers accepting this offer at the time SECA transmission is terminated. \n\nFrom 14 June, after this special offer finishes, SKY will no longer sell subscriptions which use SECA enabled decoders. All new customers will be supplied with a NDS enabled decoder. \n\nA.

If he is really a 'good' (though struggling) Jehovah's Witness, there are many many reasons he might feel uncomfortable to accompany you during holidays with your family.\n\n1. He may still feel bad a little bad about 'fornicating' with you, and certainly doesn't want to look your family in the eye while they 'know'.\n\n2. Participation in Christmas celebrations by a Jehovah's Witness is considered 'apostasy', a sin much worse than fornicating.\n\n3. Loving you is a heart thing; it may be easy for him and others (like his mom) to understand that ""sin"". On the other hand, decking the halls (etc) is NOT an emotional urge, and maybe neither he nor his mom (he guesses) could excuse that decision even in their own minds\n\n4. His background may cause him to feel genuinely offended at the commercialism, inaccuracies in Christendom's version of Christ's birth, the pagan origins, the unscriptural traditions and the hypocrisy too often associated with Christmas.\n\nLet your boyfriend know that he is welcome to come (if he really is), but that you understand and accept his decision to stay home."

The total ion content of endolymph is significantly higher than that of perilymph."

It is good to take a break right?","Maybe what you need are some new friends, not necessarily leaving the ones you have. Just broaden your circle of friends. A circle of friends should include at least one who keeps you on track...one who will always be straight with you and tell you when you're being stupid. You should be able to know that you can tell your friends anything, and it won't get broadcasted all over the city...trust. You should be able to have fun with your friends and have shared interests. That doesn't mean you always agree with everything they say. It means that you like some of the same things they like and you can do them together. Your friends should never be threatened by you bringing another friend into your circle, because your friends are like your extended family and are an extention of you. If your friends want you to be exclusive to them only, it may be time to find all new friends. No one should own your friendship. If your friends call and want to go somewhere and you don't, it should be ok to let them know you just don't feel like going out with them right now. They should be secure in your relationship that you don't have to spend all your time with them in order to remain close friends. You don't have to see your grandparents every day in order for them to continue to love you. It's the same with friends. Friendship should never be conditional, based on how much time you put into it. But, a certain amount of maintenance IS required to keep your relationship close. If you're wanting a break, it sounds like they're requiring more of you than you want to give.

If you say, ""your conscience"" then what if in someone's conscience, they believed that it was ok to hurt other people? what gives you the authority to say they are wrong? there would be no basis for the law in a completely atheist society. \n\nI'm not criticizing anoyone for not having a religion, I just want an honest answer. What is the origin of your morals? If you say it was your parents, then where did they get them from? obviously somewhere along the line, they came from some form of religion. Honestly, what is your opinion?","Being athiest doesn't mean you don't value life, I think if you value life that's enough to base morals off of your conscience.  How much you value life and living is what most laws are based on anyway so in a completely athiest society as long as the majority value life(which most would since the majority of people do) you could base the law off of that value since law isn't based on religious morals it's just based on preserving and respecting life.\n\nI'm athiest and my morals probably do come a bit from my parents, but mostly I just try to do what I feel is right.  The majority of athiests I know wouldn't deny that the morals in most religions are good things to adopt, they just don't want all the other crap that comes with the religion.  I have no problem following the golden rule, but I don't believe that I should have to scare myself into following it because I don't want to go to hell or dissapoint Jesus or whatever.  I believe that morals came before religion and that religion is just one way invented to get people to adopt the morals and to follow laws. If people are made to believe that there are eternal consequences for their actions they'll be more thoughtful before acting.  In the human society there are certain things you have to do to keep alive and to live well and they just happen to be more complicated than in the societies of other animals. The morals most of us have today are a survival instinct, we learned early on in our society that working together would help us thrive and in order to get people on your side you have to treat them a certain way and act a certain way yourself.  I think morals are more of a basis for religion than religion a basis for morals...religion needs morals but morals don't need religion."

Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\n\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal.

Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.\n\nGoogle has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.\n\nCons of Google:\n\nHowever, few problems with google, its web crawler dosen't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net, a feature which Yahoo provides.\n\nAlso, Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler, a feature which Altavista provided since 1999. The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\n\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs. Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush's name, the #1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.\n\nYahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies, for example Grokker.\n\nhttp://www.grokker.com/grokker.html?query=Anirudh%20Koul&Yahoo=true&Daypop=true&numResults=250"

"2","discuss the vibrational frequencies of SiH4 molecule?","","If you were going to discuss the vibrational frequencies of SiH4, I suppose you would want to compare it to something similar, like CH4.  Both of these molecules have 5 atoms, and are tetrahedral in shape.  That indicates that there will be 3N-6 modes, or 3(5)-6 = 9 vibrations.  The symmetry of these modes are governed by group symmetry rules, yielding an a1 stretch (1), an e bend (2), a t2 antisymm stretch (3) and a t2 bend (3), accounting for the nine modes.  Comparing to CH4, the vibrational frequencies (energies) for those modes that involve Si atom motion would be depressed due to the increased mass of Si.  An exception would be the a1 symmetric stretch as that should not involve Si motion."
"6","Tell me about the history of football?","Who invented it ? how is it played","History of Football \n From Mary Bellis,\nYour Guide to Inventors.\nFREE Newsletter. Sign Up Now! \n\nAmerican football was started in 1879 with rules instituted by Walter Camp.\nDerived from the English game of rugby, American football was started in 1879 with rules instituted by Walter Camp, player and coach at Yale University.\n\nWalter Camp\nWalter Camp was born April 17, 1859, in New Haven, Connecticut. He attended Yale from 1876 to 1882, where he studied medicine and business. Walter Camp was an author, athletic director, chairman of the board of the New Haven Clock Company, and director of the Peck Brothers Company. He was general athletic director and head advisory football coach at Yale University from 1888-1914, and chairman of the Yale football committee from 1888-1912. Camp played football at Yale and helped evolve the rules of the game away from Rugby and Soccer rules into the rules of American Football as we know them today.\nOne precursor to Walter Camp's influence was William Ebb Ellis, a student at the Rugby School in England. In 1823, Ellis was the first person noted for picking up the ball during the soccer game and running with it, thereby breaking and changing the rules. In 1876, at the Massosoit convention, the the first attempts at writing down the rules of American football were made. Walter Camp edited every American Football rulebook until his death in 1925.\n\nWalter Camp contibuted the following changes from Rugby and Soccer to American football: \n\none side retained undisputed possession of the ball, until that side gives up the ball as a result of its own violations \nthe line of scrimmage \n11 on a team instead of 15 \ncreated the quarter-back and center positions \nforward pass \nstandardized the scoring system, numerical scoring \ncreated the safety, interference, penalties, and the neutral zone \ntackling as low as the knee was permitted - 1888 \na touchdown increased in value to six points and field goals went down to three points - 1912\nThe NFL or the National Football League, was formed in 1920."

"2","Is it possible to build a device capable of time travel but wouldn't work due to the enormous power it needs?","","If you actually care, read ""Time Travel In Einstein's Universe"" by J. Richard Gott.  It actually proposes multiple ways this is possible.\n\nMy favorite which I learned in physics class is the fact that velocity warps time.  The closer you get to the speed of light, the slower time moves for you. I've read this, and it is definately true, we had to derive the formula in physics, and calculate the time, lenghth(which decreases with speed), and mass (which increases with speed) distortion as well. The new time which has passed is equal to the time passed of a stationary observer over one minus the square root of velocity squared over the speed of light squared.  The effects of this are very negligable unless you are moving at speeds very very close to the speed of light, at least over 90% of the speed of light, and we haven't gotten anywhere close yet.  But theoretically if you were traveling very close to the speed of light, you could rotate the earth for what seems like days to you and then have years pass on earth, thus in a way traveling into the future.  Also, it gets slower and slower so that it is thought that time would actually stop if you were moving at the speed of light, and so now what happens if you move even faster? Some think it might cause you to go back in time.  It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light, however in his book, Gott discusses looping around strings(the strings from string theory) which warp space time, and discusses ways to ""beat"" light and actually show up someplace before you left.\n\nTime definately slows down with velocity, therefore time travel definately occurs, however, i actually have a problem with the time travel of humans.  Because along with time dialating, mass also dialates, and length contracts, if we were to approach speeds significant enough to distort time, our mass would increase and length would decrease.  Now since density is mass over volume, wouldn't that mean that our density would increase dramatically? wouldn't our blood then become so dense and viscous that it prevents blood flow and our cells become deprived of oxygen and we die? Because of this, I find it unlikely that we will ever be able to time travel, but if we can accelerate objects enough, we will probably eventually be able to send other things into the future."

"4","Which is correct? ""He is better than me."" or ""He is better than I (am).""?","I believe ""better than I"" is correct because the word ""am"" is implied at the end of the sentence.  \n\nThank you.","The key is apparently the word ""than"". The following is a quote from American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language at education.yahoo.com. \n\n Since the 18th century grammarians have insisted that than should be regarded as a conjunction in all its uses, so that a sentence such as  Bill is taller than Tom  should be construed as an elliptical version of the sentence  Bill is taller than Tom is.  According to this view, the case of a pronoun following than is determined by whether the pronoun serves as the subject or object of the verb that is ""understood."" Thus, the standard rule requires  Pat is taller than I  (not me) on the assumption that this sentence is elliptical for  Pat is taller than I am  but allows  The news surprised Pat more than me,  since this sentence is taken as elliptical for  The news surprised Pat more than it surprised me.  However, than is quite commonly treated as a preposition when followed by an isolated noun phrase, and as such occurs with a pronoun in the objective case:  John is taller than me.  Though this usage is still widely regarded as incorrect, it is predominant in speech and has reputable literary precedent, appearing in the writing of such respected authors as Shakespeare, Johnson, Swift, Scott, and Faulkner. It is also consistent with the fact that than is clearly treated as a preposition in the than whom construction, as in  a poet than whom (not than who) no one has a dearer place in the hearts of his countrymen.  Still, the writer who risks a sentence like  Mary is taller than him  in formal writing must be prepared to defend the usage against objections of critics who are unlikely to be dissuaded from the conviction that the usage is incorrect.·Comparatives using as . . . as can be analyzed as parallel to those using than. Traditional grammarians insist that  I am not as tall as he  is the only correct form; in formal writing, one should adhere to this rule. However, one can cite both literary precedent and syntactic arguments in favor of analyzing the second as as a preposition (which would allow constructions such as  I am not as tall as him)."

For example, I can't eat and swallow my cake and then have it for later.","If you think of the ""and"" operator in grammar as a ""plus"" in math, then no--both can't exist simultaneously (well, after you poop it out I guess).\n\nAnd since people want to emphasize you not being able to have something more than the action maybe that's why they say the HAVE first."
