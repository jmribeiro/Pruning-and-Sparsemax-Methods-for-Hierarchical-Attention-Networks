"4","What is the difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree?","","One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\n\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \n\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought."
"3","Why do women get PMS?","","Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS."

"2","Do animals have a sense of humour?","As an example, would a dog dig up another dog's bone and bury it elsewhere as a joke?","Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\n\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way."

Set one at 10 O'clock and one at 7 o'clock.  Put a difuser (white paper) in front of the 7 o'clock lite (you want half the light from that one).  Use a background with a single strong color (not the same as the product) that you can select in Photoshop to delete out the background.  Support the product on a rod (stick it on using putty) that is behind the product so it does not show.  Keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus.  That's about it!"
"10","What is the U.S. Green card procedure after labor certificate approval and how much time it will take?","","This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready."

Doesn't it end up keeping people away from your website since they simply subscribe to your data and don't have any reason to visit?\n\nYes it's good that people are reading your data (blogs, etc.) but your hits go down and ad revenue dwindles if people stop coming.\n\nIsn't that what a commecial site owner would be thinking about RSS?","Yes, and some sites provide ""partial"" feeds via RSS, requiring the user to go to the site before being able to read all the data.\n\nThe argument for full feeds more or less runs like this:  You need to entice users to your site.  By providing a full feed you are giving your users what they want, and they will be more inclined to look upon you favorably.  So rather than directly forcing eyeballs to your site, you are working on the reputation of your site for quality data, and hoping the users will pass along your site to others through bloglines or deli.cio.us, and getting new  eyeballs indirectly."

That's why it is important to support your immune system. Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs, including Fructus aurantia (six percent synephrine extract), thyme, oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.\n\nAndrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures. It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “cold property” herb in traditional Chinese approaches; it is used to rid the body of “heat” and dispel toxins. Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system. Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefits: \n•  Helps the body defend against seasonal changes. \n•  Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system. \n•  Helps support mucous membrane health. \n \nPurchase Information \nSEASONAL DEFENSE (90)  \nStock No.:806-6 \nQV: 12.40 \nMember Cost: $12.40\nNon-Member Cost: $18.60  \n\n\nhttp://www.mynsp.com/lifemoreabundantlyinc/products/guide.aspx?stockNum=8066\n\n\nI definitely stand by this stuff!!!!!

"2","What color is water really?","Obviously, it would seem as if pure water is transparent, but I read somewhere that water actually has a very slight blueish tint.  I think this may have something to do with the light being bent as it passes through or something.  Sometimes you can even see a blueish color.  For example, when you fill up your bathtub several inches, you can see a slight blueish color.  Also, lakes and the ocean can appear blueish, even when the sky is not a blue color to reflect.","The absorption minimum for water is at 420 nm, well within the blue range of the visual spectrum. This means that that is the wavelength of light that it reflects the most. It does not reflect it very much, so small amounts appear transparent."

"1","Who are kurds?","","Kurds (kûrds, kʊrds) , a non-Arab Middle Eastern minority population that inhabits the region known as Kurdistan, an extensive plateau and mountain area in SW Asia (c.74,000 sq mi/191,660 sq km), including parts of E Turkey, NE Iraq, and NW Iran and smaller sections of NE Syria and Armenia. The region lies astride the Zagros Mts. (Iran) and the eastern extension of the Taurus Mts. (Turkey) and extends in the south across the Mesopotamian plain and includes the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nAs of the late 1990s, there were estimated to be more than 20 million Kurds, about half of them in Turkey, where, making up more than 20% of the population, they dwell near the Iranian frontier around Lake Van, as well as in the vicinity of Diyarbakir and Erzurum. The Kurds in Iran, who constitute some 10% of its people, live principally in Azerbaijan and Khorasan, with some in Fars. The Iraqi Kurds, about 23% of its population, live mostly in the vicinity of Dahuk (Dohuk), Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, and Sulaimaniyah.\n\nEthnically close to the Iranians, the Kurds were traditionally nomadic herders but are now mostly seminomadic or sedentary. The majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims. Kurdish dialects belong to the northwestern branch of the Iranian languages. The Kurds have traditionally resisted subjugation by other nations. Despite their lack of political unity throughout history, the Kurds, as individuals and in small groups, have had a lasting impact on developments in SW Asia. Saladin, who gained fame during the Crusades, is perhaps the most famous of all Kurds."

Also, they don't wear down as quickly. On the other hand #3 have a softer lead, giving a thicker, darker line and quick wear that requires frequent sharpening. there are even some numbers beyond that but you are only likely to find them in specialty stores, such as art supply."

"2","is gas milage better in cold weather.does gas expand giving you more.?","","Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \n\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\n\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is."
"2","why the sky is blue?","","The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue."

Here's what they have to say:\n\n""The figure behind the curtains is a ""standee"" (a stand-up cardboard cutout used for advertising displays) of Ted Danson, dressed in a top hat, white shirt, and tails. The standee prop was created as part of a story line involving a dog food commercial in which Danson's character (an actor) appears, but references to the figure were cut from the finished version of the film.""\n\n""(The standee shows up once more in the film: Ted Danson is standing next to it when the baby's mother comes to reclaim her child.) The figure was accidentally left in front of a window on the set by a propman and thereby ""sneaked"" into the background of one scene. Additionally, all indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto soundstage -- no real structures were used for interior filming."""

(see link 1) The AMD Athlon 64 and 64FX processors (links 2,3) run at higher clock speeds and have more L2 cache, providing excellent performance, but costing much more to make than Sempron.  Athlon 64 X2 is AMD's dual core CPU, providing more stable operation for tasks such as video editing."

"2","Is space infinite?","","Here's the issue:  The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite.  We can define space ""\n\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \n\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \n\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \n\nA period or interval of time. \nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers.""\n\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties.  Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty.  Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable.  If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond ""No"".  This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled.  You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc.  Not so with infinity.  Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing.  The base problem with my definition is that ""things"" and ""existence"" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception.  Infinity must be something other than that.  Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity?  Try this one, ""Infinity is all unthings non-existing"".  that's the closest I can get.  Give it a shot.  But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite."

Content is information aside from the website design and layout.\n\nContent on a website is best unique, as opposed to syndicated (taken from someone else).\n\nIf your site is uniquely written, that's good.  If it's well written, that's great.\n\nIf your site is writing about an interesting topic, uniquely written by you, and well-written, that's awesome -- That's the premisis for creating content for a good website.\n\nAlso, content can come in forms of raw data -- Like, if you wanted to make a travel site -- you can list the prices it takes to fly from Chicago to Pittsburg.  Or you can have a currency converter.\n\nAnother thing you can incorporate is a chatroom or message board for users to discuss the content and post their suggestions."

The minimal electronics are finely restrained to the point where the sparseness creates a lusher sound than the components, a flow expertly embellished by the vocal harmonies that describe unrequited wishes. Sedate drums and gentle guitar flesh out the compositions, delivering the ethereal sound into more accessible territory.\n\nComparable to the Pixies and Beck, Escape Pod's music provides a serene access to tuneage of less demanding quality, providing sonic refuge among airwaves overcrowded with harsh noise."

"7","how many people a year are affected by sexualy transmitted disease?","","Chlamydia remains the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States. In 2004, 929,462 chlamydia diagnoses were reported, up from 877,478 in 2003. Even so, most chlamydia cases go undiagnosed. It is estimated that there are approximately 2.8 million new cases of chlamydia in the United States each year\n\nGonorrhea is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States, with 330,132 cases reported in 2004. From a high of 467.7 cases per 100,000 population reported in 1975, the U.S. gonorrhea rate fell to 113.5 in 2004 (a 76% decline) — the lowest recorded level since reporting began in 1941. More recently, from 2003 to 2004, the rate fell 1.5 percent (from 115.2 cases per 100,000 population to 113.5). Like chlamydia, however, gonorrhea is substantially under diagnosed and under reported, and approximately twice as many new infections are estimated to occur each year as are reported.\n\nSyphilis: Cases Increase for Fourth Consecutive Year\nThe rate of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis — the most infectious stages of the disease — decreased throughout the 1990s, and in 2000 reached an all-time low. However, over the past four years the syphilis rate in the United States has been increasing. Between 2003 and 2004 alone, the national P&S syphilis rate increased 8 percent, from 2.5 to 2.7 cases per 100,000 population; during this time, reported P&S cases in the United States increased from 7,177 to 7,980.\n\n\nWow was that person ever guessing get the facts..."

"2","do emergency room doctors get paid a lot?","ER doctors seem to work really hard and they have to know everything, so do they get paid more than doctors with offices?","ER docs get paid slightly above average in comparison to other doctors.  However, they work shorter hours than most physicians and generally do not have to take ""call"" (in other words, once they are off work, they are off work).  They do not have to know everything, if you are comparing to doctors in other fields.  (All physicians have to know a little about every field, but no doctor knows everything about every field).  They just need to know how to recognize a wide variety of conditions that present in the ER, and know when to refer a patient to a specialist.\n\nThis is not to downplay the level of knowledge that ER docs have in comparison to other physicians.  ER docs often do well in their medical school class.  But there are other fields that are more competitive and are generally paid more (such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and orthopedic surgery)\n\nIn general, doctors working in a hospital are not paid as well as doctors in private practice.  Many, many people are treated at the hospital without health insurance (it would be unethical to turn them away).  This leaves hospitals cramped for money, so other patients' bills go up and doctors salaries go down, despite what the general public may think.\n\nAlso, when people discuss physician salaries, they often forget to factor in malpractice insurance, which has bankrupt and put many doctors out of business.  ...and yet so many people still want to sue doctors because they think they earn a lot of money."

If they will allow it, ask if it needs to be DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0 compliant as different cable services have varying requirements.  \n\nIf they provide a modem, make sure, once you receive the modem and setup your service you have them ""provision"" the modem on their network as it is likely they will have provisioned theirs already for you.  Provisioning assigns the address of your new modem to your cable connection, otherwise the new modem will not be ""allowed"" to communicate on their network.  Also, make sure to return the modem they provide, and have them cancel your rental fees!"

So is the French.  Russian is less so but I don't know a lot about the origin of Russian but it probably has more Eastern influence than Italian.\n\nEastern languages (e.g., Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, etc.) are more based in pictographic language forms (or pictures).

"5","What does AJAX satnd for?","","What Does AJAX Stand For?\n\nAJAX means 'Asynchronous Javascript and XML'. Adaptive Path came up with the term in this essay: http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php. However, the word is really a bit of a misnomer: AJAX doesn't really rely on XML at all, but rather on a Javascript function that happens to be named XMLHttpRequest.\n\nAll About XMLHttpRequest.\n\nXMLHttpRequest was originally invented and implemented by a Microsoft team who were working on a webmail application, and it's been around for a while now (since 1999, in fact). The reason it has suddenly come to prominence now is that Google used it in three projects, Gmail, Google Suggest and Google Maps, and in each case managed to create a much better user interface than they would have been able to otherwise.\n\nSo what does XMLHttpRequest do? To put it simply, it lets your Javascript go back to the server, fetch some new content, and write it back out onto the page - all without the user having to change pages. This gives a 'smoother' feel to web applications, as they can do things like submit forms without the whole browser window needing to go blank and reload the page. Take a look at maps.google.com now, and notice how you can drag the map around anywhere you want to go without having to reload the page. This would be unthinkable without XMLHttpRequest.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons XMLHttpRequest has become popular now is that browsers other than Internet Explorer have started to support it, mainly due to the fuss over its use in Gmail. The function is, by all accounts, a very simple one in technical terms: it was just a matter of someone having the idea.\n\nGetting Started with AJAX.\n\nThe first thing to do to get started with AJAX, then, is to create an XMLHttpRequest object in your Javascript code. As ever, Internet Explorer has to be difficult, doing this a different way to every other browser out there. That means that you should use this Javascript code:\n\nvar ajax;\nonload = function () {\n   if (window.ActiveXObject) {\n      ajax = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");\n   }\n   else {\n      ajax = new XMLHttpRequest;\n   }\n}\n\nWhat you've done there is declared ajax as a global variable (usable by all functions), and then created a new AJAX object when the page loads, either using ActiveX for Internet Explorer or the XMLHttpRequest function in other browsers.\n\nThe next step is to write two more functions: one to get data from a URL, and one to handle the data that comes back.\n\nfunction getText(url) {\n   ajax.open(""GET"", url, true);\n   ajax.send(null);\n}\n\najax.onreadystatechange = function () {\n   if (ajax.status == ""200"") {\n   // do things with retrieved text (in ajax.responseText)\n   }\n}\n\nAll you need to do then is call getText from the relevant part of your code with a URL you want to get text from, and put that text wherever you want it to be in the state change function.\n\nThe most powerful thing about this approach is that the URL you send to the server can contain variables, using the old REST (question marks and equals signs) way of doing things.\n\nThat means that, using the code above, you can easily send a request to ajax.php on your server, and include the current value of, say, an input box for a username on a registration form. The ajax.php script checks whether that username is already in use, and then sends either '1' or '0' as its only output. All you would then need to do is check whether ajax.responseText was 1 or 0, and change the page accordingly, preferably using getElementByID.\n\nShould I Use It?\n\nThe question remains over just how useful this is: it's certainly good for some applications where users would otherwise have to submit data over and over again, but it's not much use for smaller ones. AJAX coding has a tendency to take a lot of time, especially the first time you try it, and this is "
"5","how do I discontinue my aol account ?","","Simplest way: call technical support.\n\nWhen you call customer service and choose the option to cancel your account, you get transferred to a department called ""sales"".  Their job is to try and convince you not to cancel your account.  Their performance is based on how many members they ""save"".  Talk to them if you want to get a couple free months.\n\nIf you just want to cancel without the sales pitch, call technical support.  They have access to cancel your account and would be very happy to do so because their performance is based on call time."

"7","How can I accurately determine the P/E ratio and forward P/E ratio of ETF's investing in foreign indexes?","Also, which ETF's that invest in country specific indexes have the lowest P/E ratio's?

Then add up all the earnings per share times the number of shares. Then divide those two numbers. \n\nThe forward P/E you would have to estimate NOT only what those companies will make next year, but what the companies  are added and what are dropped.

The physical nature of muscules will not scale up like that. The strongest one could get is, well, as strong as the strongest human, whoever that is.\n\nThe web material seems fictional as well.

Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).\n\nThe second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about."

Try moving it all over.\n\nConfigure the wireless part of the router to use a different channel.  Perhaps the default channel is already being used in your area or is just really noisy.  There are channels 1-11 to choose from.  (Again this is on your wireless router configuration)  If it is on 1, change it to 6 or 11.  If it is on 11 change it to 1 or 5.   If it is on 4-6 try either 1 or 11 and see which ones are better signal.\n\nKeep in mind that the signal strength isn't the only measurement...make sure it doesn't drop the signal.  An okay signal that is stable is better than a great signal that drops out from time to time (which can happen)\n\nWhen ""tuning"" your antenna position, keep in mind that walls might have metal in them that causes interference too.  Try to provide ""line of sight"" when ever possible between wireless devices.  Glass is fine.  Maybe putting your antenna closer to the window if you are trying to get the signal somewhere else in the house... or putting it closer to a hallway so there is less physical material between the two places."

Version 1.5 of Firefox offers a few notable features, foremost of which is the ability to reorder tabs by dragging and dropping them. You'll also find a tool that lets you quickly clean up your surfing history with two clicks of the mouse or a hot-key combo. The latest iteration of the browser seems more responsive than it has in the past and also is more efficient; with 10 windows open, Firefox consumed slightly less RAM than either IE or Opera.\n\nIf you're new to Firefox entirely, you'll appreciate the other features, including the RSS feeds, the JavaScript debugger, the basic download manager, and the ability to search several popular sites (such as Google) directly from the address bar. You can easily create toolbars by dragging and dropping icons. More technically minded users will appreciate that Firefox displays the page source in a new window, using indents and color-coded tags like an HTML editor. The built-in pop-up blocker is still extremely effective, and Firefox's reuptation for tight security is still well deserved. Anyone who's tired of IE will find more than one reason to like this free alternative.\n\nTop Ten Reason To Switch To Firefox:\n1. Tabbed Browsing - Makes surfing the web faster\n2. Popup Blocking\n3. Find Stuff Easier\n4. Simplified Privacy / Annoyance Eliminator\n5. Better Bookmarks and History\n6. Accessible, Intelligent, Responsive\n7. Customizable and Extendable\n8.

"2","How was it possible for scientists to determine that helium was present in the sun?","In the late 19th century, helium, which was not known on earth, was discovered using spectroscopy.  This was done by examining the spectrum of the sun.  How was it possible for scientists to determine that helium was present in the sun when there are other gases also present with their own spectra?","Each gas has a unique set of spectral lines that serves as a spectroscopic fingerprint.  These lines, incidentally, are created through transitions of electrons from high energy states to low energy states; each transition has a unique amount of energy associated with it which translates to a photon of a particular wavelength.  Helium was discovered by subtracting out all the spectral absorption lines associated with known elements from the solar emmision spectrum, similar to the way an audio technician can enhance a vocal track by subtracting instrumental tracks one at a time.

"2","why is the sky blue?","","The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. \n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white."

Just get out and do something...anything to avoid sitting at home and thinking about the person.  Have a good cry, listen to sad love songs and then get out of the house and do some things.  Try spending extra time with friends or your kids(if you have them), or even at work.  You will find as each day goes by the pain fades.  You may still love the person, but when you think of them again it won't hurt anymore as time goes by."

It was founded by black nationalist Dr. Ron ""Maulana"" Karenga, and first celebrated from December 26, 1966, to January 1, 1967. Karenga calls Kwanzaa the African American branch of ""first fruits"" celebrations of classical African cultures."
"7","what does yahoo mean?","","The word ""Yahoo"" was originated in English by Jonathan Swift in his tremendously influential novel of 1726, ""Gulliver's Travels."" In Gulliver's fourth journey, he visited a land populated by an intelligent race of horses called the Houyhnhnm, who are completely controlled by reason and rational thought. They dominate the a race of hideous beasts known as Yahoos, who are human beings in the same form as Gulliver. Gulliver soon befriends the Houyhnhnm despite his own Yahoo-like appearance and soon loathes the race of Yahoos. When he returns home at the end of his voyage, since the Houyhnhnms no longer are able to keep this Yahoo-like creature around, the novel ends darkly with Gulliver despising all human interaction and longing for the horse race. ""Yahoo"" is a term for a human being who is crude and boorish in all his desires.\n\nThe founders of Yahoo! have stated that the term they selected is an acronym for ""Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Object,"" since their fledgling Yahoo! project was just another one of those internet sites assimilating information into digital form."
"3","what kind of cough syrup is best for the cough caused by Pneumonia?","","When I had pneumonia NO cough syrup worked.

"4","is sympathy identical to pity or is pity not, in fact, a stronger word?","","I don't think one term is necessarily stronger than the other but sympathy implies a fellow-feeling, a sharing of sorry where pity implies looking down on the person or situation.  You might have sympathy for someone who is ill but pity someone who is in jail because of a crime they committed."
"2","is possible to travel through time??","","The answer is simple: we travel through time constantly.  Is it possible to travel backwards?  Science does not currently know the answer. Travelling backwards would entail travel at speeds greater than c (the speed of light).  But it is a fact that to move any body from rest to that speed requires an infinite amount of energy, which does not exist.  So, the only option is to use a particle which ALWAYS travels faster than c.  This particle is called a tachyon, as predicted by M-Theory, but whether or not such a particle exists is currently speculative.  The tachyon has a negative mass, travels at velocities greater than c, and travels in the opposite direction of time as we do."
"2","Re: A Classical Objection to Modern Physics?","How is it that a bird can dive from a branch straight down below him for a worm and not be influenced by the fact that the Earth is simultaneously rotating/ revolving?","The same reason nothing you ever observe is affected by the earth revolving.  It's moving at a constant velocity, meaning there is no acceleration and therefore no force (F=ma).  Force is what you feel, which is why you feel pushed toward the back seat of a car when you are accelerating (speeding up) but you don't feel it when you're moving constantly.  Like, in a vehicle, if you throw up a ball, it will come right straight down because if the car is moving at 50 mph, it, you, and the car are all moving at 50 mph.  The bird, us, the air, the tree, the worm.. everything's moving at the velocity of the earth so it is considered ""at rest"" because it is our frame of reference."

"4","who is assaf rosenblatt?","Is his ""answers engine"" in brainboost really a breakthru or is it just a new gimmick?","How is Brainboost different from existing engines like Google?\n\nBrainboost is an answer engine whereas Google is a Search engine.\n\nWhat that means is that Brainboost actually finds answers to your questions posed in plain English as opposed to directing you to pages that simply mention the questions.\n\nBrainboost, Using the AnswerRank™ system, intelligently reads hundreds of web pages derived from search results and extracts just the short and concise answer to your question, saving you time.\n\nFollowing is a simplistic explanation showing the process of both engines\n\n    Google\n\n    * User types in : “Why is mars red”\n    * Google Search engine retrieves all pages containing words ""mars"" and red"".\n    * Search results are sorted by the number of links each one of them got from other pages. This is a good way to figure out which one of them is most trusted by others.\n    * Results are displayed with the snippet being the appearance of the question on the pages\n    * Typically, a user would then click on the first search result, read through the document and hope to find an answer.\n    * If an answer is not found within the first search result, the user needs to repeat this process with the next search result, sometimes having to read many web pages to finally get at the answer.\n\n\n    Brainboost\n\n    * User types in : “Why is mars red”\n    * Brainboost translates the query into multiple queries that will raise the probability of finding the ANSWER to the question.\n    * Brainboost retrieves search engine results.\n    * Brainboost retrieves top several hundred pages and reads them.\n    * Brainboost finds answers and ranks them based on it's proprietary AnswerRank™ technology. AnswerRank™ knows to look at a set of many possible answers and rank them as to which one is probably the most correct. In this case: ""Mars is red because of the iron in the soil""\n    * Brainboost displays the ANSWERS to the user\n\nSo you see, Brainboost is a fundamentally different way to find knowledge. Whereas Search engines force you to spend time searching for that piece of information, Brainboost does that for you by automatically reading the search results and extracting the precious answer to your question.\n\nWhen you add up all time we spend plowing through search results for an answer, this functionality translates to hours of time saved.\n\nWhile search engines like MSN and Ask Jeeves have recently made limited attempts at answering questions from finite databases or precanned editorially collected answers, Brainboost is the only engine that leverages the full knowledge available on the web.\n\nBrainboost. It’s the next evolutionary step in search engines."

"5","Difference between pass by reference and pass by value?","","You should specify more the programming language context.\n\nIn general, passing by value means the subprogramme that receives the value gets a copy and cannot, thus, modify the original variable used by the caller. It's often said that the function may not produce side-effects.\n\nPassing by reference allows for side effects.\n\nBut many languages make this a little more complicated. You may pass a ""reference"" or a ""pointer"" by value, which means that the original pointer will still point to the same object/memory area when the subprogramme returns. But if the pointer is not marked constant, then the contents pointed to may suffer changes."

Once they see that you have tried to resolve the issue, they will get involved and will most likely credit your card right away.  \n\nGood luck!"

"1","How is ASLAN like JESUS in the Chronicles of Narnia?","","Even though C.S. Lewis insisted that the Chronicles of Narnia were not allegorical with reference to the Bible, there are several clear parallels that can be drawn:\n-Aslan is a lion king who has temporarily lost power to the white witch, and Jesus is referred to as the Lion of Judah. In the Christian faith, He is also the rightful King, though Satan controls earth for now.\n-Aslan offers himself willingly as a sacrifice in the place of Edmund, who is supposed to die according to the deep magic. Jesus offers Himself as a substitute for mankind when He dies on the Cross.\n-Like Aslan, Jesus is amazingly resurrected even though He was slain by His enemy.\n-Aslan breathes life into those creatures that were frozen by the white witch, and they live again. Because of Jesus Christ, the dead will rise again at the Resurrection."

"7","what is spot advertising?","","Spot Advertising\nTelevision is without question a highly effective communications medium and through its dual audio/visual strengths helps stimulate sales more effectively than any other medium. Over 97% of UK households have a television, well over half own two sets and nearly 54% of the country's households currently have multichannel TV. \n\nEven with the development of techniques such as sponsorship, ad funded programming and advertorials, spot advertising still takes the lion's share of TV advertising revenue. Significant investment in creative work for TV commercials is due to research which shows that television offers the ultimate combination of sound, vision and movement to create the next best thing to having a salesman in the living room. Many brands have utilised the medium to great effect to create advertising which resonates with the public psyche, good examples are Levi's (Launderette), Guinness (Horses) and Hamlet (The mild cigar)."
"7","Why do stars twinkle?","","Stars twinkle because of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. You can think as the atmosphere being made up of several ""layers."" Each layer has a different temperature and density. As the light from a star passes through the atmosphere, it is bent by each layer, and we perceive the twinkling. \n\nThe bending of the light when it passes from one medium to another, like water to air, or one layer of air to another, is called refraction. Refraction is what makes a straw look bent when you put it in a glass of water. Refraction also makes the stars and the Sun near the horizon look higher in the sky than they really are. In fact, when the Sun is setting, we are seeing the sun's disk when the Sun is already below the horizon!\n\nhttp://www.mira.org/fts0/stars/text/txt001c.htm"

"2","why the moon show the same face?","","The answer is that the Moon's period of revolution (one orbit around the Earth) is the same as the Moon's period or rotation (one spin around it's axis). The result is that the Moon always keeps on side facing the Earth.\n\nThis phenomena is called ""tidal locking"" and occurs because, while the Moon generates tides in the Earth, the Earth also generates a tide in the Moon (in the solid rock). The Moon's tidal budge moves as the Moon rotates. The energy for this, and the gravitational effects from the distortion, lead to a braking effect. The Moon slows down its rotation until it is such that the buldge is on one side always faces the Earth.  Now the tidal bulge is stationary (facing the Earth) and no more braking occurs. \n\nThis is also related to why there are lot more Lunar Mare on the near side than the far side. The Moon's core is shifted slightly towards the Earth, so it was easier for lava seas to form on the near side.\n\nMany other satellites are tidally locked to their planet. Mercury is almost tidally locked to the Sun."

Going in to work each day for the prestige and the money but hating himself for doing it? He'd rather be out shoveling the stuff that other people are picking up. Promising himself that he'll do it when he retires but fearing that he won't live that long.\n\nThere are high prestige jobs and low prestige jobs, high pay and low pay, servile jobs and jobs that don't feel important.

Your children can sense that you are unhappy, even if you think you dont show it. Whats more is, if you have a son, he may get the impression that men dont touch their wives and grow up thinking thats how it is, and then in turn do that to his women. If you have a daughter, she may get the idea that she shouldnt need or want affection and marry someone as such and feel just as you are 20 years from now.\nI suggest talking to him. Telling him you do need affection. If he still wont budge, there is always counceling....but you must let him know you would leave him if thngs dont change. He may actually want out himself."

Why arming Saddam in the 80s like US did. They knew he was a crook but that didnt matter for Reagan or Bush sr. Who cared about the Iraqi peolpe back then supporting there oppressor. \n\nIn a way by being in Iraq at the moment and hopefully building something that will last will bring some ease on US as a nation that before supported the Iraqi peoples opressor. Like clean up there own mess in a way. \n\nBefore people begin jump me and call me anti american I will point out that US wasnt the only nation that supported Saddam in the 80s.

The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word ""black"". The term ""black hole"" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return."
"5","Is there a Firefox extension that will notify you to when a website has updated?","It's easy for websites with an RSS feed, but what about for others?","I do not know of any that would notify you when a website changes. I think the reason for that is with so many websites that have dynamic data, it would become monotonous when you are notified everytime a date changes, or some subtle part of a website changes. \n\nWebsites owners and website visitors are more apt to utilize syndication feeds on thier sites, you might have heard of RSS, or ATOM links. These are ways for a website to publish when new pertinent information is published. Firefox has built in support for RSS/ATOM feeds with the ""Live Bookmark"" feature.

"5","how to choice lcd or monitar tv for computers?","","Basically if you are going to do any gaming or applications that require a fast response time you will want something that has a response time of less than or around 16ms and if it isn't you may experience a ghosting effect which causes blurry images on fast moving sequences.  But I'll tell you this is subjective.  My 17"" Samsung monitor has a refresh rate of 35ms and I have never noticed any ghosting with games such as Half Life 2 or Doom 3.

You can use your straight edge to draw the edges of the square.\n\nReason this works:\n\nIn steps 4 through 6, you contructed the perpendicular bisector to the diameter of the original circle.\n \nThis means that segment DE is a diameter of the orignal circle (since it passes through the center of the circle). This also means segment BC and DE form a right angle. \n\nIf you look at triangles BAD and DAC; BA, AD, AC are all radii of the original circle (and thus the same length). Therefore the triangles are exact copies of each other and BD and DC are the same legth. This logic will show you that all the sides are the same length.\n\nAngle DBE inscribes one half of the original circle since DE is the diameter of the circle. This makes DBE a right angle. Similar logic will show you all angles of your square are right angles. \n\nSince your sqare has all equal sides and all equal angles, it is a square."

The good thing about GPS vs a footpod, is that you don't have to calibrate it.  However, if there are a lot of trees or other interference, the GPS signal doesn't come thru all the time.  The 205 and 305 are supposed to have stronger reception."

I'm scared that colleges will either, see this fact and turn me down because of it, or not see it at all and only look at my GPA which has been falling because of the class, therefore making me inadequate for accpetance in some colleges.","It depends.  Colleges will not just look at your grades and GPA.  There are other factors that they include.  If you go to their website, they should have a brief outline of what they are going to look at (i.e. SAT scores, involvement in & out of school, etc..) Most likely, I believe, it's the essay that counts; it can either make or break you.  Plus, you have to consider that there are a lot of people you are competiting with.  If you haven't sent in the application yet, try and talk to your teacher and both of you guys may come up with a solution about how to improve your grades."

To file for a trademark logo, direct your browser to this page: http://www.uspto.gov/teas/index.html and click on ""Apply for a new Mark"". then click on \n""Trademark/Servicemark Application, Principal Register""\nThe filing fee for the TEAS form is $325 per class of goods and/or services, so essentially $325. \nOnce you have completed this application, keep the contact phone #'s and email addresses to reach the departments that will be reviewing your application. The process can easily take up to 6 months, but the good news is that once you are in the system this will supercede anyone else from filing for a similar trademark. Just stay on them. Call/email at least monthly. As long as no one else previously has applied for this trademark or currently owns the trademark, go ahead and begin drawing up signage/letterhead/t-shirts,etc. Don't wait 6 months, for the official approval."
"3","What is Stem Cell? In which year treatments will be offered to the mankind with the help of Stem Cells?","","Stem cells give rise to normal blood components including red cells, white cells and platelets. Stem cells are normally located in the bone marrow and in the blood and can be harvested for a transplant. \n\nStem cell transplants are occuring right now. It all depends on the nature of the disease or treatment as to whether they can be used.

Because the change in momentum is equal to the impulse, you can usually set mv=Ft.  You should be given the mass and velocity, and either force or the change in time(duration) in order to solve for the other one.  If the question is asking for both, then you probably have to find force first in some other way, then use that formula.  If you need to find the force in some other way, just think about all of Newton's laws and stuff that you've learned and use them with the rest of the information that the problem gives you, and you should be able to come up with something... if not, post the whole question here and ill try to help :)"

"8","Why did the WWF change its name to WWE?","","Following a 2000 lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund (also WWF), the Federation changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE. Its parent company, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, also chose to adopt this name. The lawsuit dealt with the wrestling company's breaching of an agreement with the Fund over use of the initials ""WWF"" in the United Kingdom. Rather than attempt a financial settlement with the Fund, McMahon changed the name of the company. The logo was altered, and a promotional campaign called ""Get The F Out"" was used to publicize this change. Also, all verbal and visual references to ""WWF"" and the World Wrestling Federation logo from the ""Attitude"" era were edited out from old broadcasts. Some observers saw the new name as further acknowledgement by the company on its emphasis towards the entertainment rather than athletic aspects of professional wrestling."

"5","Network Attached Server (NAS Server)?","Hi, I would like to buy a NAS Server for home use. The options are from Buffallo Tech, Western Digital and Tritton Tech.

Thanks","Actually NAS is better known as Network Attached Storage. I currently use a 160GB Buffalo LinkStation and found it extremely easy to configure and use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe LinkStation is a network-attached storage device, but it also includes a print server, attachable via one of its two USB ports, and it creates a shared folder for use by anyone on your network. You can use the other USB port to attach an additional drive, but you have to format it with the LinkStation first.\n\nDisk performance is limited by the network. 100 megabits per second (which is only a quarter of the raw capability of USB 2.0) so almost all of the other devices that I looked at outperformed the LinkStation handily. But the convenience of having disk storage available to all of your PCs makes the slower speed bearable. Buffalo does not currently provide centralized backup software for the LinkStation, but I had no problem scheduling and initiating backups from individual PCs using Windows Backup. The network connection was more than adequate for streaming music, even to multiple PCs.\n\nI referenced the following sites when I was trying to make my choice\n\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1874,677853,00.asp\nhttp://reviews-zdnet.com.com/Buffalo_LinkStation_120GB/4505-3382_16-30639593.html\nhttp://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-207-ProdID-HDHG250LAN.php"

Plug in the new harddrive, boot up the machine and it will pretty much do the work for you.

"3","how do i FAST properly?","","I fast and detox once a month and it's great for your mind as well as your body.  If you don't work on a Sunday I think it would be a good day to start.  I start the day with a long bath and throughout the day I try to keep active.  As I'm not a big eater it doesn't bother me if I don't eat food for a week.  For the rest of the week I drink water, fresh juice and herbal teas.  Water helps to break down body fat and get rid of access waste so by the end of the week I have lost about 1/2 stone and feel so much lighter.  If a week seems like a long time to go without anything to eat have raw vegetables.  This is what I have when coming of a detoxing fast.  I also find the hardest thing to eat and drink after is dairy produces.  They seem to have a heavier taste when you haven't had them for a while.  Not only will you loose both weight and toxins from your body you will also feel more happier and alert. \n\nDepending on your age, weight and lifestyle if you have any concerns maybe a visit to your doctor would be advisable if you had any real concerns."

Try reducing your swap file size.\n\nAlso, depending upon the sizes of your files, they may be taking up more disk space than the actual totals of the files.  In short, the file system can only write in fixed-length blocks (I think NTFS default is 64K).  If a file does not occupy the entire block, the rest is not used...the next file must be written to another block.  If you have tons of small files on your hard drive you may be using much more than the total sizes of the files.  There's not much way around this other than moving the files to another partition with smaller block sizes.\n\nFinally, some applications (like Photoshop) actually reserve block of space on the hard drive as ""private"" swap space.  This guarantees the application will always have a work area on the disk while its operating.  Check with the software vendor for some of your applicationsto see if this is the case and if you can either resize the reserved block, or move it to another drive."
"7","how do i start a business?","","It all depends on the type of business you are going to start. \n\nWell first of all to start any business you need a fair amount of capital. Either you put in your own capital or take out a bank loan. Next, You should hire people to work for You (Again this depends on the type of business your going to start). Another important thing is the place where your gonna start your business.

Please give all of the details that you know about this team.?","","NBL Years:\n \n1946/47: Owned by Italian Immigrant Danny Biasone the Syracuse Nationals begin play in the National Basketball League, in the same year professional basketball was finally gaining some legitimacy with the rival Basketball Association of America that was based in large cities like New York and Philadelphia. While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns the Nationals put together a 21-23 record finishing in 4th place. In the playoffs the Nats, would be beaten by the fellow upstate neighbor Rochester Royals in 4 years.\n\n1947/48: In their second season the Nationals would struggle finishing in 5th place with a 24-36 record. Despite their struggles the Nats would make the playoffs getting swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in 3 straight games.\n\n1948/49: Several teams begin to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger is laid. Staying in the NBL the Nationals sign AL Cervi to be player coach as Dolph Schayes makes his professional debut leading the Nats to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40-23. In the playoffs the Nationals would make quick work of the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers winning the series in 2 straight games. However, in the semifinals the Nats would fall to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in 4 games. Following the season the remaining NBL teams would join the BAA as the two leagues merged and became the NBA.\n\nNBA Years:\n \n1949/50: The Nationals were an instant success in the NBA winning the Eastern Division with a league best record of 51-13. In the playoffs the Nationals would continue to play solid basketball beating the Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight. Moving on to the Eastern Finals the Nationals would battle the New York Knickerbockers beating their big city rivals in a 3-game series. Moving on to the NBA Finals the Nationals would face fellow NBL alum Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nats would lose just their 2nd home game of the season 68-66. The Nats would not recover as they fell behind 3 games to 1 before falling in 6 games. \n\n1950/51: Despite several teams leaving the NBA to reorganize the NBL the Nationals deiced to stay put. In their second NBA season the Nationals would play mediocre basketball all season finishing in 4th place with a record of 32-34. However, in the playoffs the Nats would play their best basketball of the season as they stunned the 1st place Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91-89. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nationals would be beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard fought 5-game series losing the finale by just 2 points.         \n\n1951/52: Al Cervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game, as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40-26 record. In the playoffs the Nats would knock the Philadelphia Warriors off again in a 3-game series. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats would fall to the New York Knickerbockers again dropping the series in 4 games.\n\n1952/53: The Nationals would finish in 2nd place in a hard fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division with a record of 47-24. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87-81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals would take the Celtics deep in to overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111-105, in what remains the longest game in NBA history.\n\n1953/54: The Nationals acquire Alex Groza and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams. Once again the Nationals would battle for the Division title falling 2 games short with a 42-30 record. In the playoffs the Nats would win all 4 games of a round robin tournament involving the 3 playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals the Nats would stay hot beating"
"3","can hernias cause bowel problems?","","Hernias are outpouching of the intestinal wall through the muscular layer of the abdomen.  Hernias can occur in many areas of the abdomen, and can be harmless or very serious.  When hernias become strangulated (trapped bewteen the muscular wall and blood supply is cut off) then the bowel can lose its blood supply and die... this condition requires immediate surgery.  Minor hernias are usually more of a cosmetic thing and do not cause much serious problems (unless they strangulate) but if you ever have to have surgery on your stomach (gall bladder, appendix, etc) then you should have it fixed at the same time."

The Taipan or Brown snakes and the Funnel Web Spider top out the lists generally.\n\nThe most forceful bite, although non venomous is the aligator snapping turtle.

"1","What came first, the chicken or the egg?","or even greater, why did the chicken cross the road","This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?"

"5","What are the benefits of switching from win 2000 pro to XP?","I want to use my PC more for multimedia.","Hello, \n\nHere are some strong reason's you should consider upgrading to XP. \n\nStability. Windows XP has the ability to run a large number of apps without running out of resources, without crashing. (If you're running Windows 2000, you already have this, so there's no gain. \nSecurity. This is a huge topic that I can't adequately cover in a few sentences suffice to say that security of your data and your privacy in Windows XP is leaps and bounds beyond anything available in Windows 9x. (Again, if you have Windows 2000, you already have most of the security capabilities of Windows XP.) \nUI enhancements. A variety of changes in Start menu, taskbar, Windows Explorer, and Control Panel make everyday tasks such as launching programs, switching between windows, and managing files just a little bit faster, easier, and more convenient. These features can each be customized, so you can use the ones you like and change others back to Windows 9x/2000 style. (Similarly, you can banish the new look of Windows XP while still enjoying its other benefits.) \nFast User Switching. Great for shared computers, FUS lets someone else log on without requiring you to first close all your documents and applications. \nPower management. Standby and hibernation let me save power (on desktop PCs as well as portables) yet still have fast boot time, bringing me right back to where I left off. (That is, all the windows that I left open when the system powers down are already open when I power up.) \nDigital photo support. I was never a fan of digital photography until I got XP because it was such a hassle before. But the support for cameras and scanners, as well as the features built in to Windows Explorer for viewing, printing, e-mailing, and manipulating images have actually made it fun and practical to work with photos in new ways. \nRemote Assistance. The ability to actually see and work with someone else's screen while conversing with them through text, voice, and video chat is a killer feature for anyone who's looked upon as a computer guru and gets calls for support from relatives, friends, and neighbors. (I suspect that includes most PIBMUG members!) \nRemote Desktop. The ability to connect with my home computer from the office (or vice versa) is awesome. It looks and acts exactly as if I'm at that computer five miles away, and I have access to all its files, printers, and other resources. And like remote assistance, it's acceptably fast if you have broadband Internet access. I also use it to work with other computers on my own LAN that's sometimes easier than hopping back and forth between two computers. \nBetter help. It's easier to navigate, integrates information from the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and includes links to a number of diagnostic tools. \n\nPlease see here for more http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=why+upgrade+from+windows+2000+to+XP&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt \n\nhttp://www.windowsusers.org/whyupgrade.html"

"1","Which nation is world best in culture?","","That is a very difficult question.... Besides personal factors (""beauty in the eye of the beholder""), if one were to use some religious or spiritual criteria in this forum, there probably could be a basis for a consensus.

The Roman Empire is amazing history, Great Britain had a world empire, the USA has had a been a virtuous experiment... but it appears that the glory days, culturally, for USA is in the past. Whatever moral values one has (religious or secular), the direction of the government & entertainment (to name to major factors) has been going downhill since WWII. As have the developed countries, in general.\n\nI have wondered if I will want to stay in the US after I retire. It is becoming more & more difficult to maintain a Christian lifestyle - for even a nominal Christian - with all the worldly assaults & temptations, everywhere, all the time.\n\nSo the question becomes, for me, where do the people live in harmony with Christian values? (And, secondarily, have a healthy & pleasant environs.) I think I'll check Iceland... there is no heaven on earth - that's what I want."

I was attempting to save some MP3's on it (practice..trial/error) to bring it home to my wife for a gift. I couldn't delete all the files (clean) and decided to format. I formatted it just like anything else and then it wouldn't let me add new files...I then read the very broken english ""directions"" and it said only use FAT...well....I had used FAT32...so I reformatted with FAT....resulting in a new max storage capasity of 115mb.

"2","How is crude oil formed?","","Crude oil is formed from accumulations of small organisms, mostly phytoplankton and zooplanton that are buried in sediments in both marine and lacustrine (fresh water) environments. Other organic material is mixed in such as spores, pollen, woody material, and other material such as fecal pellets from marine organisms. These materials often settle through the water into an organic-rich mud that is very low in oxygen (anaerobic) so there are few organisms to feed on the material  and it accumulates over long periods of time. Rivers contribute to this process by both delivering large quantities of organic matter, and also large amounts of sediment to bury this organic matter. \n\nOver time these clay-rich sediments are buried under thousands of feet of sediments, dewatered by pressure from the overlying sediment and become shale. As the shale is buried its temperature increases due to geothermal warming. When it reaches temperatures and pressures of 140 degrees F. (60 C) it begins to convert to oil. As temperature increases from continuing burial processes it reachs a temperature where it begins to form natural gas. Both the oil and the gas are gradually expelled from the shale. Typically shales are found in depostional settings where they may be interbedded with sandstones. Sandstones will have higher porosity (more and bigger holes) than shale and the oil and gas will displace salt water that is remaining in the sandstones. Eventually the oil and gas migrates upward through the water and if the overlying structure has formed some sort of a trapping configuration, (like a sandstone overlain by an impervious shale, or a fault that has created a seal against the sandstone, then this becomes an oil reservoir. \n\nA very similar process occurs in carbonate rocks, like limestone and dolomite, except the organic material originates within the carbonate rock in many instances. If the carbonate reef (for example) has been buried by an impervious layer of shale or carbonate mud of a sabkha, it  will become an oil reservoir.  In other instances, the source of the oil will be a shale that is below the carbonate rocks, and the oil will migrate upward into this reservoir."

"3","Any successful ways to quit smoking?","","Below is what I wrote to a similar question. My response was chosen as the best answer.\n\nQuitting smoking is not an easy thing to do, especially alone. The longer you've smoked, the harder it is going to be to kick the habit.\n\nQuitting is going to require the assistance / guidance of a support group. Friends, family, and colleagues are going to have to support you during this time.\n\nTrying to quit cold turkey usually doesn't work. Using tools such as Nicotene Gum or a patch will help to reduce cravings. Eating carrot or celery sticks will help with the or-al fixation associated with smoking.\n\nGetting help from your doctor is probably a good way to go as well. \n\nThe American Cancer Society provides some good information as does the Wikipedia. Tobacco Free California is also a good resource to get help.\n\nBottomline, start with a plan. Involve your friends and family, and decide what is going to work best for you.\n\nGood luck!"

"7","is marijuna legal in amsterdam?","","Having traveled to Amsterdam about four times I can tell you the scoop.  Marijuana is legal however most people there try not to glamorize it so dont attempt to just pull a joint and smoke up in some of the bars and restaurants around Dam Square.  However they have cafe's  or they are called ""coffee shops""  Go in there, you can order green tea (most have no alcohol) and then ask for the weed menu.  On this menu it gives you the rundown on all the varieties they sell at the bar.  Some bars even have a small sample attached so you can smell it.  When you decide what you want just order it.  You can walk the streets while smoking a joint, just dont go puffing into businesses like grocery stores to the front desk of the hotel.  Imagine you live in a society where nobody can smoke indoors (imagine you live in California) just dont smoke inside.  However I smoked a lot in the hotel.  \n\nMushrooms... sorry they closed the shops just this year.  You cant get dry mushrooms anymore, however ask about wet mushrooms, but I believe they went away too.  \n\nCrack, coke, lsd, the worx.  You can get them in dam square just hang around the statues at night, you will see dirty looking people, they can get you pretty much everything.  Just dont eat the stuff out of thier bottle.  I think its dirty dirty meth...  I just guessed, but im not into the hard hard stuff.  just and FYI..."

"2","An entomologist noted that in the past 5 years in the local forest preserve, the population of bees decreased?","by 35%. In her study, she recorded that the # of active hives 5 years ago was 35. If the # of active hives decreased at the same rate as the bee population, how many hives are there today?","35% of 35 active hives is 35 x 0.35 = 12.25 hives. So if the number of active hives have decreased by 12.25 hives, then the remaining number of active hives is 35 - 12.25 = 22.75 hives. \n\nIt may not be possible to have a partial number of hives, in which case we might say that most likely 23 hives remain (this corresponds to a 34.3% drop in bee population as opposed to 37.1% drop had the number of hives fallen to 22)."
"7","how does sex feel?","","Well, different for girls & guys. It is a hard one to answer not knowing your gender. Still, I'll give it a shot as I've asked my husband questions before to find out what it feels like to him.\n\nFor the girl, it can be painful the first time or two, depending upon the size of the male as well as the internal size of the female. The good part for the female is that, believe it or not, you ""adjust"" somewhat in size to be able to handle it.\n\nFor the guy, it can be rather stressful because he feels like he can ""go off"" at any second &, of course, if he does, it sort of shortens the enjoyment for both parties involved. From what I've been told, there is a sort of pressure that is felt as things build up. Any guy out there who would like to clarify more is welcome to do so :)\n\nFor both parties involved - especially if both are virgins - there will be a lot of times where things feel ticklish or just plain odd...like it feels good but there's just something different about it. Just roll with it & let yourself ""feel"" the feelings that happen because this is one of the best parts. For a woman who might not actually climax during the act, this might be THE best part so, if you are a guy, keep that in mind. If she's enjoying what you are doing, spend a few more minutes there before moving on. Anyway, overall, it quite honestly feels strange & wonderful all at the same time.\n\nNow, I will say this just to be full in my answer. There are times that it take forever for either to reach a climax & sometimes one or the other doesn't. These are the times where you must remember that practice makes perfect.\n\nAnd, again, be careful & protect yourself, please. That in mind, have fun..."

"2","Why is the sweet flavor so good?","Why do humans (and other animals) perceive the sweet flavor as pleasant?","Sweet tastes good because sweetness in fruit is an indicator of ripeness, and ripe fruit is the most nutritious.  So, once upon a time, a sweet tooth was an evolutionary advantage -- those who enjoyed sweetness sought out the most ripe fruit and had the healthiest diets.  With healthier diets, they survived the longest and passed their genes on to the most offspring. \n\nIronic.  Our appreciation for sugar is actually rooted in good nutrition.\n\nToday, we have extracted sugar from fruit, and for a human being it is no longer conducive to a healthy diet.  In fact, our craving for sugar now has the opposite effect."

"10","Who is the next Super Power ?","China - World's fastest growing economy, Huge Exports\nIndia - World's second fastest growing economy, huge FDI (Foreign Investment), leader in Information Technology\nRussia - Had the highest profit in trade last year, Biggest Petroleum Reserves.\n\nOr any other nation\nPlease provide a logical reasoning if you choose a different country that's not listed here","To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a ""developing"" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector."

"7","Is Variable Life Insurance a good investment vechicle?","I've heard good and bad about VUL. Given that a person has a stable job with benefits, would a mix of mutual funds and VUL be good investment choices?","VUL is not worth it.  Life insurance is not meant to be an investment tool.  Though, often cash value is the enticing aspect in the eyes of the consumer, insurance should be bought for protection.  VUL is often outperformed by Universal Life and basic Whole Life because of the higher administration costs, lack of investment options, and bad market performance.\n\nThe admin costs for VUL are more costly because every time someone touches a piece of paper in the insurance business there's a charge associated with it (ie, paying quarterly is more costly than paying annually because of the admin costs of receiving 3 more payments).  With VUL there is much more paper being processed, and more parties involved.\n\nYou have more options for investment within IRA's, or general investment accounts, so why not purchase insurance for insurance and investments for investments.  Too often, VUL policies lapse due to underfunding caused by bad performance or an agent's inflated illustration (ie, 10-14% returns), thus leaving the individual without coverage and needing to repurchase insurance at a higher rate due to their increased age.\n\nIsn't the purpose of buying insurance to eliminate risk?  VUL just adds a new form of risk into the equation.  If the lower price is the incentive, go with UL.  If you can afford it, go with Whole life.  It is the grandfather of the life insurance business and more money comes out of pocket, but the stability, guaranteed return and peace of mind is worth it."

"2","how much dose it cost to run a pc for 24 7?","","It probably costs about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to run a PC 24/7, depending where you live.  Most electronic gear is labeled with the power requirements in watts.  Just multiply that by 24 to get the watts per day and divide by 1,000 to get kilowatts.  For example, a 100 watt load times one hour equals 100 watt-hours and multiplied by 24 hours equals 2,400 watt-hours per day.  Dividing 2,400 watt-hours by 1,000 equals 2.4 KW-hours (kilowatt-hours) per day.  This would cost 2.4 time 10 cents or about 24 cents.  Of course, the PC and the monitor each need to be calculated separately.  Also, if the PC is not in constant use it may go into ""sleep mode"" reducing the power drain.  I read that some people never shut off their PC's because re-starting them may subject the chips to frequent power surges reducing chip life.  In the winter, I consider that the power consumed by my PC helps heat the house.  What is the difference between a 1,000 watt electrical load such as the cooking range vs a 1,000 watt electric heater?  Only the location.  Good luck."

It means a god who predicts the future, like Apollo. It also means the priest who hears the message, and the message itself, and the place where the priest hears the message. Most often it means the priest or the message. \nThe Greeks believed (like all other ancient people) that you could communicate with the gods at certain places, at certain times, through certain people, and that the gods would give you advice and maybe tell you what was going to happen in the future. \n\nBut the Greek oracles had a couple of advantages too. First, you didn't just come and ask your question. You had to hang around the temple for a while, talking to the priests, so they could get to know you. And they could see you, not just hear your voice on the telephone. Second, everybody came to the same few oracles for help, and the priests at these oracles (unlike the Psychic Hotline) compared notes with each other. So if you asked ""Should I get married?"" and the oracle said ""Yes,"" and then next week your girlfriend comes and she asks, ""Will Gorgias ask me to marry him?"" then the oracle already knows the answer to that one. There is every reason to think that the oracles were worth the money they charged. \n\nhttp://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/LAO.html\nhttp://www.paralumun.com/greekfuture.htm"

"1","who wrote the book of revelation and in what year?","","The question can best be answered by stating that John penned the book of Revelation, while our Lord Jesus is the Author.  The correct title of the book comes at the very beginning, ""The Revelation of Jesus Christ.""  John was shown what to write.  He received Revelation while imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos.\n\nThe strongest evidence for dating any ancient historical document is internal.  The second evidence is written tradition, a way of refering to non-scripture.  We know that unlike other apostles, John did not die a martyrs death.\n\nThe first history of the church, outside of the first century book of Acts (by Luke who also wrote Luke), was that of Eusebius in the 4th century.  Eusebius relates the story of John being carried to church in his old age, telling fellow Christians to love one another, for in that all was fulfilled.\n\nDates given for the writing vary, but scholars set a late date of being during the Roman Emperor Domitian's reign.  This is said to be about AD 95-96.  This is highly significant as it would be the very last ""theopneustos"" (God breathed) scripture written.\n\nIt is also significant, because the REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST serves as the expounder and capstone of the prophetic writings.  It could be said that the most vital book to understanding Revelation is the book of Daniel, because this book is the only one which not only gives the events, but also the times (this is noted by Josephus in his description of Daniel).\n\nSince the author, our Lord Jesus, is eternal (Rev. 21:6), it could be said that His Revelation not only was written, but that it is and always has been written, and the book carries a great curse for whoever adds to it -- REVELATION ADDS ALL THE PLAGUES OF THE BOOK!!!  To those who take away -- IT SAYS GOD SHALL TAKE AWAY HIS PART OF THE BOOK OF LIFE, AND OUT OF THE HOLY CITY, AND FROM THE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK.\n\nYears ago, an old mentor of mine showed me a greek version of Revelation he had.  It showed the variants (places where somehow different manuscripts disagree).  Nevertheless, certain variants do not cast doubt upon the reliability of transmission.\n\nMy study of Revelation has revealed that a concordance, careful study, and reverence for Almighty God reveal the same exact themes found in varying scriptures, both old and new, (also helpful are the book of Enoch and also Yashir ""Jasher"").  Someone who is truly up to such a task shall find that only the Omniscient Creator could tie such a sweeping exposition of scripture into a dispersed narrative of the end of the age and the renewal of all things under Messiah.\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ is the Author.  John wrote the book.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nTake care,\nMark"

"2","what is the measure of how much surface an object has?","","SURFACE AREA\n\n\nSurface area is the area of a given surface. Roughly speaking, it is the ""amount"" of a surface (i.e., it is proportional to the amount of paint needed to cover it), and has units of distance squared. Surface area is commonly denoted  for a surface in three dimensions, or  for a region of the plane (in which case it is simply called ""the"" area). \n\n\n\n\nSurface area refers to the summation of the areas of the exposed sides of an object.\n\nUnits\nUnits for measuring surface area include:\n\nsquare metre = SI derived unit \nare = 100 square metres \nhectare = 10,000 square metres \nsquare kilometre = 1,000,000 square metres \nsquare megametre = 1012 square metres \nImperial units, as currently defined from the metre:\n\nsquare foot (plural square feet) = 0.09290304 square metres. \nsquare yard = 9 square feet = 0.83612736 square metres \nsquare perch = 30.25 square yards = 25.2928526 square metres \nacre = 160 square perches or 43,560 square feet = 4046.8564224 square metres \nsquare mile = 640 acres = 2.5899881103 square kilometres \nThe article Orders of magnitude links to lists of objects of comparable surface area.\n\n\nUseful formulae\nArea of a rectangle (and, in particular, a square): length × width \nArea of a triangle: ½ × base × height \nArea of a disk: π × r² \nArea of a sphere: 4 × π × r² \nTotal surface area of a right circular cylinder: 2 × π × r × (h + r) \nLateral surface area of a right circular cylinder: 2 × π × r × h \nTotal surface area of a right circular cone: π × r × (l + r) \nLateral surface area of a right circular cone: π × r × l"
"2","Is there a connection between the phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanos?","","Yes, there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes.  Both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth.  The moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans, affecting weight of water over portions of the earth.  The moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway.  Of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun's light relative to the positions of the sun, moon and earth.  Because the ocean tides (and crustal tides) also depend on these same positions where the sun either works with or against the moon), the phase of the moon can slightly affect the weight of the straw that breaks the camel's back."
"5","Which free email service is the best?","i want to fix a permanent email id (which is available free)","Until the new Yahoo! mail comes out of beta -- or at least the beta goes public -- the easiest to use is Google mail.  It also gives you the most storage (more than 2.5 GB).\n\nThat said, the new Yahoo! mail is said to be more like Outlook than Google is, and the current Yahoo! mail is pretty good, so if you're used to Outlook you should probably consider getting a Yahoo! account and waiting for the new version.\n\nOf course, you can always sign up for both, and try them both out -- perhaps by signing each one up for a few mailing lists."

"7","What is the best strategy to pay off your debt?","","Two strategies:  1) cut your spending, and 2) reorganize your debt.\n\n1) Try to figure out the LEAST amount you can spend, and still live.  Eliminate all fees (ATM, long distance, late fees, etc).  Cancel any frills until you are debt free (got a land line AND a cell phone?  Cancel one.  Cancel cable - you'll be amazed at the deals they will offer you to come back!)  Eat in.  Don't spend a penny on Soda/candy from a machine or coffee from a trendy coffee-bar.\n\n2)  list your debt in order, highest interest rate to lowest.  Your strategy is to eliminate the highest ones, either by moving the debt down to lower rates, or by paying it off.  \n\nI disagree with the previous answer (not to pay off credit card debt with an equity line).  Of course, this should be done with care, but this is one of the best strategies - secured debt (like an equity line) is almost always cheaper interest rate than unsecured debt (like credit cards).  ""You could lose your house"", yes, if you are stupid or not careful.  But you can also eliminate debt much quicker!  \n\nShop every rate that you have.  If you have an Equity line at Prime + 2, Shop it.  You may be able to get a Home Equity line at Prime - .75 (I just did).\n\nI believe that it's to my advantage to have debt and savings.  Low interest, tax-saving debt can be a good thing (like my Home Equity Line).  High interest debt and fees are for somebody besides me."

Looks like my vitreous jelly is liquifying and allowing individual strands to lock. Can this happen? Is there some other explanation? Most important, is there anything I can do to deal with this?","It's important to get this checked out by an eye doctor. Sometimes people get floaters and it's not big deal, sometimes they go away, sometimes not, and it's not harmful. Other times, it can be a sign of something more serious. If you see any flashes of light, go immediately to a doctor (might even be cause to go to an emergency room) because that is a sign of a detaching retina (which can make you blind). In other cases, the floaters can be caused by something called neovascularization, which means new blood vessels forming in the eye. This really shouldn't happen, and can be corrected with lasers. I'm told it's not very uncomfortable. If you are diabetic,  this is a risk.\n\nSome causes of floaters that I am aware of: neovascularization causing distortions because the new blood vessels may cause a blind spot on the retina (laser treatment is a possibility); a small bleed in the vitreous that casts a shadow on the retina (may resolve in time, but needs to be checked still); the vitrous can pull away from the retina as a person ages, sometimes leaving a bit of debris, more common in people who are myopic (may resolve in time, not much to be done about it, but needs to be checked to make sure there isn't traction pulling on the retina, which can cause a detached retina).\n\nIn any case, just get it checked out right away. If there is a problem, it can probably be treated before it gets worse. Better sooner than later. Good luck."

You will be assimilated - resistance is futile.\n\nAnd for centuries, resistance was largely futile, until the renaissance period. \n\nYou should forgive most proselytisers. Most do not comprehend that their proselytising ways are often highly insulting and/or offensive to people of other religions and ways of life. They just can't see it.\n\nTo them, assimilating you into the collective is a good thing and they get the kudos of having 'saved you'.\n\nThe best way to respond is to ask them lots of questions about their faith's inconsistencies, most of which either hav no answers or have answers that involve an industrial-sized spinning machine. And always check out that their Bible quotes are correct as much gets mistranslated (from Greek/Hebrew into English) and/or taken out of its biblical context.

Maybe a cyst, also really common in people of all ages. It probably burns from all the friction of standing and sitting,just moving around. I wouldn't say it's an STD seeing as how this is on your backside and most STD's show up on the front."

"1","what is the main difference between British English and American English?","It's a little difficult for me to listen to British accent.  English is my second language.  We have not much chance to hear a Brisith accent.  What is the main difference between British English and American English?  Is that also difficult for Americans?  I am a Taiwanese.","American English suffers ""colonial lag"", meaning that the English that is spoken in America has roots in the 17th century and then diverged. British English evolved in ways that American English did not. \n\nThere's sentence structures Americans use that British do not. Like ""have gotten"", that ""en"" ending with ""have"" is an old form of English.\n\nYou'll see that in the French of Montreal, Quebeq, Canada too. \n\nI see it in my mother's Japanese, it's very pre WWII and she taught me ""old fashioned"" Japanese that make modern Japanese people laugh. ""You sound like my grandmother."" They would say. Hey! I was taught by a grandmother. \n\nIreland has colonial lag too. If you read Shakespear with an Irish accent the rhymes would work. \n\nIn England there's a class system. So one's station in life can be deduced by the accent one has. Changing one's class is more difficult because one's accent would show where someone came from. I think that's why there are so many different accents in England and smaller pockets of the population that speak them. There's history behind it. \n\nAmericans don't have a class system like that. There's a lot of movement up and down the social ladder caused by wealth or the loss of wealth. I think that national TV is blurring the lines of the accents in America. There are classes on how to loose a regional accent when going into business. What is the dominant accent... watch the TV News. The ""Walter Cronkite"" accent.  \n\nThe slang in England and America will be different and that's the most difficult thing for a non-native speaker to learn. You would not call a small pack worn with a belt around your waist a ""fanny pack"" in England. That's very naughty. It's not naughty in America. Americans don't call a cigarette a ""f a g"". That comes from ""faggot"" which lit the fuse on cannons. In America it means a homosexual. \n\nBritish speakers of English have difficult with the slang in Australia. Australians with Americans. We all share English but after the colonies were established the English evolved in different directions. \n\nThe main difference between British and American use of English will be seen with the vowels. I'd focus on that if I were you.  Speakers of British English don't open their mouths as wide as Americans. Reading their lips is a little more difficult.\n\nIf you have a DVD player, get a movie that is made in English, put on the English Captions, listen to the movie and look at how the words are spelled out. That's the cheapest way to learn a language. To witness it in action, in a situation, because language is more than the words, it's gestures, eye contact, how close you stand to someone when speaking.\n\nJust look at the French when they shrug their shoulders. Both shoulders are used, their hands go up, they pucker their lips, tilt their head. It's a full body ""I don't know"" motion. What you hear may be just a ""pffft"" sound. \n\nSo watching movies will help in the non-verbal communication. \n\nYou're going to be using a different side of your head reading English. Chinese characters come in the brain like art, sounds of birds, that sort of thing because they are pictures that have meaning. Alphabets that make words that are used in sentences use the other side of the brain, where math is processed. \n\nYou got your work cut out for you. Good luck."
"2","Why only ATP and GTP (in some cases) is energy giving molecule.?","why not other molocules are working as energy molocule","You know what you are asking here can't reallly be answered. The reason ATP is the main energy source is because that's what happened through the process of evolution. And, as you know, there is no way to determine WHY something happened when it comes to evolution -- despite what the intelligent design advocates will tell you. All you can say, based on the ubiquitious nature of ATP's usage as the main energy carrier throughout most living organisms, is that ATP became the preferred energy carrier very early on in evolutionary time. Probably going back as far as the last universal common ancestor (LUCA)."

If you happen to be in one of the areas they serve, you can contact them for a local listing.\n\nMy little friendly suggestion: a lot of people this time of year decide they want to volunteer NOW. Which is certainly a good and generous thought. But in many cases, organizations may have already filled their holiday needs, from their regular volunteer corps. So try not to feel grumpy or rejected if your idea of a perfect Christmas volunteer outing isn't available. Stick with it in January, February, etc. - there's plenty that needs to be done all year round! 8>)\n\nThanks!"

I don't want to seem insensitive. ;-)\n\nI would say: (1) a deep, rich wine or plum color or (2) moss green or (3) a beautiful earthenly champagne color. Have you ever seen the pictures of Cindy Crawford in a champagne-colored dress when she was a bridesmaid/attendant for one of her model friends? That is the color I am thinking of and it was stunning! I hope you know what I mean. It was in People Magazine a few years ago.\n\nLast year, I attended a late fall wedding in Sicily, Italy. The reception was held in a castle. The attendants had shimmery gold, rustic brown and forest green dresses. Each one was a different color and it was gorgous beyond gorgous. Coupled with the massive wrap-around outdoor terrace, the Greek-syle columns in this place, cashmere walls and paintings worth a small fortune, a luxury yacht moored in the Meditteranean with little blinking strings of light everywhere, right off the grounds....it was like a fairy-tale. I know this is a bit much that most people can afford but I have no idea of your income / means.\n\nHere is another idea that may be hard to envision but someone I know did their entire wedding in black & white. I must admit I thought it was not a good idea - but it was done with class and luxury and was the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen. All the guests agreed. I know the wedding planner of that one if you need some tips!\n\nYou can have a beautiful wedding on any budget. Love is the magical ingredient that makes it all beautiful. Often times, too much emphasis is put on the wedding and not enough on the marriage. Congratulations and best wishes on entering this exciting phase of your life! Good luck!"

"5","What are Type of digital currencies?","","What you may be referring to are so-called ""virtual currencies"" that exist in many network based multi-player games like Diablo 2.\n\nIn Diablo 2, a standard (very fun and well designed) hack-and-slash fantasy game, you can gain gold be going around a killing things. Since the game is multi-player a high level character can log on with a low level character and give them lots of money.\n\nThis has brought up a question of how these digital currencies and virtual economies will work. One main question is ""How will inflation work in an economy that is continually producing more money?"" If the high level characters are constantly racking up huge amount of gold and giving it away, what makes the game difficult anymore? Many theoretical solutions have been proposed, but none has proven to be the magic bullet that solves the problem.\n\nAnother type of digital currency is the money you're holding in your bank account. Most middle class people hold money in bank accounts rather than cash, and very few will go and withdraw all of that money at once. As a result, banks take that money and lend it out elsewhere, rarely holding more than 5-10% of the original amount in actual cash. Since this is a practice of most banks, most of the money in the economy is actually virtual, going back and forth between in digital ones and zeros across the internet; very little is kept in cash form."

What do I do?","If you can see the windows loading screen and as soon as it gets to the desktop it blanks out, its a video card refresh rate problem or resolution problem.  Usually you monitor will say 'out of range' if that happens.  If your screen is simply going blank after the compaq spash screen, it means that your computer has sucessfully completed POST (power on self test) and you probably have an IDE device causing the hangup.  Its hard to tell whats causing the hanging unless you start disconnecting hardware.  Hook up only the hard drive (set as master) on the primary master controller with no other drives present.  Also remove any uncessary PCI cards.  It it boots up then, add one piece of hardware back in at a time until you resolve the problem by process of elimination.\n\nIt could also be a power supply issue but I would need more details of how the screen goes blank. For example, the monitor tube shuts off due to no signal, or there is just a black screen (meaning that the tube is actually displaying a black screen).  Is there a blinking cursor at the top left corner?  etc."

(Source: Young Again and others)\n# Rapeseed is a lubricating oil used by small industry. It has never been meant for human consumption.\n# It is derived from the mustard family and is considered a toxic and poisonous weed, which when processed, becomes rancid very quickly.\n# It has been shown to cause lung cancer (Wall Street Journal: 6/7/95)\n# It is very inexpensive to grow and harvest. Insects won't eat it.\n# Some typical and possible side effects include loss of vision, disruption of the central nervous system, respiratory illness, anemia, constipation, increased incidence of heart disease and cancer, low birth weights in infants and irritability.\n# Generally rapeseed has a cumulative effect, taking almost 10 years before symptoms begin to manifest. It has a tendency to inhibit proper metabolism of foods and prohibits normal enzyme function. Canola is a Trans Fatty Acid, which has shown to have a direct link to cancer. These Trans Fatty acids are labeled as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Avoid all of them!\n# According to John Thomas' book, Young Again, 12 years ago in England and Europe, rape seed was fed to cows, pigs and sheep who later went blind and began attacking people. There were no further attacks after the rape seed was eliminated from their diet."

Edison is considered the most prolific inventor, holding 1,093 patents in his name. Some of these inventions were not completely original but improvements of earlier patents (most famously the Light Bulb), and were actually works of his numerous employees. Edison was sometimes criticized for not sharing the credit, but it was understood by his experimenters that all work was the property of their employer. Nevertheless, Edison received patents worldwide, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust)."""

"7","what the best way to treat with people around?","","If you mean ""treat"" as in pay for dinner or something - as opposed to giving your kid or dog a treat :) - this is the best way I've ever seen:\n\nCourtesy of a friend of mine, I have learned that the easiest way to treat for dinner & not get an arguement of discussion (in most cases) is to inform the server at the beginning of the meal, when ordering. It can be done quietly & with no fanfare - my friend tends to make as if asking a question about the menu & telling the waitstaff at that time - or you can simply precede your order with, ""And I'll be paying tonight."" Another approach is to inform the waitstaff who shows you to your table or to excuse yourself for the restroom & tell the server while you are away. In most of these situations it is an easy thing to do even if other people are around.\n\nAnother thing my friend does is that he will normally jump in to order first when he's decided that he's treating us. It can be quite funny to watch he & my husband if they've both decided to treat on the same night. One server brought the house down one evening when, as they were beginning to discuss the pay issue, she said; ""Why don't you just split the bill & be done with it?"""
"9","Why don't people divorce even if they don't have kids and know each other's unfaithfulness?","","This is a complex question with no one simple answer. But it general it comes down to boundaries. For some people, infidelity is a strong boundary that they will not tolerate being violated. It can also shatter trust beyond repair. But other people are willing to give their partner a chance to earn back their trust. Still others stay married for religious or financial reasons, and some have self-esteem issues and don't believe they are worthy of a partner who doesn't cheat on them. There are more possibilities, but these are a few of the common ones.\nDr. Barb Nefer, www.bnlifeskills.com"

There is no other feeling quite like it. \n I believe with a great deal of practice that you can control your thought pattern, so that no thought enters it for a short period. It is not easy, especially with the possibility of distraction. But it can be done and it centers you, you will feel more energy, having clearer thought process and many other benefits. This has been said to be a religion of sorts but that is not how I ever used it, I would use to just relax for myself not to give money to someone for a word to repeat to get to that state. Find one word , preferably single syllable and use that as your mantra. It usually has a meaning special only to you and how can anyone tell you that.\nYou can slow down if not totally end the thought process for a short time with practice. It does not work for all but for some its a blessing."

Sinclair was born in Baltimore, but his family moved to New York when he was a child. When he was a teenager he began writing brief bits for newspapers and magazines. The Jungle was his sixth novel, and its success made him nationally famous. An exposé of the Chicago meatpacking industry, the book helped change national regulations on food preparation and earned him enough money to establish the Helicon Home Colony, a socialist community in New Jersey. Although the community only lasted about a year (it burned down in 1907), Sinclair remained committed to social causes and to exposing the dangerous effects of capitalism in realistic fiction, essays and various other writings. In 1915 he moved to California, where he ran unsuccessfully for public office several times, including running for governor as a Democrat in 1934. In the 1940s Sinclair again had popular success with the ""Lanny Budd"" series of novels, beginning with World's End (1940) and including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dragon's Teeth (1942). In 1953 Sinclair moved to Arizona, where he continued to write books, including working his 1932 autobiography, American Outpost, into The Autobiography of Upton Sinclair (1962).\n\nHe is not related to Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair.\n\nFOUR GOOD LINKS\n\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Good general summary of his career\n    * The California EPIC Movement, 1934\n      Historical pieces about Sinclair's bid for governor\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Letters from Jack London and the text of The Jungle\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Hyperlinked biographical essay"

"4","are online courses people take harder to do or is it easier in a classroom?","","I have been taking online courses now for almost a year and a half and have found that the program is very rewarding!  I have felt alot less pressure than having traditional classroom instruction.  Although there are several different aspects of online courses, there are many things that have been done through many colleges and universities to bring the online students together.  For example, with the classes that I have taken, there is a discussion board that allows you and other classmates to post interesting topics and help each other with puzzling issues that may arise during the completion of coursework.  In addition, if extra help is needed, there is generally a phone number that you can call for technical support or for assistance.  This can prove to be especially useful when you are enrolled in a math course.  You can e-mail assignments whenever you like, watch lectures on DVD or videotape whenever you like, and do classwork at your convenience.  It actually saves alot of time since you don't have to commute to school and spend alot of time getting ready to go to class.  You can sit at home and do your work in your pajamas! :o)  One thing that I would highly recommend is that you be mindful of the concept of networking and forming outside interests while you are completing your coursework.  Since you are not physically attending classes at a college or university, you still need sufficient time for social activities.  Some colleges give you a start date and an end date to complete coursework.  It is up to you to plan your schedule accordingly.  If you do decide to take an online class, I would recommend that you establish a schedule immediately for your coursework when you get the syllabus and list of assignments.  Make sure that you complete the assignments in a timely fashion.  It also helps to have a buddy that will hold you accountable for completing your reading and written assignments.  I'm sure that this policy will vary from college to college, but when it comes time to take exams, often times with the online class, the professor will not give a time limit and you can take all the time that you want to complete your exam in the presence of a proctor.  This really takes off alot of pressure.  Allow for plenty of time to complete assignments and if you can do it, try to complete your coursework in advance.  If you are an independent learner and don't like to waste time, online classes might be for you.  I hope that some of these suggestions may be helpful to you.  If you want to talk more about online classes, you may shoot me a note."

Whether you use WEP or WPA encryption, you will need a passphrase.  Some router firmwares will generate a code for you, but you can create one yourself.  Just be sure that you make a record of it someplace in a text file.\n\nOnce you enter the passphrase in the router and reboot it, all the wireless adapters in your network will need to add that passphrase to the profile set up for your network.  Most newer adapter utilities have a Connection Wizard that helps you enter it correctly.\n\nOnce all your adapters are updated, you should be all set.

You are minding your own business on a hot summer day, eating something like an ice cream cone, a milk shake, a Slurpee, a snow cone... Then, suddenly you are hit with the most excruciating headache! Fortunately it only lasts about 30 seconds. \n\nSo where does this headache come from? \n\nI have not seen a better answer to the question than in this article by Joseph Hulihan. It's a little technical, but it contains some great information. Here's a summary: When something cold touches the roof of your mouth on a hot day, it triggers a cold headache. The cause is a dilation of blood vessels in the head. The dilation may be caused by a nerve center located above the roof of your mouth -- when this nerve center gets cold, it seems to over-react and tries to heat your brain. \n\nTherefore, the easy way to avoid ""brain freeze"" is to keep cold things away from the roof of your mouth!"

While Michael has lost most of his American following due to his legal issues, he is still one of the top recording artists in European and Asian countries. Madonna, on the other hand, continues to re-invent herself with each new album. This is shown in her most recent release of ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"".

The rate in Washington D.C.(among others) is 80.6 per 100,000. That means that you are about 25% more likely to be shot and killed in our nation capitol, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, than you are in Iraq. Conclusion: We should immediately pull out of Washington, DC.","I agree wholeheartedly, but only if we leave all of the politicians, along with the thugs.  Everyone else can withdraw immediately, including the families of the thugs and politicians.  Hurricane Katrina survivors can house the families of the politicians and corporate sponsors can take care of the families of the thugs.

This is handy, because Public Folder trees can grow very long, and managing Public Folders on a per-folder basis can become tedious."""

"7","What came first the chicken or the egg?","","This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?"

I have seen the other frequences represented as numbers, and assumed they were all rounded, but I want to verify.\n\nA4 (standard tuning frequency) = 440 Hz","Yes.  Because the frequency of the notes are a geometric sequence with a factor of 2^(1/12) between each note, and 2^(n/12) is irrational except for when n is divisible by 12.  There are 12 half-steps in an octave.\n\nThe frequency of A (just below middle C) is 220 Hz.  So the frequency of a note that is one half-step above A is 220*(2^(1/12)).  Two half-steps up is 220*(2^(2/12))."

SETI@home uses P2P with just under 4 million computers and has, since it started in July 1999 (to August 2002) done 1,009,000 hrs of computation time, or the equivalent of 1,248 years work on one computer! ...\nwww.techdirectcomputers.com/Encyclopedia.htm\n\nA programme which will allow the MOD to trade electronically with its suppliers, via the Defence Electronic Commerce Service (DECS).\nwww.ams.mod.uk/ams/content/docs/ils/ils_web/ils_gide/chaptr14.htm\n\nPeer to Peer. Term used by file sharing networks such as Kazaa, Limewire, etc.\nwww.100best-web-hosting.com/termp.html\n\nP2P technically stands for ""peer-to-peer."" A peer-to-peer architecture allows hardware or software to function on a network without the need for central servers. Peer-to-peer is commonly used in configuring home computer networks where the cost of a server can be difficult to justify. The approach has also been popularized by some Net software applications such as Groove and Napster. The P2P acronym has acquired a non-technical meaning as well. ...\nwww.envisionnetwork.net/library/glossary.html\n\nA peer-to-peer (or P2P) computer network is a network that relies on computing power at the edges (ends) of a connection rather than in the network itself. P2P networks are used for sharing content like audio, video, data or anything in digital format. P2P network can also mean grid computing. \nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2P"

"2","nonlinear programming?","","A Nonlinear Program (NLP) is a problem that can be put into the form\n\n    minimize   F(x)\n\n    subject to gi(x)  = 0    for i = 1, ..., m1       where m1 >= 0\n               hj(x) >= 0    for j = m1+1, ..., m     where m >= m1\n\nThat is, there is one scalar-valued function F, of several variables (x here is a vector), that we seek to minimize subject (perhaps) to one or more other such functions that serve to limit or define the values of these variables. F is called the ""objective function"", while the various other functions are called the ""constraints"". (If maximization is sought, it is trivial to do so, by multiplying F by -1.)\n\nBecause NLP is a difficult field, researchers have identified special cases for study. A particularly well studied case is the one where all the constraints g and h are linear. The name for such a problem, unsurprisingly, is ""linearly constrained optimization"". If, as well, the objective function is quadratic at most, this problem is called Quadratic Programming (QP). An even more special case of great importance is where the objective function and the constraints are entirely linear; this is called Linear Programming (LP) and is discussed in a separate FAQ list. Another important special case, called unconstrained optimization, is where there are no constraints at all.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in NLP is that some problems exhibit ""local optima""; that is, spurious solutions that merely satisfy the requirements on the derivatives of the functions. Think of a near-sighted mountain climber in a terrain with multiple peaks, and you'll see the difficulty posed for an algorithm that tries to move from point to point only by climbing uphill. Algorithms that propose to overcome this difficulty are termed ""Global Optimization"".\n\nThe word ""Programming"" is used here in the sense of ""planning""; the necessary relationship to computer programming was incidental to the choice of name. Hence the phrase ""NLP program"" to refer to a piece of software is not a redundancy, although I tend to use the term ""code"" instead of ""program"" to avoid the possible ambiguity. \n\nThe sites below are quite good. If you want a career in Operations Research or Retailing Management, NLP is a gr8 plus to learn"

When you press the Record button, Audacity will capture whatever sound is playing on your computer's speakers.\n\nIf this doesn't work on your computer, you can instead use a cable to connect your computer's “Line Out” (speaker) port to its “Line In” port, and use Audacity to record from Line In."""

They have an excellent resource for free and also recommend some other websites such as the Small Business Association.  The best advice I got when researching different franchises was to call and speak with as many current franchise owners as well as those that have left the franchise.  I was at the end of a 4-month process with a franchise, very close to sending my deposit, when I spoke with an owner that changed my mind.  I had spoken with over 20 owners and this person made it all clear.  Point is, this franchise was ranked in the top 100 of Entrepreneur Magazines Franchises and my personal research saved me from making a huge mistake.\n\nGood luck!"

Erlang, the originator of traffic engineering and queueing theory.\n\nIn the traffic calculation, one Erlang implies a single resource in continuous use (or two channels at fifty percent use, and so on, pro rata). For example, if a bank has two tellers and they are both busy the whole time, that would represent two erlang of traffic.\n\nThe traffic measured in erlang is used to determine if a system is over- or under-provisioned (has too many or too few resources allocated).\n\nThe traffic measured over many busy hours might be used for a T1 or E1 circuit group to determine how many voice lines are in use at the busiest hours. For example, if no more than 12 out of 24 channels are ever in use at any given time, the other 12 might be made available as data channels.\n\nTraffic measured in erlang is used to calculate grade of service (GoS) or quality of service (QoS).\n\nThere are a range of different Erlang formulae, including Erlang B, Extended Erlang B, Erlang C and a related Engset formula to calculate GoS"

Anyone else had things rejected for no good reason? This was the third such rejection in two days!\nAny ideas? Thanks much.","I think it may have been a valid reason to the person that complained and Customer Care, if not to you. The reason why is no one else had the background info that you did in your mind; you knew they where all singers and that by listing 3 similar people you where attempting to indicate a comparison, but this is VERY vague to someone who doesnt know what you where thinking when you wrote it. Three names; who the heck are these people? Question mark; what does he want to know??? \n\nNo offence, but I am sure I would have reported it as not a question or at least posted a response asking you to elaborate as well. The way to avoid this type of response from others it to take the time to ask a full question with detail...think of a quiz for school where they simply list three  names of historic figures followed by a question mark...would you know that your teacher wanted you to compare their effect on the civilized world as it is today, with no other information, or would you fail miserably? My point is, do as you did with this question; fill the reader in on all the important parts they need to come up with a good answer for you. Read it again before you post it to see if it will make sense to others.\n\nHope this helps to clarify the situation. Good luck with all your future questions!"

And ask him to come into your heart and forgive you for your sins. He will forgive you and accept you as his child. Then when you die, if you die before the Lord comes back, you will go to heaven and live with him. This is where others will be living happily and you can enjoy it with them and serve the Lord.\n\nThe other way would be going to Hell when you die. And this way is the opposite of choosing God. If you deny him, and don't believe in him, and never ask him to come into your heart, you will go to Hell and burn eternally.\n\nAnd This is the truth.

"7","I am a fresh graduate of civil engineering and will like to work in the oil and gas?","sector.How do i get a job in this sector in Nigeria?","You will find you are in high demand. In Nigeria you can choose from Shell, Total, Chevron, Exxon, and many others. Most of them will be willing to give you additional training, and all of the multinationals are seeking to increase their employment of Nigerian nationals. You may also discover that the pay scale in the oil industry is higher than other industry, and that you will sometimes have the opportunity for world travel.  \n\nI suggest going to the website of any oil company you are interested in and applying. I know Shell and Chevron have this capacity. You might also do well simply by going to their local office and either speaking to the HR department or an engineering manager. Good luck. I will be looking forward to your contribution to the industry.\n\nBy the way, there are fraud operations out there that promise jobs in the oil industry- please don't pay anyone to help you get a job. It isn't necessary."
"7","Can any business legally change the price of its offering based on the demand (like Airline companies) ?","","Generally, yes.  There are exceptions though.\n\nOne of the principles behind capitalism is that buyers and sellers are able to freely make decisions about whether to buy or sell, and at what price.  If a seller raises his price, buyers should be able to buy less, or buy from someone else.\n\nIf a company has a monopoly, then the buyers have no choice about where to buy.  So there are laws and regulations about how monopolies can behave.  Examples of monopolies include power companies, and cable companies.\n\nSometimes in natural disasters, some sellers take advantage of the situation to raise prices of things like gas or water by huge amounts.  While some may argue that this is the principle of free markets, others feel that this is unfair to disaster victims who have no other options.  So there are ""price gouging"" laws in some places that forbid this kind of thing.\n\nAnd then there's price fixing, which means communicating with your competitors and raising prices together.  Again, this is seen as unfair, and so is illegal.  Some of the airlines were guilty of this a long time ago.\n\nThere are some other minor restrictions on pricing, but for the most part, aside from doing these things that are considered grossly unfair, businesses are generally free to price however they want."

"2","ISTR there's some trick with picking up a chair that women can do but men can't.  What is it?","I think it had to do with the structure of the hips, which is different in men and women.

Does anyone know it?","Yes, the ""trick"" is to put a straight back chair against the wall, then lean over it with you forehead against the wall, and pick up the chair.\n\nWomen can do it and men cannot. It does have to do with bone structure,  however, I cannot remember if it is hips or pelvis. But it is one of the two."

"7","In oil fields, why do the pipes have a raised 'upside down U' every so often?","Driving through Bakersfield, California, we notice white pipes in the oilfields that we presume are transporting the oil.   Every so often, the pipe rises off the ground in an upside down U shape and then continues. It seems that would make it hard for the oil to flow through, and we wonder what it's purpose is.","The gas that also comes up in the pipes is lighter than the oil so it rises as far as it can and then gets trapped in the ""U"" in order to avoid explosions."

"1","Why does it matter if priests are celibate?","It certainly isn't unhuman to have sex.  Why is it unholy?  Does that mean being holy is unhuman?","Celibacy is defined as not only ""Abstinence from sexual intercourse, especially by reason of religious vows"" but also is ""The condition of being unmarried."" So I don't think it's about declaring the sex is unholy/unhuman but rather about a ""voluntary refusal to enter the married state"".\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 7:32-34a it says that ""I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs—how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—and his interests are divided.""\n\nI think that the reason for celibacy as it is stated in the previous passage that getting married forces you to balance two things, your relationship with God and your wife (I'm sure this is a universal truth that all married men understand how demanding a wife can be). However, it doesn't necessarily imply that Priests shouldn't be married."
"2","why is the sky blue?","","It is called Rayleigh Scattering, or Molecular scattering.  This is primarily caused by oxygen and nitrogen molecules, whose effective diameters are at least 0.1 times smaller than the effected wavelengths.  Rayleigh scattering is most influential at the alitudes above 4.5 km, occuring in what is called the pure atmosphere.  The amount of Rayleigh scattering is highly selective, being inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength.  Consequently, invisible ultraviolet radiation, at a wavelength of 0.3 micrometers, is scattered 16 times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  In the visible spectrum, blue wavelengths at 0.4 micrometers are scattered about five times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  The preferential scattering of blue wavelengths explains why the clear sky appears blue in daylight.  The blue wavelengths reach our eyes from all parts of the sky."

"4","what is theimportance of online libraries?","","There are several advantages to the online resources \nthat libraries make available:\n\nThey allow multiple people to utilize one resource at the same time (with print resources, multiple copies must be held by the library to achieve this).\n\nThey allow people to use the library's resources without physically going to the library.  This is especially important for distance education students who may not live anywhere near the school they attend.\n\nThey can be more easily recovered if the physical location is impacted by a disaster.  If the resources are hosted via the internet, all the library has to do is repair or replace its computer equipment, as opposed to hunting down and purchasing replacement copies of destroyed print materials. \n\nOn the downside, online resources are generally more expensive than print, and some things are priced so extravagantly that some libraries can't afford them at all."

"1","Will there ever be peace on earth?","","Yes there ever can be peace on earth. My assertion can happen but not without the mutual efforts of civilize societies to eradicate religious extremism which breeds terrorism. There is need for educating many religious zealots - ""extremists"", who think they are the best in culture/tradition and so their religion is the best and most perfect. Thus they choose to call them of other religious sects or them without religious affiliations as infidels. These religious extremists are trully ignorant and don't use their education little or enough to enhance their social standing. They are always not curious or anxious to pry their holy books but are at the mercy of their religious leaders to brainwash them - ""MASTER says"". May I suggest that civil religious persons and society - both christians, moslems, hindus, budhists, etc should know noone was created infidel by God. God scales noone infidel. The extremists should be taught to respect everyone's social or religious standing. The whole civilize world should educate rather than support these zealots and there ever will be peace on earth."

Should I tell her now, I don't want her in it?  \n\nI have tried suggesting other ways she can be involved and she just stomps that down and says, ""Nope, I am going to be a bridesmaid.""  What do I do?","You're not engaged (yet)...so there's really no reason to worry (as of yet).  Once you are, you ask who YOU want and obviously you don't ask this friend.  If she's hurt and disappears from your life over it, she is not a REAL/TRUE friend.  I know what this is like as I am engaged and I watched a friend have to have 2 maids of honor because her cousin believed she was THE maid of honor the way your friend believes she is going to be a bridesmaid and my friend was miserable on her wedding day because of it!  That is the other part to consider, IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR DAY, ALL ABOUT Y-O-U...it's just about the only day in your life when it will be ""OK"" to be as selfish and/or self-absorbed as you possibly want..within clear reason of course...after all, half the day will belong to your fiance, too! ;)  Seriously, if you don't want her in, don't ask her.  If she still persists, tell her again bluntly...if that doesn't work I really don't know any other nice way to put it.  She can go on in her dream world...but without you telling her which dress, color and other need-to-know details surrounding bridesmaid-land, she'll never be able to pull off her own fantasy.

"7","Whats the best stock?","","What is the best stock is a question subject to great uncertainty. In other words, it is sort of like betting on a horse prior to a horse race. Certain companies sell at higher price to earnings ratios than others. These are the 2-1 bets.  Other stocks have low price to earnings ratios. These are the 20-1 long shots. The market at any time tends to price each stock in relation to its earnings potential, its dividend, and other factors.  If the market were 100% efficient, then all stocks would be equally good. There is a good deal of rational for this reasoning. One rational is that the vast majority of mutual funds-75%--tend to underperform the average stock. Some of their underperformance is due to their expenses. Some is due to the fact that no matter what they buy, it will tend not to perform any bettern than the market in general. \n\nAs a result many mutual funds and exchange traded funds have come to market that try to match the market in general. In other words they have thrown in the towel in trying to pick the best stocks.  \n\nBut!!!  Mutual funds have to invest a LOT of money billions of dollars.  With that much money to invest they have a problem.  They just can not find a good stock and dump a billion dollars into it.  \n\nSince you do not have a billion to invest (my assumption based on the fact that if you did you would not be asking this question here) you may be able to beat the market.  Some do and some do not. \n\nI have no idea what the best stock is? I doubt that whoever you asked would have any idea. \n\nHere are a couple of suggestions though.\n\nDo you think that more easy oil will be discovered? If the answer is no, you might consider an oil stock. Another advantage of owning an oil stock is that when the price at the pump goes up 25 cents you won't feel so bad. \n\nDo you think that we are at the top of a housing bubble similar to the internet bubble?  If the answer is yes, you may want to avoid the stock market all together and put you dinero into T-bills. \n\nDo you think that there will be more and more old people? If the answer is yes, you may want to buy some health care stock."

"2","how fast is the earth rotating on its axis?","","Firstly 1 day per revolution strictly isn't 24 hours since one revolution is completed in 23Hours 56minutes giving us the leap year phenomenon.\n\nIt takes 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds for the Earth complete on revolution. \n86164.09 Seconds in total.\n\nRadians per second is the standard measurement for angular momentum (speed). The SI Unit for this is rad.s^-1\n\nEarths Angular Momentum = 2π/86164.09s\n= 7.2921159 x 10^-5 rad/s\n\nIf you want to know the avarage speed expressed in distance over time you need to find the circumference of the earth of your location. Lets use the equator as an example which is aprox 40076km.\n\n40076km x 1000 {Convert to Meters}\n= 40076000m\n\n40076000m/86164.09s \n= 465.11255 m/s (meters per second)\n= 1674 km/s (kilometers per hour)\n= 1047 miles per hour\n\n\nIf you want to know the spesific speed for you location find the latatude on a map and substitute \n\nCircumference = 2 pi r cos(x),\nwhere \npi = 3.14159...\nr = the earth's equatorial radius = 6378Km \nx = the angle of latitude. (Your location on Map)\n\nNow multiply your answer by 1000 to get distance in meters and devide by 86164.09 to get the speed in meteres per second."

"3","What could cause profound hearing loss in one ear only for a small child, other than injury?","","a couple of answers to that question:\n\ndepending on how small the child is, the profound hearing loss may have been there from the time the child was born, but was only noticed as a consequence of a workup for something else (eg, an injury).\n\nBut, assuming the hearing loss is new in onset, the question becomes a bit more difficult to answer:  there are two types of hearing loss, one which is the result of a loss of the nerve and hearing organs, and one which is the result of fluid buildup in the middle ear space or a rupture of the tympanic membrane\n\nIt is rare for fluid or TM rupture to cause ""profound"" hearing loss (if you use the official definition of ""profound""), but it can definitely cause a significant amount of deafness.\n\nNeural hearing loss can be caused by injury.  It can also be caused by viral infections, though this is more common in adults.  And it can be congenital but late-manifesting."
"3","what is OCD ?","does it have anything to do with Bi Polar?","OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder.  It has absolutely nothing to do with bipolar disorder.  Most people think that OCD only covers the repeditive completeing of tasks or paranoia, but actually there are many branches of OCD.  There are the checkers, who repeatedly check things such as whether or not the locked their cars, there are the cleaners, who are petrified of germs and compulsively clean everything, there are the 'moral nuts' who are constanly terrified of committing 'sins' and there are the pure obsessionals, who have unwanted violent thoughts concerning death, suicide, murder, or sexual activities.  These are only some versions of OCD, and everyone who has it has a slightly different condition.  No one is sure exactly what causes OCD, although it is believed to be an imballance of chemicals in the brain, and seems to be hereditary.  OCD is a very prevalent disorder, although most forms of it are mild, and almost all forms are manageable with the propper tools."
"1","""PICCADILLY""..the most famouse name in London .what does it mean ?","","Piccadilly (pĭk'ədĭl'ē) , street of the City of Westminster borough, London, England. Starting at Piccadilly Circus (London's center of traffic and amusement), it runs to Hyde Park Corner. The street is lined with shops, hotels, and clubs. The Albany, a club, was the residence of T. B. Macaulay, W. E. Gladstone, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and George Canning.\n\nThe name arises from a tailor named Robert Baker, who owned a shop in The Strand in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling picadils (stiff collars with scalloped edges and a broad laced or perforated border), that were then in fashion. With his great fortune he purchased a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London and in about 1612 he built a large house there. The mansion soon became known as Piccadilly Hall.\n\nThere was a British film made in 1929 called ""Piccadilly"".\n\n\nPiccadilly is a major London street, running from Hyde Park Corner in the west to Piccadilly Circus in the east. The street is part of the A4 road, London's main western artery, and runs alongside a number of famous buildings and sites, including Green Park.\n\nIt is the location of Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy and The Ritz Hotel. Simpson, once amongst the nation's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now occupied by the booksellers Waterstones.\n\nThe Piccadilly Line of the London Underground takes its name from Piccadilly and part of the line travels under Piccadilly. Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus tube stations all have entrances either on or near to Piccadilly.\n\n\nPiccadilly (1929) was a British film directed by Ewald André Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Anna May Wong, Gilda Gray and Jameson Thomas. It has been re-released by Milestone Films after an extensive restoration. It appeared in theatres in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005 it was released on DVD."

"7","How do you increase affordable workforce housing in a high growth, yet low wage, area?","I live in St. George, Utah (the second fastest growing metro area in the country according to the US Census Bureau a few months ago).  Thus, housing prices are high (not as bad as some parts of the USA) while wages are low.  People who accept jobs here cannot afford to live here unless they have a lot of money coming into the area.  The real growth industries are construction and service, and those usually aren't that high of paying.  To compound this problem, a lot of retirees with money retire here, Southern California cash out their equity in their Californian homes and move here with money, and investors with money buy properties to rent.  That does not help the worker who has no money and not a high enough wage to buy a house.  Many commute to Las Vegas about two hours away since wages are higher there.  Any ideas on how to allievate this problem?","Your question is a tough one as it appears you are attemting to see how one can increase home ownership in a changing market due to demand.\n\nThis is a problem throuhout America, where its an honor to find decent affordbale housing.\n\nMany communities and governments are working with Grant Money, zoning ordinances to improve the existing housing inventory.\n\nIf the busineess climate is improving, I would suggest there are opportunities for those who may have skills such as landscaping, masonary, small resturants and those who are moving to the area may need.\n\nReal Estate will also be in demand and those in the community may need to improve there level of skills with the change, thus creating a level of economics that will support the purchasing of a home.\n\nI just looked at Realtor.com and found multiple properties under $150,000, opportunities do exist."
"5","How would u find out whether a device is acting as a host or a router using an SNMP command?","","Mind you that many hosts (e.g. workstation, laptop) do have multiple network interfaces and could technically act as a router.\n\nIn that case if you are an authorized SNMP manager, you can try to view the machine's ipRouteTable (more on that see http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2096.html.)  The table's content would tell you if this machine is configured to route/forward IP packets, hence acting as a router."
"4","prove triangels are similar if their side are respectivel parallel to eac other?","","By the definition of Similar triangles - ""Two Triangles are similar if their respective angles are the equal"".\nHence if you have two triangles (A and B) whose respective sides are parallel, then, it means that either triangles A and B are identical or that A is a magnified or diminished version of B. In either case, their angles will be equal hence making them ""Similar""\nTo test this. Draw a triangle (A) on a sheet of paper. Try to draw lines parallel to the sides of triangle A. Ensure that the angles of the new triangle (B) that you are drawing are the exact same as A. You will notice that B is either the exact same as A, A zoomed out or zoomed in version of triangle A"
"10","i need to get a visa for someone who lives in the Philippines to come here and marry me. where do i start?","","Contrary to common sense, the quickest way is NOT to marry her in the Philippines. It is usually faster to get her a fiancee visa, and marry when she comes to U.S. (You have to check for the specific country though).\n\nTo start the process, you need to submit the I-129F petition for fiancee visa to the USCIS. The form is at: http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-129f.htm\n\nAfter this gets processed, your fiancee can go to a U.S. embassy for an visa interview.\n\nMarriage visa (K3) takes up to a year to process, while fiancee visa (K1) takes much less (~4 months from petition to visa issued in Bangkok, Thailand, different in different countries).\n\nNote that you also have a slightly more difficult/expensive, but potentially faster option of enrolling her in a U.S. college or English study program, and getting her a student visa (F1)"

Therefore if we stop subdivision of matter doesnt it mean that the so called smallest particle is not made up of anything else?And if it's so,doesnt it mean that it cant exist without a subparticle??And this means that stopping subdivision of particle means simply wiping out it's existence...Umm Am i right?(I want an xplanation for ur answer by the way Not yes or no)","There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect.  The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave.  A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass.  And mass requires weight.  This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected.  But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc.  This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.

"2","what is the length and duration of one revolution of the sun around the center of the milkyway galixy?","I am trying to calculate the distance traveled (In light years) for a 46 year old person at 38 north latitude. Including the rotation of earth , orbit around the sun and the suns revolution around the center of the milkyway. I don't think I can go farther than that as I don't beleve there is a center to the universe the galixys travel could be measured aginst. Mike","Firstly, the milky way is in a galatic cluster, and that is in a super cluster.  (There's a lot of gravity out there.)  But those structures are too far away to detect sideway movement, only towards or away.  Also, their motion is highly relativistic.  So Galaxy is a natural place to stop.\n\nThe first figure will probably be within the margin of error for the second and third.  So, as I check wikipedia, I see that the sun is orbitting the galaxy at a rate of 217 kilometer per second and the earth is rotating around the sun at 29.783 km/s.  So, this person has traveled somewhere in excess (depending on how many seconds more than 46 years old they are) of 358,242,443,236.8 kilometers, or 222,468,557,250.0528 miles.  \n\nAlso, just as a comment, there is no ""point"" of the big bang.

"2","if i was traveling in a vehicle at the speed of light and turned on the headlights would they work?","","No. well, its absolutely impossible to travel at or faster then the speed of light, but lets pretend you can so i can actually give you an answer to the question. The speed of light is actually the ultimate speed limit to the universe, nothing can travel faster than light, so although you would expect the light to be going at twice the speed of light (you plus the speed of light)it can't because it is physically impossible for even light to travel faster than the speed of light so it would be going slower than you and not reach any path in front of you. Of course, if you turned on your headlights before you started moving, the light would be one step ahead of you.\n\nOf course, still, nothing can go faster then the speed of light because in the formula for time dialation(time slows down for an object moving close to the speed of light) t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) where t' is the time passing for an outside observer, t is the time that passes for the object going at the high velocity, v is velocity, speed is the speed of light and ^2 is squared. (note: this formula is definately correct, it's part of einstein's theory of relativity and I've had to derive it myself for class in the past) so if v was bigger than c, you would have a number greater than one and therefore a negative number under a square root, which is impossible."

What could be wrong?","I am a woman, 45 yrs. old and I'd say it was only about a month and I brushed my hair, and went to put it in a pony tail and it feels extremely thinned out. I don't have patches, but I had thick hair and now I have thin hair, very thin.","I had a very simaler problem and after seeing a nutritionist i learned that i was not eating enough protein. If you are concerned go to your doctor. Some blood tests can be run and you may feel better about it knowing whats causing it. There are so many different explinations for hair loss though. Good luck."
"2","what is perceptual control theory?","","Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and human behavior originated by William T. Powers.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Control_Theory#History\n\nIn contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT finds that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions.\n\nPCT differs from engineering control theory in that the reference variable for each negative feedback control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by a separate controller.\n\nThe Control Systems Group is a non-profit professional organization of individuals involved in research in and applications of perceptual control theory."
"7","i dont know how to save money,?","i have a new car and house and a nice job, but i reallt dont know how to save money, if i have money i always end up spending it.","Well first of all, that is not a question, it is a statement.  Yet I am going to assume that you are trying to say ""How can you save money?"" and will answer that question.  I'm sure you have heard of saving 10% of every paycheck and put it into long-term saings.  This is the most important concept in investing and savings.  Yet for most people it is impossible to find space in their budgets.  The only way for many people that this works is to put the money directly into a CD (certificate of deposit - a type of bank account).  This way it is not at all tempting to spend it when you get it.  There is a way to get this done automaticaly, yet I don't really know how (I am 15).  \n\nAll of this is explained in the book ""The Wealthy Barber"" by David Chilton.  If you were to only read one book in your life, this one is the one you should read.  It goes through basic savings and investment skills while putting it in a way that is entertaining and simple to understand.  Everyone should read this book and everyone can accieve a happy retirement if they follow the advice put forth by Dave.  It is amazing how simple the suggestions that he says are to implement."

"3","Is there any proven ""natural"" or nutricinal way to treat Bi-polar Disorder??","","There is an issue of selfmedicating, it is not a healthy form of treatment. I am bi-polar and from the many years of experience, all the drugs I have done has caused a degree of damage.\n  As for a natural way of relieving symptoms, well meditating helps sometimes, but what to do when it does not. I then self medicate. This is a cycle that all go through when they have bi polar. There is not one person that i have met who has not self medicated. Its a reaction to the panic. \n  A doctor once told me that i would have to take valium or like drugs for the rest of my life if I chose medication. After a near 15years, I have been on and off bezo's and in and out of rehab. \n  Good luck to us all on this wonderful burden that we carry in our lives. It is sad that our loved ones must wittness us going through this, but I also believe that it gives us a sight that others do not have,"
"8","who wrote Swan Lake?","","Swan Lake (Russian: Лебединое Озеро) is one of the most famous and critically-acclaimed ballets, with music by Tchaikovsky.\n\nThe original ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia on February 20, 1877 and remained in the repertoire until 1883. After Tchaikovsky's death, the ballet was revised by his brother Modest and the conductor Riccardo Drigo. This revised version received its premiere at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg on January 15, 1895 with choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, and many later stagings have followed their work more or less closely.\n\nA single dancer dances the twin roles of Odette and Odile, which is one of the most taxing of all roles because it requires acting two entirely contrasting characters, as well as the strenuous showpiece dancing itself, including thirty-two fouettés. This feat was put into the choreography because it was a party piece of Pierina Legnani, first prima ballerina assoluta of the Maryinsky ballet. Pavel Gerdt played Prince Siegfried.\n\nThe ballet's premiere in St. Petersburg was very poorly received. It had lackluster costumes and scenery, unusual choreography, and a mediocre orchestra. It also departed from the traditional Russian format of ballet, which used a story with just enough plot to sustain the virtuoso dancing; Tchaikovsky's ballet, on the other hand, included a well-unified storyline which lost much of the audience. A later revival in the year after Tchaikovsky's death was acclaimed as a masterpiece, however, having used phenomenal talent in all aspects."
